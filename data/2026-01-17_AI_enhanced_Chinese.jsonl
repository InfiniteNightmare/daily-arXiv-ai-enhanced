Evaluation across seven edge AI workload profiles, including real ML inference with ONNX Runtime MobileNetV2, demonstrates 93.9% average efficiency. Comparative experiments with Python 3.13t (free threading) show that while GIL elimination enables ~4x throughput on multi-core edge devices, the saturation cliff persists on single-core devices, validating our beta metric for both GIL and no-GIL environments.

STMs simplify atomicity. Recent STMs can achieve good performance for some workloads but they have some limitations.

Multiversioning is a common approach used to support this type of workload. However, multiversioning is often expensive and can reduce the performance of transactions where versioning is not necessary. In this work we present Multiverse, a new STM that combines the best of both unversioned TM and multiversioning. Multiverse features versioned and unversioned transactions which can execute concurrently. A main goal of Multiverse is to ensure that unversioned transactions achieve performance comparable to the state of the art unversioned STM while still supporting fast versioned transactions needed to enable long running reads. We implement Multiverse and compare it against several STMs. Our experiments demonstrate that Multiverse achieves comparable or better performance for common case workloads where there are no long running reads. For workloads with long running reads and frequent updates Multiverse significantly outperforms existing STMS. In several cases for these workloads the throughput of Multiverse is several orders of magnitude faster than other STMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We use these two premises to construct a taxonomy of survival stories, in which humanity survives into the far future. In each survival story, one of the two premises fails. Either scientific barriers prevent AI systems from becoming extremely powerful; or humanity bans research into AI systems, thereby preventing them from becoming extremely powerful; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because their goals prevent them from doing so; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because we can reliably detect and disable systems that have the goal of doing so.

Distinguished from the existing homogeneous settings that assume each worker holds the same number of datasets, where the data assignment is carefully designed and controlled by the data center (e.g., the cyclic assignment), we consider a more general setting with arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment across workers, where `arbitrary' means that the data assignment is given in advance and `heterogeneous' means that the workers may hold different numbers of datasets. Our objective is to characterize the fundamental tradeoff between the computable dimension of the task function and the communication cost under arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment.

However, most existing methods rely on static, one-shot visual inputs and passive perception, lacking the ability to adaptively determine when, whether, and how to observe the interface. We present GUI-Eyes, a reinforcement learning framework for active visual perception in GUI tasks. To acquire more informative observations, the agent learns to make strategic decisions on both whether and how to invoke visual tools, such as cropping or zooming, within a two-stage reasoning process. To support this behavior, we introduce a progressive perception strategy that decomposes decision-making into coarse exploration and fine-grained grounding, coordinated by a two-level policy. In addition, we design a spatially continuous reward function tailored to tool usage, which integrates both location proximity and region overlap to provide dense supervision and alleviate the reward sparsity common in GUI environments. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, GUI-Eyes-3B achieves 44.8% grounding accuracy using only 3k labeled samples, significantly outperforming both supervised and RL-based baselines.

We investigate whether multi-agent systems function as strategic reasoners capable of payoff optimization or as identity-driven actors that prioritize role alignment over explicit incentives. Using Nash equilibrium achievement as a diagnostic for strategic reasoning, we conduct systematic experiments across four LLM architectures (Qwen-7B, Qwen-32B, Llama-8B, Mistral-7B) in complex environmental decision-making games involving four agents. We show that role identity bias fundamentally alters strategic reasoning even when payoff-optimal equilibria exist and complete payoff information is available. Removing personas and providing explicit payoffs enables Qwen models to achieve high Nash equilibrium rates, indicating that both conditions are necessary for strategic reasoning. In contrast, personas systematically bias equilibrium selection toward socially preferred outcomes: with personas present, all of the achieved equilibria correspond to Green Transition, while models entirely fail to reach equilibrium when Tragedy of the Commons is payoff-optimal. The effect of explicit payoffs depends entirely on persona presence, revealing strong interactions between representational design choices. We also observe clear model-dependent patterns. Qwen architectures are highly sensitive to both personas and payoff visibility, whereas Llama and Mistral exhibit rigid reasoning behavior across conditions.

Most FD discovery algorithms find all valid dependencies, but this causes two problems. First, the computational cost is prohibitive: computational complexity grows quadratically with the number of tuples and exponentially with the number of attributes, making discovery slow on large-scale and high-dimensional data. Second, the result set can be huge, making it hard to identify useful dependencies. We propose SDP (Selective-Discovery-and-Prune), which discovers the top-$k$ FDs ranked by redundancy count. Redundancy count measures how much duplicated information an FD explains and connects directly to storage overhead and update anomalies. SDP uses an upper bound on redundancy to prune the search space. It is proved that this upper bound is monotone: adding attributes refines partitions and thus decreases the bound. Once the bound falls below the top-$k$ threshold, the entire branch can be skipped. We improve SDP with three optimizations: ordering attributes by partition cardinality, using pairwise statistics in a Partition Cardinality Matrix to tighten bounds, and a global scheduler to explore promising branches first. Experiments on over 40 datasets show that SDP is much faster and uses less memory than exhaustive methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing methods mainly rely on spatio-temporal interaction paradigms, where the sequential execution of multi-round dialogues incurs high latency and computation. Motivated by the recent insights that evaluation and debate mechanisms can improve problem-solving in multi-agent systems, we propose TopoDIM, a framework for one-shot Topology generation with Diverse Interaction Modes. Designed for decentralized execution to enhance adaptability and privacy, TopoDIM enables agents to autonomously construct heterogeneous communication without iterative coordination, achieving token efficiency and improved task performance. Experiments demonstrate that TopoDIM reduces total token consumption by 46.41% while improving average performance by 1.50% over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework exhibits strong adaptability in organizing communication among heterogeneous agents.

On average, participants destroyed 36% of the earnings of those who relied exclusively on the model, with punishment increasing monotonically with actual LLM use. Disclosure about LLM use created a credibility gap: self-reported null use was punished more harshly than actual null use, suggesting that declarations of \"no use\" are treated with suspicion.

This study examines the potential of quantum-assisted federated learning, which could cut the number of parameters in classical models by polylogarithmic factors and thus lessen training overhead. Accordingly, we introduce QFed, a quantum-enabled federated learning framework aimed at boosting computational efficiency across edge device networks.

For this, LLMs can be extended with tools, which are often defined in advance, also allowing for some fine-tuning for specific use cases. However, rapidly evolving software landscapes and individual services require the constant development and integration of new tools. Domain- or company-specific tools can greatly elevate the usefulness of an LLM, but such custom tools can be problematic to integrate, or the LLM may fail to reliably understand and use them. For this, we need strategies to define new tools and integrate them into the LLM dynamically, as well as robust and scalable zero-shot prompting methods that can make use of those tools in an efficient manner. In this paper, we present SAGE, a specialized conversational AI interface, based on the OPACA framework for tool discovery and execution. The integration with OPACA makes it easy to add new tools or services for the LLM to use, while SAGE itself presents rich extensibility and modularity. This not only provides the ability to seamlessly switch between different models (e.g. GPT, LLAMA), but also to add and select prompting methods, involving various setups of differently prompted agents for selecting and executing tools and evaluating the results. We implemented a number of task-solving strategies, making use of agentic concepts and prompting methods in various degrees of complexity, and evaluated those against a comprehensive set of benchmark services. The results are promising and highlight the distinct strengths and weaknesses of different task-solving strategies. Both SAGE and the OPACA framework, as well as the different benchmark services and results, are available as Open Source/Open Data on GitHub.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While interactive approaches introduce additional overhead, hybrid approaches depend on external components, which limit their scalability. A non-interactive, end-to-end framework enables reasoning to emerge within the model itself -- improving generalization while preserving analyzability without any external resources. In this work, we introduce a non-interactive, end-to-end framework for reasoning tasks. We show that introducing structural information into the few-shot prompt activates a subset of attention heads that patterns aligned with logical reasoning operators. Building on this insight, we propose Attention-Aware Intervention (AAI), an inference-time intervention method that reweights attention scores across selected heads identified by their logical patterns. AAI offers an efficient way to steer the model's reasoning toward leveraging prior knowledge through attention modulation. Extensive experiments show that AAI enhances logical reasoning performance across diverse benchmarks and model architectures, while incurring negligible additional computational overhead.

Existing multi-hop UAV networks employ a single routing path by selecting the next-hop forwarding node in a hop-by-hop manner, which leads to local congestion and increases traffic delays. In this paper, a novel traffic-adaptive multipath routing method is proposed for multi-hop UAV networks, which enables each UAV to dynamically split and forward traffic flows across multiple next-hop neighbors, thus meeting latency requirements of diverse traffic flows in dynamic mobile environments. An on-time packet delivery ratio maximization problem is formulated to determine the traffic splitting ratios at each hop. This sequential decision-making problem is modeled as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). To solve this Dec-POMDP, a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement leaning (MADRL) algorithm, termed Independent Proximal Policy Optimization with Dirichlet Modeling (IPPO-DM), is developed. Specifically, the IPPO serves as the core optimization framework, where the Dirichlet distribution is leveraged to parameterize a continuous stochastic policy network on the probability simplex, inherently ensuring feasible traffic splitting ratios. Simulation results demonstrate that IPPO-DM outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of both delivery latency guarantee and packet loss performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Inducing models to think for longer can increase their accuracy, but as the length of reasoning is further extended, it has also been shown to result in accuracy degradation and model instability. This work presents a novel sequential test-time scaling method, Min-Seek, which improves model accuracy significantly over a wide range of induced thoughts, stabilizing the accuracy of sequential scaling, and removing the need for reasoning length fine-tuning. Beyond improving model accuracy over a variety of reasoning tasks, our method is inherently efficient, as only the KV pairs of one additional induced thought are kept in the KV cache during reasoning. With a custom KV cache which stores keys without position embeddings, by dynamically encoding them contiguously before each new generated thought, our method can continue to reason well beyond a model's maximum context length, and under mild conditions has linear computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Min-Seek\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u4fdd\u7559\u4e00\u4e2a\u989d\u5916\u8bf1\u5bfc\u601d\u7ef4\u7684KV\u5bf9\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5e8f\u5217\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u968f\u7740\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u8c03\u4f18\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "method": "Min-Seek\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53ea\u4fdd\u7559\u4e00\u4e2a\u989d\u5916\u8bf1\u5bfc\u601d\u7ef4\u7684KV\u5bf9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u7f16\u7801\u952e\u503c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8d8a\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u5927\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "Min-Seek\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u5bbd\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u8bf1\u5bfc\u601d\u7ef4\u4e2d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "Min-Seek\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8d85\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u5927\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Most existing approaches primarily optimize task performance and inference cost, and explicitly or implicitly assume sequential execution, making them less optimal for controlling latency under parallel execution. In this work, we investigate learning-based orchestration of multi-agent systems with explicit latency supervision under parallel execution. We propose Latency-Aware Multi-agent System (LAMaS), a latency-aware multi-agent orchestration framework that enables parallel execution and explicitly optimizes the critical execution path, allowing the controller to construct execution topology graphs with lower latency under parallel execution. Our experiments show that our approach reduces critical path length by 38-46% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline for multi-agent architecture search across multiple benchmarks, while maintaining or even improving task performance. These results highlight the importance of explicitly optimizing latency under parallel execution when designing efficient multi-agent systems.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes RAFT, a framework for requirements auto-formalization and compliance test generation via explicating tacit regulatory knowledge from multiple LLMs. RAFT employs an Adaptive Purification-Aggregation strategy to explicate tacit regulatory knowledge from multiple LLMs and integrate it into three artifacts: a domain meta-model, a formal requirements representation, and testability constraints. These artifacts are then dynamically injected into prompts to guide high-precision requirement formalization and automated test generation.

On the other hand, anthropomorphisation raises ethical concerns, including deception, overreliance, and exploitative relationship framing, while some authors argue that anthropomorphic interaction may support autonomy, well-being, and inclusion. Despite increasing interest in the phenomenon, literature remains fragmented across domains and varies substantially in how it defines, operationalizes, and normatively evaluates anthropomorphisation. This scoping review maps ethically oriented work on anthropomorphising LLM-based CAs across five databases and three preprint repositories. We synthesize (1) conceptual foundations, (2) ethical challenges and opportunities, and (3) methodological approaches. We find convergence on attribution-based definitions but substantial divergence in operationalization, a predominantly risk-forward normative framing, and limited empirical work that links observed interaction effects to actionable governance guidance.

We introduce a new fairness objective, procedural fairness, which provides equal decision-making power for all agents, lies in the core, and provides for proportionality in outcomes. Empirical results confirm that fairness notions based on optimizing for outcomes sacrifice equal voice and representation, while the sacrifice in outcome-based fairness objectives (like equality and utilitarianism) is minimal under procedurally fair policies. We further prove that different fairness notions prioritize fundamentally different and incompatible values, highlighting that fairness requires explicit normative choices.

Since its introduction in the human-AI interaction literature, it has gained traction by generalizing the reliance paradigm and by offering a more practical alternative to the contested construct of 'trust in AI.' Yet complementarity faces key theoretical challenges: it lacks precise theoretical anchoring, it is formalized just as a post hoc indicator of relative predictive accuracy, it remains silent about other desiderata of human-AI interactions and it abstracts away from the magnitude-cost profile of its performance gain. As a result, complementarity is difficult to obtain in empirical settings. In this work, we leverage epistemology to address these challenges by reframing complementarity within the discourse on justificatory AI. Drawing on computational reliabilism, we argue that historical instances of complementarity function as evidence that a given human-AI interaction is a reliable epistemic process for a given predictive task. Together with other reliability indicators assessing the alignment of the human-AI team with the epistemic standards and socio-technical practices, complementarity contributes to the degree of reliability of human-AI teams when generating predictions. This supports the practical reasoning of those affected by these outputs -- patients, managers, regulators, and others. In summary, our approach suggests that the role and value of complementarity lies not in providing a relative measure of predictive accuracy, but in helping calibrate decision-making to the reliability of AI-supported processes that increasingly shape everyday life.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Adhering to these conventions improves maintainability, understandability, and extensibility. Additionally, following best practices during software development enhances performance and reduces the likelihood of errors. This paper analyzes 1,036 popular open-source JAVA projects on GITHUB to study how code style and programming practices are adopted and evolve over time, examining their prevalence and the most common violations. Additionally, we study a subset of active repositories on a monthly basis to track changes in adherence to coding standards over time. We found widespread violations across repositories, with Javadoc and Naming violations being the most common. We also found a significant number of violations of the GOOGLE Java Style Guide in categories often missed by modern static analysis tools. Furthermore, repositories claiming to follow code-style practices exhibited slightly higher overall adherence to code-style and best-practices. The results provide valuable insights into the adoption of code style and programming practices, highlighting key areas for improvement in the open-source development community. Furthermore, the paper identifies important lessons learned and suggests future directions for improving code quality in JAVA projects.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Such workflow-driven designs are essentially rule-based decision trees, which suffer from two fundamental limitations: they require substantial manual effort to anticipate and encode possible task states, and they cannot exhaustively cover the state space of complex real-world tasks. To address these issues, we propose an Information-Flow-Orchestrated Multi-Agent Paradigm via Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication from CORAL, in which a dedicated information flow orchestrator continuously monitors task progress and dynamically coordinates other agents through the A2A toolkit using natural language, without relying on predefined workflows. We evaluate our approach on the general-purpose benchmark GAIA, using the representative workflow-based MAS OWL as the baseline while controlling for agent roles and underlying models. Under the pass@1 setting, our method achieves 63.64% accuracy, outperforming OWL's 55.15% by 8.49 percentage points with comparable token consumption. Further case-level analysis shows that our paradigm enables more flexible task monitoring and more robust handling of edge cases.

However, most of the existing methods involve only in-distribution explanation, and do not generalize outside the training support, which requires the learning capability of generalization. In this work, we aim to provide a framework to explain black-box models for time series data through the dual lenses of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and causality. We show that many current explanation methods are sensitive to distributional shifts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Building on the concept of Sparse Autoencoder, we introduce TimeSAE, a framework for black-box model explanation. We conduct extensive evaluations of TimeSAE on both synthetic and real-world time series datasets, comparing it to leading baselines. The results, supported by both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights, show that TimeSAE provides more faithful and robust explanations.

Although large language models (LLMs) are expressive, they struggle with precise multi-objective control and numeric reasoning without external structure and feedback. We introduce \\textbf{M olGen}, a fragment-level, retrieval-augmented, two-stage framework for molecule generation under multi-property constraints. Stage I : Prototype generation: a multi-agent reasoner performs retrieval-anchored, fragment-level edits to produce a candidate near the feasible region. Stage II : RL-based fine-grained optimization: a fragment-level optimizer trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) applies one- or multi-hop refinements to explicitly minimize the property errors toward our target while regulating edit complexity and deviation from the prototype. A large, automatically curated dataset with reasoning chains of fragment edits and measured property deltas underpins both stages, enabling deterministic, reproducible supervision and controllable multi-hop reasoning. Unlike prior work, our framework better reasons about molecules by leveraging fragments and supports controllable refinement toward numeric targets.

Fun activities can activate students and, if well designed, can also help remember and reflect on abstract software development concepts. We present a novel catalogue of ten physical fun activities, developed over years to reflect on basic programming and software development concepts. The catalogue includes the execution of a LA-OLA algorithm as in stadiums, using paper planes to simulate object messages and pointers, and traversing a lecture hall as a tree or a recursive structure. We report our experience of using the activities in a large course with 500+ students three years in a row. We also conducted an interview study with 15 former students of the course and 14 experienced educators from around the globe. The results suggest that the fun activities can enable students to stay focused, remember key concepts, and reflect afterwards.

Rather than disclosing implementation specifics, we specify the architectural requirements CMA imposes and show consistent behavioral advantages on tasks that expose RAG's structural inability to accumulate, mutate, or disambiguate memory.

Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities for supporting various software engineering activities, but their use for detecting code smells remains underexplored. However, unlike the rigid rules of static analysis tools, LLMs can support flexible and adaptable detection strategies tailored to the unique properties of code smells. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of four LLMs -- DeepSeek-R1, GPT-5 mini, Llama-3.3, and Qwen2.5-Code -- for detecting nine code smells across 30 Java projects. For the empirical evaluation, we created a ground-truth dataset by asking 76 developers to manually inspect 268 code-smell candidates. Our results indicate that LLMs perform strongly for structurally straightforward smells, such as Large Class and Long Method. However, we also observed that different LLMs and tools fare better for distinct code smells. We then propose and evaluate a detection strategy that combines LLMs and static analysis tools. The proposed strategy outperforms LLMs and tools in five out of nine code smells in terms of F1-Score. However, it also generates more false positives for complex smells. Therefore, we conclude that the optimal strategy depends on whether Recall or Precision is the main priority for code smell detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We present a simple, generalizable two-stage workflow: an LLM applies a human-designed, LLM-adapted codebook; a secondary LLM critic performs self-reflection on each positive label by re-reading the source text alongside the first model's rationale and issuing a final decision. We evaluate this approach on six qualitative codes over 3,000 high-content emails from Apache Software Foundation project evaluation discussions. Our human-derived audit of 360 positive annotations (60 passages by six codes) found that the first-line LLM had a false-positive rate of 8% to 54%, despite F1 scores of 0.74 and 1.00 in testing. Subsequent recoding of all stage-one annotations via a second self-reflection stage improved F1 by 0.04 to 0.25, bringing two especially poor performing codes up to 0.69 and 0.79 from 0.52 and 0.55 respectively. Our manual evaluation identified two recurrent error classes: misinterpretation (violations of code definitions) and meta-discussion (debate about a project evaluation criterion mistaken for its use as a decision justification). Code-specific critic clauses addressing observed failure modes were especially effective with testing and refinement, replicating the codebook-adaption process for LLM interpretation in stage-one. We explain how favoring recall in first-line LLM annotation combined with secondary critique delivers precision-first, compute-light control. With human guidance and validation, self-reflection slots into existing LLM-assisted annotation pipelines to reduce noise and potentially salvage unusable classifiers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) hybrid testing tools do not fully exploit the capabilities of symbolic execution and sampling in two key aspects. First, the SOTA hybrid testing tools employ tailored symbolic execution engines that tend to over-prune branches, leading to considerable time wasted waiting for seeds from the fuzzer and missing opportunities to discover crashes. Second, existing methods do not apply sampling to the appropriate branches and therefore cannot utilize the full capability of sampling. To address these two limitations, we propose a novel hybrid testing architecture that combines the precision of conventional symbolic execution with the scalability of tailored symbolic execution engines. Based on this architecture, we propose several principles for combining fuzzing, symbolic execution, and sampling. We implement our method in a hybrid testing tool S$^2$F. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on 15 real-world programs. Experimental results demonstrate that S$^2$F outperforms the SOTA tool, achieving an average improvement of 6.14% in edge coverage and 32.6% in discovered crashes. Notably, our tool uncovers three previously unknown crashes in real-world programs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although many definitions of fairness exist, we focus on path-specific causal fairness, which allows us to better consider the social and medical contexts in which biases occur (e.g., direct discrimination by a clinician or model versus bias due to differential access to the healthcare system) and to characterize how these biases may appear in learned models. In this work, we map the structural fairness model to the observational healthcare setting and create a generalizable pipeline for training causally fair models. The pipeline explicitly considers specific healthcare context and disparities to define a target \"fair\" model. Our work fills two major gaps: first, we expand on characterizations of the \"fairness-accuracy\" tradeoff by detangling direct and indirect sources of bias and jointly presenting these fairness considerations alongside considerations of accuracy in the context of broadly known biases. Second, we demonstrate how a foundation model trained without fairness constraints on observational health data can be leveraged to generate causally fair downstream predictions in tasks with known social and medical disparities.

We propose an integrated framework combining GPTQ-based quantization, low-rank adaptation (LoRA), and a specialized data distillation process to significantly reduce model size and complexity while preserving or enhancing task-specific performance. By leveraging data distillation, knowledge distillation via Kullback-Leibler divergence, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and the Muon optimizer, our pipeline achieves up to 2x memory compression (e.g., reducing a 6GB model to 3GB) and enables efficient inference for specialized tasks.

Moreover, these methods suffer from a stark accuracy-efficiency trade-off: high performance demands excessive computation, while fast variants compromise quality.

Instead of leaving decomposition to chance, we apply three clear strategies, entity-wise, hierarchical, and atomic sequential, to encourage diverse reasoning.

To address this challenge, researchers are increasingly utilizing Machine Learning approaches to identify malware through behavioral (i.e. dynamic) cues. However, current approaches are limited by their reliance on large labeled datasets, fixed model training, and the assumption that a trained model remains effective over time-disregarding the ever-evolving sophistication of malware. As a result, they often fail to detect evolving malware attacks that adapt over time. This paper proposes an online learning approach for dynamic malware detection, that overcomes these limitations by incorporating temporal information to continuously update its models using behavioral features, specifically process resource utilization metrics. By doing so, the proposed models can incrementally adapt to emerging threats and detect zero-day malware effectively. Upon evaluating our approach against traditional batch algorithms, we find it effective in detecting zero-day malware.

We present a framework that models LLM personality via Jungian psychological types, integrating three mechanisms: a dominant-auxiliary coordination mechanism for coherent core expression, a reinforcement-compensation mechanism for temporary adaptation to context, and a reflection mechanism that drives long-term personality evolution. This design allows the agent to maintain nuanced traits while dynamically adjusting to interaction demands and gradually updating its underlying structure.

Our approach optimizes perturbation distributions at a sparse set of anchor points and interpolates distributions at non-anchor locations via log-convex combinations, which provably preserve mDP. To address privacy violations caused by naive interpolation in high-dimensional spaces, we decompose the interpolation process into a sequence of one-dimensional steps and derive a corrected formulation that enforces lp-norm mDP by design.

To address this limitation, we propose PaperScout, an autonomous agent that reformulates paper search as a sequential decision-making process. Unlike static workflows, PaperScout dynamically decides whether, when, and how to invoke search and expand tools based on accumulated retrieval context. However, training such agents presents a fundamental challenge: standard reinforcement learning methods, typically designed for single-turn tasks, suffer from a granularity mismatch when applied to multi-turn agentic tasks, where token-level optimization diverges from the granularity of sequence-level interactions, leading to noisy credit assignment. We introduce Proximal Sequence Policy Optimization (PSPO), a process-aware, sequence-level policy optimization method that aligns optimization with agent-environment interaction. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that PaperScout significantly outperforms strong workflow-driven and RL baselines in both recall and relevance, validating the effectiveness of our adaptive agentic framework and optimization strategy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Discrete tokenizations (raw values, patches, finite differences) can be brittle in low signal-to-noise regimes, especially when downstream objectives impose asymmetric penalties that rationally encourage abstention. We introduce Kinematic Tokenization, an optimization-based continuous-time representation that reconstructs an explicit spline from noisy measurements and tokenizes local spline coefficients (position, velocity, acceleration, jerk). This is applied to financial time series data in the form of asset prices in conjunction with trading volume profiles. Across a multi-asset daily-equity testbed, we use a risk-averse asymmetric classification objective as a stress test for learnability. Under this objective, several discrete baselines collapse to an absorbing cash policy (the Liquidation Equilibrium), whereas the continuous spline tokens sustain calibrated, non-trivial action distributions and stable policies. These results suggest that explicit continuous-time tokens can improve the learnability and calibration of selective decision policies in noisy time series under abstention-inducing losses.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Traditional numerical methods exhibit several inherent limitations, prompting Deep Learning (DL) as a promising alternative. The effectiveness of current DL techniques typically depends on the availability of high-quantity and high-accuracy datasets, which are yet difficult to obtain in large deformation problems. During the dataset construction process, a dilemma stands between data quantity and data accuracy, leading to suboptimal performance in the DL models. To address this challenge, we focus on a representative application of large deformations, the stretch bending problem, and propose FilDeep, a Fidelity-based Deep Learning framework for large Deformation of elastic-plastic solids. Our FilDeep aims to resolve the quantity-accuracy dilemma by simultaneously training with both low-fidelity and high-fidelity data, where the former provides greater quantity but lower accuracy, while the latter offers higher accuracy but in less quantity. In FilDeep, we provide meticulous designs for the practical large deformation problem. Particularly, we propose attention-enabled cross-fidelity modules to effectively capture long-range physical interactions across MF data. To the best of our knowledge, our FilDeep presents the first DL framework for large deformation problems using MF data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FilDeep consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance and can be efficiently deployed in manufacturing.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We show, by analyzing seventy-three public data deals, that the majority of value accrues to aggregators, with documented creator royalties rounding to zero and widespread opacity of deal terms. This is not just an economic welfare concern: as data and its derivatives become economic assets, the feedback loop that sustains current learning algorithms is at risk.

Distinguishing whether an LLM prefers correct code, or a familiar incorrect version might be influenced by what it's been exposed to during training. We introduce an exposure-aware evaluation framework that quantifies how prior exposure to buggy versus fixed code influences a model's preference. Using the ManySStuBs4J benchmark, we apply Data Portraits for membership testing on the Stack-V2 corpus to estimate whether each buggy and fixed variant was seen during training. We then stratify examples by exposure and compare model preference using code completion as well as multiple likelihood-based scoring metrics We find that most examples (67%) have neither variant in the training data, and when only one is present, fixes are more frequently present than bugs. In model generations, models reproduce buggy lines far more often than fixes, with bug-exposed examples amplifying this tendency and fix-exposed examples showing only marginal improvement. In likelihood scoring, minimum and maximum token-probability metrics consistently prefer the fixed code across all conditions, indicating a stable bias toward correct fixes. In contrast, metrics like the Gini coefficient reverse preference when only the buggy variant was seen. Our results indicate that exposure can skew bug-fix evaluations and highlight the risk that LLMs may propagate memorised errors in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8003\u8651\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u66dd\u5149\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u66dd\u5149\u4f1a\u626d\u66f2\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4f20\u64ad\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8c03\u8bd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u6e90\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u9700\u8981\u533a\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u504f\u597d\u6b63\u786e\u4ee3\u7801\u8fd8\u662f\u719f\u6089\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u8fd9\u53d7\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u63a5\u89e6\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u66dd\u5149\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ManySStuBs4J\u57fa\u51c6\u548cData Portraits\u5728Stack-V2\u8bed\u6599\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6210\u5458\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u53d8\u4f53\u662f\u5426\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u88ab\u89c1\u8fc7\u3002\u6309\u66dd\u5149\u60c5\u51b5\u5206\u5c42\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7801\u8865\u5168\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6307\u6807\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u597d\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u793a\u4f8b\uff0867%\uff09\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5305\u542b\u4efb\u4f55\u53d8\u4f53\uff1b\u5f53\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d8\u4f53\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\uff0c\u4fee\u590d\u6bd4\u9519\u8bef\u66f4\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u5236\u9519\u8bef\u884c\u8fdc\u591a\u4e8e\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u66b4\u9732\u793a\u4f8b\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u8fd9\u79cd\u503e\u5411\u3002\u5728\u4f3c\u7136\u8bc4\u5206\u4e2d\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u548c\u6700\u5927\u4ee4\u724c\u6982\u7387\u6307\u6807\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u90fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u504f\u597d\u4fee\u590d\u4ee3\u7801\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u5c3c\u7cfb\u6570\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u5728\u53ea\u6709\u9519\u8bef\u53d8\u4f53\u88ab\u89c1\u8fc7\u65f6\u4f1a\u53cd\u8f6c\u504f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u66dd\u5149\u4f1a\u626d\u66f2\u9519\u8bef-\u4fee\u590d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u4f20\u64ad\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\u9700\u8003\u8651\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u66dd\u5149\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}}

The modular framework enables adaptation of any model and supports community contributions. We demonstrate the utility of the platform in a clinical use case through comparative evaluation of lung segmentation models. To further strengthen transparency and reproducibility, we publicly release the generated segmentations and evaluation metrics and provide interactive dashboards that allow readers to inspect individual cases and reproduce or extend our analysis.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, it still falls short on logical reasoning tasks that rely on symbolic expressions and strict deductive rules. Neuro-symbolic methods address this gap by enforcing formal correctness through external solvers. Yet these solvers are highly format-sensitive, and small instabilities in model outputs can lead to frequent processing failures. LLM-driven approaches avoid parsing brittleness, but they lack structured representations and process-level error-correction mechanisms. To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we propose MatrixCoT, a structured CoT framework with a matrix-based plan. Specifically, we normalize and type natural language expressions, attach explicit citation fields, and introduce a matrix-based planning method to preserve global relations among steps. The plan becomes a verifiable artifact, making execution more stable. For verification, we also add a feedback-driven replanning mechanism. Under semantic-equivalence constraints, it identifies omissions and defects, rewrites and compresses the dependency matrix, and produces a more trustworthy final answer. Experiments on five logical-reasoning benchmarks and five LLMs show that, without relying on external solvers, MatrixCoT enhances both robustness and interpretability when tackling complex symbolic reasoning tasks, while maintaining competitive performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we propose a novel theoretical insight: a student can outperform its teacher if its advantage on a Student-Favored Subdomain (SFS) outweighs its deficit on the Teacher-Favored Subdomain (TFS). Guided by this insight, we propose Scheduled Checkpoint Distillation (SCD), which reduces the TFS deficit by emulating the teacher's convergence process during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the domain task, and a sample-wise Adaptive Weighting (AW) mechanism to preserve student strengths on SFS.

Modern ANNS engines accelerate this process using prebuilt indexes and store compressed vector-quantized representations in fast memory. However, they still rely on a costly second-pass refinement stage that reads full-precision vectors from slower storage like SSDs. For modern text and multimodal embeddings, these reads now dominate the latency of the entire query. We propose FaTRQ, a far-memory-aware refinement system using tiered memory that eliminates the need to fetch full vectors from storage. It introduces a progressive distance estimator that refines coarse scores using compact residuals streamed from far memory. Refinement stops early once a candidate is provably outside the top-k.

Unlike standard transformers that process representations through fixed discrete layers, our approach treats depth as a continuous variable governed by a learned vector field $F_\u03b8(H, \u03c4, u)$, where $u$ is a low-dimensional control signal injected via explicit concatenation. We validate the architecture through four experiments: (1) gradient flow stability with zero exploding/vanishing gradient events, (2) semantic steering achieving 98\\%/88\\% accuracy for positive/negative sentiment control, (3) continuous interpolation validated by a negligible 0.068\\% trajectory divergence between fixed and adaptive solvers, and (4) efficiency benchmarking demonstrating latency parity with standard discrete baselines. Additionally, we show that adaptive ODE solvers reveal geometric structure in the learned dynamics: the control signal partitions the vector field into distinct dynamical regimes with different curvature characteristics. The adjoint method enables $O(1)$ memory training regardless of integration depth. Our results demonstrate that continuous-depth dynamics with learned control signals provide a viable, efficient mechanism for steerable language generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Yet, their ability to infer temporal regularities from structured behavioral data remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic study investigating whether LLMs can predict time intervals between recurring user actions, such as repeated purchases, and how different levels of contextual information shape their predictive behavior. Using a simple but representative repurchase scenario, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs in zero-shot settings against both statistical and machine-learning models. Two key findings emerge. First, while LLMs surpass lightweight statistical baselines, they consistently underperform dedicated machine-learning models, showing their limited ability to capture quantitative temporal structure. Second, although moderate context can improve LLM accuracy, adding further user-level detail degrades performance. These results challenge the assumption that \"more context leads to better reasoning\".

Standard multimodal pipelines learn a single shared embedding across all modalities. In DFL, such a monolithic representation induces gradient misalignment between uni- and multimodal agents; as a result, it suppresses heterogeneous sharing and cross-modal interaction. We present PARSE, a multimodal DFL framework that operationalizes partial information decomposition (PID) in a server-free setting. Each agent performs feature fission to factorize its latent representation into redundant, unique, and synergistic slices. P2P knowledge sharing among heterogeneous agents is enabled by slice-level partial alignment: only semantically shareable branches are exchanged among agents that possess the corresponding modality. By removing the need for central coordination and gradient surgery, PARSE resolves uni-/multimodal gradient conflicts, thereby overcoming the multimodal DFL dilemma while remaining compatible with standard DFL constraints. Across benchmarks and agent mixes, PARSE yields consistent gains over task-, modality-, and hybrid-sharing DFL baselines.

Models trained on static historical data often overfit, resulting in poor generalization in dynamic markets. The mantra \"History Is Not Enough\" underscores the need for adaptive data generation that learns to evolve with the market rather than relying solely on past observations. We present a drift-aware dataflow system that integrates machine learning-based adaptive control into the data curation process. The system couples a parameterized data manipulation module comprising single-stock transformations, multi-stock mix-ups, and curation operations, with an adaptive planner-scheduler that employs gradient-based bi-level optimization to control the system.

However, existing PFL methods produce static models with a fixed tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency, limiting their applicability in environments where inference requirements vary with contexts and resource availability. Early-exit networks (EENs) offer adaptive inference by attaching intermediate classifiers. Yet integrating them into PFL is challenging due to client-wise heterogeneity and depth-wise interference arising from conflicting exit objectives. Prior studies fail to resolve both conflicts simultaneously, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose CAFEDistill, a Conflict-Aware Federated Exit Distillation framework that jointly addresses these conflicts and extends PFL to early-exit networks. Through a progressive, depth-prioritized student coordination mechanism, CAFEDistill mitigates interference among shallow and deep exits while allowing effective personalized knowledge transfer across clients. Furthermore, it reduces communication overhead via a client-decoupled formulation. Extensive evaluations show that CAFEDistill outperforms the state-of-the-arts, achieving higher accuracy and reducing inference costs by 30.79%-46.86%.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The Decision Transformer (DT) introduced a powerful paradigm by framing RL as an autoregressive sequence modeling problem. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning and planning tasks. This inspires us whether LLMs, which share the same Transformer foundation, but operate at a much larger scale, can unlock new levels of performance in long-horizon sequential decision-making problem. This work investigates the application of LLMs to offline decision making tasks. A fundamental challenge in this domain is the LLMs' inherent inability to interpret continuous values, as they lack a native understanding of numerical magnitude and order when values are represented as text strings. To address this, we propose treating trajectories as a distinct modality. By learning to align trajectory data with natural language task descriptions, our model can autoregressively predict future decisions within a cohesive framework we term DecisionLLM. We establish a set of scaling laws governing this paradigm, demonstrating that performance hinges on three factors: model scale, data volume, and data quality. In offline experimental benchmarks and bidding scenarios, DecisionLLM achieves strong performance. Specifically, DecisionLLM-3B outperforms the traditional Decision Transformer (DT) by 69.4 on Maze2D umaze-v1 and by 0.085 on AuctionNet.

This paper compares a strong time-aware target encoding baseline to models augmented with entity history time aggregation under several window designs.

Within the time aggregation design grid, event count windows provide the only consistent improvement over trailing windows, and the gain is small.

Traditional static ensemble methods, such as Stacking, typically assign weights by treating each base learner as a holistic entity, thereby overlooking the fact that individual models exhibit varying degrees of competence across different regions of the instance space. To address this limitation, Dynamic Ensemble Selection (DES) was introduced. However, both static and dynamic approaches predominantly rely on the divergence among different models as the basis for integration. This inter-model perspective neglects the intrinsic characteristics of the models themselves and necessitates a heavy reliance on validation sets for competence estimation. In this paper, we propose the Behavioral Profiling Ensemble (BPE) framework, which introduces a novel paradigm shift. Unlike traditional methods, BPE constructs a ``behavioral profile'' intrinsic to each model and derives integration weights based on the deviation between the model's response to a specific test instance and its established behavioral profile. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the algorithm derived from the BPE framework achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art ensemble baselines.

Meanwhile, there exist vast and continuously growing amounts of unlabeled data that may be closely related to the ICL task. How to utilize such unlabeled data to provably enhance the performance of ICL thus becomes an emerging fundamental question. In this work, we propose a novel augmented ICL framework, in which the prompt includes a small set of labeled examples alongside a block of unlabeled inputs. We focus on the multi-class linear classification setting and demonstrate that, with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, a multi-layer transformer can effectively emulate an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. This enables the transformer to implicitly extract useful information from both labeled and unlabeled data, leading to provable improvements in ICL accuracy.

However, ensuring the effectiveness of CRSs requires large-scale and even continuous model training to accommodate diverse user preferences, resulting in significant computational costs and resource demands. A promising approach to this challenge is coreset selection, which identifies a small but representative subset of data samples that preserves model quality while reducing training overhead. Yet, the selected coreset is vulnerable to the pervasive noise in user-item interactions, particularly when it is minimally sized. To this end, we propose Noise-aware Coreset Selection (NaCS), a specialized framework for CRSs. NaCS constructs coresets through submodular optimization based on training gradients, while simultaneously correcting noisy labels using a progressively trained model. Meanwhile, we refine the selected coreset by filtering out low-confidence samples through uncertainty quantification, thereby avoid training with unreliable interactions. Through extensive experiments, we show that NaCS produces higher-quality coresets for CRSs while achieving better efficiency than existing coreset selection techniques.

This study presents a workflow for systematically evaluating information loss caused by downsampling in high-frequency time series. The workflow combines shape-based distortion metrics with classification outcomes from available feature-based machine learning models and feature space analysis to quantify how different downsampling algorithms and factors affect both waveform integrity and predictive performance. We use a three-class NMD classification task to experimentally evaluate the workflow. We demonstrate how the workflow identifies downsampling configurations that preserve diagnostic information while substantially reducing computational load. Analysis of shape-based distortion metrics showed that shape-aware downsampling algorithms outperform standard decimation, as they better preserve peak structure and overall signal morphology.

The HuSHeM model demonstrated higher discriminative performance, as reflected by an increased area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with relatively narrow confidence intervals compared to WHO(+SIRI).

While existing KV compression techniques offer a remedy for inference, directly applying them to RL training induces a severe policy mismatch, leading to catastrophic performance collapse. To address this, we introduce Sparse-RL empowers stable RL training under sparse rollouts. We show that instability arises from a fundamental policy mismatch among the dense old policy, the sparse sampler policy, and the learner policy. To mitigate this issue, Sparse-RL incorporates Sparsity-Aware Rejection Sampling and Importance-based Reweighting to correct the off-policy bias introduced by compression-induced information loss.

Our benchmark comprises 2,500 trivial geometric problems spanning 25 categories, each carefully crafted to be solvable purely through native geometric understanding, assuming known object locations. We assess a range of state-of-the-art models on NoReGeo, including frontier models like GPT-4, observing that even the most advanced systems achieve an overall maximum of 65% accuracy in binary classification tasks. Further, our ablation experiments demonstrate that such geometric understanding does not emerge through fine-tuning alone, indicating that effective training for geometric comprehension requires a specialized approach from the outset.

However, it has the potential to substantially degrade safety alignment, e.g., by greatly increasing susceptibility to jailbreak attacks, even when the fine-tuning data is entirely harmless. Despite garnering growing attention in defense efforts during the fine-tuning stage, existing methods struggle with a persistent safety-utility dilemma: emphasizing safety compromises task performance, whereas prioritizing utility typically requires deep fine-tuning that inevitably leads to steep safety declination.\n  In this work, we address this dilemma by shedding new light on the geometric interaction between safety- and utility-oriented gradients in safety-aligned LLMs. Through systematic empirical analysis, we uncover three key insights: (I) safety gradients lie in a low-rank subspace, while utility gradients span a broader high-dimensional space; (II) these subspaces are often negatively correlated, causing directional conflicts during fine-tuning; and (III) the dominant safety direction can be efficiently estimated from a single sample. Building upon these novel insights, we propose safety-preserving fine-tuning (SPF), a lightweight approach that explicitly removes gradient components conflicting with the low-rank safety subspace. Theoretically, we show that SPF guarantees utility convergence while bounding safety drift.

Furthermore, SPF exhibits robust resistance to both deep fine-tuning and dynamic jailbreak attacks.

To address this issue, we propose ErrEval, a flexible and Error-aware Evaluation framework that enhances QG evaluation through explicit error diagnostics. Specifically, ErrEval reformulates evaluation as a two-stage process of error diagnosis followed by informed scoring. At the first stage, a lightweight plug-and-play Error Identifier detects and categorizes common errors across structural, linguistic, and content-related aspects. These diagnostic signals are then incorporated as explicit evidence to guide LLM evaluators toward more fine-grained and grounded judgments. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ErrEval, showing that incorporating explicit diagnostics improves alignment with human judgments. Further analyses confirm that ErrEval effectively mitigates the overestimation of low-quality questions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose LOOKAT, which applies product quantization and asymmetric distance computation, to transformer architecture by decomposing key vectors into subspaces, learning codebooks and computing attention tables via lookup tables. This transforms attention from memory-bound to compute-bound.

Privacy policies are often difficult for people to fully comprehend due to the lengthy and complex legal language used and inconsistent practices across different sectors and organisations. To help conduct automated and large-scale analyses of privacy policies, many researchers have studied applications of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, including large language models (LLMs). While a limited number of prior studies utilised LLMs for extracting personal data flows from privacy policies, our approach builds on this line of work by combining LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a customised knowledge base derived from existing studies. This paper presents the development of LADFA, an end-to-end computational framework, which can process unstructured text in a given privacy policy, extract personal data flows and construct a personal data flow graph, and conduct analysis of the data flow graph to facilitate insight discovery. The framework consists of a pre-processor, an LLM-based processor, and a data flow post-processor. We demonstrated and validated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach by conducting a case study that involved examining ten selected privacy policies from the automotive industry. Moreover, it is worth noting that LADFA is designed to be flexible and customisable, making it suitable for a range of text-based analysis tasks beyond privacy policy analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While test-time alignment offers a promising alternative, existing approaches often rely on distorted trajectory-level signals or inefficient sampling, fundamentally capping performance and failing to preserve the generative diversity of the base model. This paper introduces LLMdoctor, a novel framework for efficient test-time alignment that operates via a patient-doctor paradigm. It integrates token-level reward acquisition with token-level flow-guided preference optimization (TFPO) to steer a large, frozen patient LLM with a smaller, specialized doctor model. Unlike conventional methods that rely on trajectory-level rewards, LLMdoctor first extracts fine-grained, token-level preference signals from the patient model's behavioral variations. These signals then guide the training of the doctor model via TFPO, which establishes flow consistency across all subtrajectories, enabling precise token-by-token alignment while inherently preserving generation diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMdoctor significantly outperforms existing test-time alignment methods and even surpasses the performance of full fine-tuning approaches like DPO.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMdoctor\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8epatient-doctor\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684token\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u51bb\u7ed3\u5927\u578bLLM\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u626d\u66f2\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\u6216\u4f4e\u6548\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u91c7\u7528patient-doctor\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u5927\u578bpatient LLM\u548c\u4e13\u95e8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5c0f\u578bdoctor\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2. \u4ecepatient\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684token\u7ea7\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b3. \u901a\u8fc7token\u7ea7\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08TFPO\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3doctor\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6240\u6709\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6d41\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9010token\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1.

Existing solutions heavily rely on model-specific interpretation techniques, which lack adaptability and generality across different model architectures and deployment scenarios.\n  In this paper, we propose BiasSeeker, the first semi-automated framework that is both model-agnostic and data-driven for detecting dataset-specific shortcut features in encrypted traffic. By performing statistical correlation analysis directly on raw binary traffic, BiasSeeker identifies spurious or environment-entangled features that may compromise generalization, independent of any classifier. To address the diverse nature of shortcut features, we introduce a systematic categorization and apply category-specific validation strategies that reduce bias while preserving meaningful information.\n  We evaluate BiasSeeker on 19 public datasets across three NTC tasks. By emphasizing context-aware feature selection and dataset-specific diagnosis, BiasSeeker offers a novel perspective for understanding and addressing shortcut learning in encrypted network traffic classification, raising awareness that feature selection should be an intentional and scenario-sensitive step prior to model training.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this problem, we present NSR-Boost, a neuro-symbolic residual boosting framework designed specifically for industrial scenarios. Its core advantage lies in being \"non-intrusive\". It treats the legacy model as a frozen model and performs targeted repairs on \"hard regions\" where predictions fail. The framework comprises three key stages: first, finding hard regions through residuals, then generating interpretable experts by generating symbolic code structures using Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning parameters using Bayesian optimization, and finally dynamically integrating experts with legacy model output through a lightweight aggregator. We report on the successful deployment of NSR-Boost within the core financial risk control system at Qfin Holdings. This framework not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines across six public datasets and one private dataset, more importantly, shows excellent performance gains on real-world online data. In conclusion, it effectively captures long-tail risks missed by traditional models and offers a safe, low-cost evolutionary paradigm for industry.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Global climate indices, such as the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, are standard input features for long-term rainfall prediction. However, a significant gap persists regarding local-scale indices capable of improving predictive accuracy in specific regions of Thailand. This paper introduces a novel NorthEast monsoon climate index calculated from sea surface temperature to reflect the climatology of the boreal winter monsoon. To optimise the calculated areas used for this index, a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent explores and selects the most effective rectangles based on their correlation with seasonal rainfall. Rainfall stations were classified into 12 distinct clusters to distinguish rainfall patterns between southern and upper Thailand. Experimental results show that incorporating the optimised index into Long Short-Term Memory models significantly improves long-term monthly rainfall prediction skill in most cluster areas. This approach effectively reduces the Root Mean Square Error for 12-month-ahead forecasts.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

For cases where the noise is not independent and identically distributed across features (i.e., the covariance is not spherical) we introduce Graph Regularized PCA (GR-PCA). It is a graph-based regularization of PCA that incorporates the dependency structure of the data features by learning a sparse precision graph and biasing loadings toward the low-frequency Fourier modes of the corresponding graph Laplacian. Consequently, high-frequency signals are suppressed, while graph-coherent low-frequency ones are preserved, yielding interpretable principal components aligned with conditional relationships. We evaluate GR-PCA on synthetic data spanning diverse graph topologies, signal-to-noise ratios, and sparsity levels. Compared to mainstream alternatives, it concentrates variance on the intended support, produces loadings with lower graph-Laplacian energy, and remains competitive in out-of-sample reconstruction. When high-frequency signals are present, the graph Laplacian penalty prevents overfitting, reducing the reconstruction accuracy but improving structural fidelity. The advantage over PCA is most pronounced when high-frequency signals are graph-correlated, whereas PCA remains competitive when such signals are nearly rotationally invariant. The procedure is simple to implement, modular with respect to the precision estimator, and scalable, providing a practical route to structure-aware dimensionality reduction that improves structural fidelity without sacrificing predictive performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Graph Regularized PCA (GR-PCA)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u878d\u5165PCA\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfPCA\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u5f80\u5f80\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fdd\u80cc\u4e86PCA\u6240\u9700\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u566a\u58f0\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u4f20\u7edfPCA\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u975e\u7403\u5f62\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "GR-PCA\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u56fe\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff1a1) \u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4f7f\u8f7d\u8377\u504f\u5411\u4f4e\u9891\u7387\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u9ad8\u9891\u7387\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b3) \u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6838\u5fc3\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff1aGR-PCA\u80fd\u5c06\u65b9\u5dee\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u9884\u671f\u652f\u6491\u4e0a\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u56fe\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u8f7d\u8377\uff1b\u5728\u6837\u672c\u5916\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff1b\u5f53\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u7387\u4fe1\u53f7\u65f6\u80fd\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff1b\u5f53\u9ad8\u9891\u7387\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b58\u5728\u56fe\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u65f6\u4f18\u52bf\u6700\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "GR-PCA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u964d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u53ef\u4e0e\u4efb\u610f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u96c6\u6210\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

But most relevant works are based on outcome rewards at the trajectory level, missing fine-grained supervision during the reasoning process. Other existing training frameworks that try to combine process signals together to optimize LLMs also rely heavily on tedious additional steps like MCTS, training a separate reward model, etc., doing harm to the training efficiency. Moreover, the intuition behind the process signals design lacks rigorous theoretical support, leaving the understanding of the optimization mechanism opaque. In this paper, we propose Process Reward Learning (PRL), which decomposes the entropy regularized reinforcement learning objective into intermediate steps, with rigorous process rewards that could be assigned to models accordingly. Starting from theoretical motivation, we derive the formulation of PRL that is essentially equivalent to the objective of reward maximization plus a KL-divergence penalty term between the policy model and a reference model. However, PRL could turn the outcome reward into process supervision signals, which helps better guide the exploration during RL optimization. From our experiment results, we demonstrate that PRL not only improves the average performance for LLMs' reasoning ability measured by average @ n, but also broadens the reasoning boundary by improving the pass @ n metric. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of PRL could be verified and generalized.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We analyze DP-SGD in the $f$-differential privacy framework, which characterizes privacy via hypothesis-testing trade-off curves, and study shuffled sampling over a single epoch with $M$ gradient updates. We derive an explicit suboptimal upper bound on the achievable trade-off curve. This result induces a geometric lower bound on the separation $\u03ba$ which is the maximum distance between the mechanism's trade-off curve and the ideal random-guessing line. Because a large separation implies significant adversarial advantage, meaningful privacy requires small $\u03ba$. However, we prove that enforcing a small separation imposes a strict lower bound on the Gaussian noise multiplier $\u03c3$, which directly limits the achievable utility. In particular, under the standard worst-case adversarial model, shuffled DP-SGD must satisfy\n  $\u03c3\\ge \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\ln M}}$ $\\quad\\text{or}\\quad$ $\u03ba\\ge\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}\\!\\left(1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\u03c0\\ln M}}\\right)$,\n  and thus cannot simultaneously achieve strong privacy and high utility. Although this bound vanishes asymptotically as $M \\to \\infty$, the convergence is extremely slow: even for practically relevant numbers of updates the required noise magnitude remains substantial. We further show that the same limitation extends to Poisson subsampling up to constant factors. Our experiments confirm that the noise levels implied by this bound leads to significant accuracy degradation at realistic training settings, thus showing a critical bottleneck in DP-SGD under standard worst-case adversarial assumptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this, we introduce and apply a multi-layered diagnostic framework to a cross-architectural study. We fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Mistral models on a high-stakes phishing detection task and use SHAP analysis and mechanistic interpretability to uncover the root causes of their generalization failures. Our investigation reveals three critical findings: (1) Generalization is driven by a powerful synergy between architecture and data diversity. The Gemma 2 9B model achieves state-of-the-art performance (>91\\% F1), but only when trained on a stylistically diverse ``generalist'' dataset. (2) Generalization is highly architecture-dependent. We diagnose a specific failure mode in Llama 3.1 8B, which performs well on a narrow domain but cannot integrate diverse data, leading to a significant performance drop. (3) Some architectures are inherently more generalizable. The Mistral model proves to be a consistent and resilient performer across multiple training paradigms.

However, during training, its optimization behavior does not always align with theoretical expectations, since both sharp and flat regions may yield a small perturbed loss. In such cases, the gradient may still point toward sharp regions, failing to achieve the intended effect of SAM. To address this issue, we investigate SAM from a spectral and geometric perspective: specifically, we utilize the angle between the gradient and the leading eigenvector of the Hessian as a measure of sharpness. Our analysis illustrates that when this angle is less than or equal to ninety degrees, the effect of SAM's sharpness regularization can be weakened.

However, whether these advances yield commensurate improvements in safety remains unclear, in part due to fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5. We evaluate each model across language, vision-language, and image generation settings using a unified protocol that integrates benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation. Aggregating our evaluations into safety leaderboards and model safety profiles across multiple evaluation modes reveals a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. While GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced safety performance across evaluations, other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation, with all models degrading substantially despite strong results on standard benchmarks. Text-to-image models achieve relatively stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain brittle under adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these results show that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation scheme, underscoring the need for standardized safety evaluations to accurately assess real-world risk and guide responsible model development and deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, recent studies show that such alignment is often shallow and remains vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms, including decoding-based constraints and post-hoc content detectors, struggle against sophisticated jailbreaks, often intervening robust detection or excessively degrading model utility. In this work, we examine the decoding process of LLMs and make a key observation: even when successfully jailbroken, models internally exhibit latent safety-related signals during generation. However, these signals are overridden by the model's drive for fluent continuation, preventing timely self-correction or refusal. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective approach that explicitly surfaces and leverages these latent safety signals for early detection of unsafe content during decoding. Experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances safety, while maintaining low over-refusal rates on benign inputs and preserving response quality. Our results suggest that activating intrinsic safety-awareness during decoding offers a promising and complementary direction for defending against jailbreak attacks.

Queries arrive according to a Poisson process, and each type occurs with a known prior probability. For each task type, the server allocates a fixed number of internal thinking tokens, which determines the computational effort devoted to that query. The token allocation induces an accuracy-latency trade-off: the service time follows an approximately affine function of the allocated tokens, while the probability of a correct response exhibits diminishing returns. Under a first-in, first-out (FIFO) service discipline, the system operates as an $M/G/1$ queue, and the mean system time depends on the first and second moments of the resulting service-time distribution. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a weighted average accuracy objective penalized by the mean system time, subject to architectural token-budget constraints and queue-stability conditions. The objective function is shown to be strictly concave over the stability region, which ensures existence and uniqueness of the optimal token allocation. The first-order optimality conditions yield a coupled projected fixed-point characterization of the optimum, together with an iterative solution and an explicit sufficient condition for contraction. Moreover, a projected gradient method with a computable global step-size bound is developed to guarantee convergence beyond the contractive regime. Finally, integer-valued token allocations are attained via rounding of the continuous solution, and the resulting performance loss is evaluated in simulation results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5355LLM\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6-\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6743\u8861\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eM/G/1\u961f\u5217\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5", "motivation": "LLM\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u9762\u5bf9\u5f02\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u6d41\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u601d\u8003\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u914d\u3002", "method": "1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u6cca\u677e\u5230\u8fbe\u548cFIFO\u670d\u52a1\u7684M/G/1\u961f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b2) \u5c06\u670d\u52a1\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5206\u914d\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u7684\u4eff\u5c04\u51fd\u6570\uff1b3) \u5efa\u7acb\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u7684\u9012\u51cf\u56de\u62a5\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b4) \u6784\u5efa\u5e26\u961f\u5217\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1b5) \u63d0\u51fa\u6295\u5f71\u5b9a\u70b9\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\uff1b6) \u901a\u8fc7\u820d\u5165\u83b7\u5f97\u6574\u6570\u5206\u914d\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "1) \u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u5185\u4e25\u683c\u51f9\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u5b58\u5728\u552f\u4e00\uff1b2) \u4e00\u9636\u6761\u4ef6\u7ed9\u51fa\u8026\u5408\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u5b9a\u70b9\u523b\u753b\uff1b3) \u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6536\u7f29\u6027\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b4) \u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u5168\u5c40\u6b65\u957f\u754c\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u6cd5\uff1b5) \u8fde\u7eed\u89e3\u7ecf\u820d\u5165\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u63a7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u7684LLM\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6574\u6570\u5316\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

By enforcing linear dynamics $dz/dt = Az$ in a learned observable space, both PIKE (without explicit sparsity) and SPIKE (with L1 regularization on $A$) learn sparse generator matrices, embodying the parsimony principle that complex dynamics admit low-dimensional structure. Experiments across parabolic, hyperbolic, dispersive, and stiff PDEs, including fluid dynamics (Navier-Stokes) and chaotic ODEs (Lorenz), demonstrate consistent improvements in temporal extrapolation, spatial generalization, and long-term prediction accuracy.

However, existing studies face challenges in domain incremental learning. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and robust dual-causal disentanglement framework (DualCD) to enhance the robustness of models under domain incremental scenarios, which can be seamlessly integrated into time series classification models. Specifically, DualCD first introduces a temporal feature disentanglement module to capture class-causal features and spurious features. The causal features can offer sufficient predictive power to support the classifier in domain incremental learning settings. To accurately capture these causal features, we further design a dual-causal intervention mechanism to eliminate the influence of both intra-class and inter-class confounding features. This mechanism constructs variant samples by combining the current class's causal features with intra-class spurious features and with causal features from other classes. The causal intervention loss encourages the model to accurately predict the labels of these variant samples based solely on the causal features. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models demonstrate that DualCD effectively improves performance in domain incremental scenarios. We summarize our rich experiments into a comprehensive benchmark to facilitate research in domain incremental time series classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A Mechanistic Analysis of Hierarchical Reasoning Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Hierarchical reasoning model (HRM) achieves extraordinary performance on various reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming large language model-based reasoners. To understand the strengths and potential failure modes of HRM, we conduct a mechanistic study on its reasoning patterns and find three surprising facts: (a) Failure of extremely simple puzzles, e.g., HRM can fail on a puzzle with only one unknown cell. We attribute this failure to the violation of the fixed point property, a fundamental assumption of HRM. (b) \"Grokking\" dynamics in reasoning steps, i.e., the answer is not improved uniformly, but instead there is a critical reasoning step that suddenly makes the answer correct; (c) Existence of multiple fixed points. HRM \"guesses\" the first fixed point, which could be incorrect, and gets trapped there for a while or forever. All facts imply that HRM appears to be \"guessing\" instead of \"reasoning\". Leveraging this \"guessing\" picture, we propose three strategies to scale HRM's guesses: data augmentation (scaling the quality of guesses), input perturbation (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging inference randomness), and model bootstrapping (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging training randomness). On the practical side, by combining all methods, we develop Augmented HRM, boosting accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme from 54.5% to 96.9%.

The core challenge lies in modeling the underlying complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Various methods have been proposed, and recent studies show that the modeling of dynamics is useful to meet the core challenge. While handling spatial dependencies and temporal dependencies using separate base model structures may hinder the modeling of spatio-temporal correlations, the modeling of dynamics can bridge this gap. Incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity also advances the main goal, since it can extend the parameter space and allow more flexibility. Despite these advances, two limitations persist: 1) the modeling of dynamics is often limited to the dynamics of spatial topology (e.g., adjacency matrix changes), which, however, can be extended to a broader scope; 2) the modeling of heterogeneity is often separated for spatial and temporal dimensions, but this gap can also be bridged by the modeling of dynamics. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for traffic prediction, called Meta Dynamic Graph (MetaDG). MetaDG leverages dynamic graph structures of node representations to explicitly model spatio-temporal dynamics. This generates both dynamic adjacency matrices and meta-parameters, extending dynamic modeling beyond topology while unifying the capture of spatio-temporal heterogeneity into a single dimension. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of MetaDG.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The approach causes fragmentation in information graphs in document structures, over-retrieval, and duplication of content alongside insufficient query context, including 2nd and 3rd order facets. In this paper, a structure-informed and diversity-constrained context bubble construction framework is proposed that assembles coherent, citable bundles of spans under a strict token budget. The method preserves and exploits inherent document structure by organising multi-granular spans (e.g., sections and rows) and using task-conditioned structural priors to guide retrieval. Starting from high-relevance anchor spans, a context bubble is constructed through constrained selection that balances query relevance, marginal coverage, and redundancy penalties. It will explicitly constrain diversity and budget, producing compact and informative context sets, unlike top-k retrieval. Moreover, a full retrieval is emitted that traces the scoring and selection choices of the records, thus providing auditability and deterministic tuning. Experiments on enterprise documents demonstrate the efficiency of context bubble as it significantly reduces redundant context, is better able to cover secondary facets and has a better answer quality and citation faithfulness within a limited context window. Ablation studies demonstrate that both structural priors as well as diversity constraint selection are necessary; removing either component results in a decline in coverage and an increase in redundant or incomplete context.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Design outcomes were evaluated by expert raters, while self-efficacy and cognitive load were self-reported after each phase. Difference-in-differences analyses revealed no overall performance advantage of GenAI across participants; however, subgroup analyses showed that GenAI significantly improved design performance for novice designers.

Time-series extrinsic regression (TSER) models increasingly leverage PPG signals to estimate clinically relevant outcomes, including heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. For clinical reasoning and trust, however, single point estimates alone are insufficient: clinicians must also understand whether predictions are stable under physiologically plausible variations and to what extent realistic, attainable changes in physiological signals would meaningfully alter a model's prediction. Counterfactual explanations (CFE) address these \"what-if\" questions, yet existing time series CFE generation methods are largely restricted to classification, overlook waveform morphology, and often produce physiologically implausible signals, limiting their applicability to continuous biomedical time series. To address these limitations, we introduce EvoMorph, a multi-objective evolutionary framework for generating physiologically plausible and diverse CFE for TSER applications. EvoMorph optimizes morphology-aware objectives defined on interpretable signal descriptors and applies transformations to preserve the waveform structure. We evaluated EvoMorph on three PPG datasets (heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) against a nearest-unlike-neighbor baseline. In addition, in a case study, we evaluated EvoMorph as a tool for uncertainty quantification by relating counterfactual sensitivity to bootstrap-ensemble uncertainty and data-density measures. Overall, EvoMorph enables the generation of physiologically-aware counterfactuals for continuous biomedical signals and supports uncertainty-aware interpretability, advancing trustworthy model analysis for clinical time-series applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

PLGC offers three key contributions: (1) A diagnosis of why supervised condensation fails under label noise and distribution shift. (2) A label-free condensation method that jointly learns latent prototypes and node assignments. (3) Theoretical guarantees showing that pseudo-labels preserve latent structural statistics of the original graph and ensure accurate embedding alignment. Empirically, across node classification and link prediction tasks, PLGC achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art supervised condensation methods on clean datasets and exhibits substantial robustness under label noise, often outperforming all baselines by a significant margin.

Existing attack strategies typically struggle against safety-constrained algorithms (e.g., CQL) due to inefficient random poisoning and the use of easily detectable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) triggers. In this paper, we propose CS-GBA (Critical Sample-based Gradient-guided Backdoor Attack), a novel framework designed to achieve high stealthiness and destructiveness under a strict budget. Leveraging the theoretical insight that samples with high Temporal Difference (TD) errors are pivotal for value function convergence, we introduce an adaptive Critical Sample Selection strategy that concentrates the attack budget on the most influential transitions. To evade OOD detection, we propose a Correlation-Breaking Trigger mechanism that exploits the physical mutual exclusivity of state features (e.g., 95th percentile boundaries) to remain statistically concealed. Furthermore, we replace the conventional label inversion with a Gradient-Guided Action Generation mechanism, which searches for worst-case actions within the data manifold using the victim Q-network's gradient. Empirical results on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving high attack success rates against representative safety-constrained algorithms with a minimal 5% poisoning budget, while maintaining the agent's performance in clean environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While it has been shown that such information can drastically boost the value, finding the optimal policy is NP-hard, and it is common to apply one of two tractable heuristics: processing the lookahead in chunks of predefined sizes ('fixed batching policies'), and model predictive control. We first illustrate the problems with these two approaches and propose utilizing the lookahead in adaptive (state-dependent) batches; we refer to such policies as adaptive batching policies (ABPs). We derive the optimal Bellman equations for these strategies and design an optimistic regret-minimizing algorithm that enables learning the optimal ABP when interacting with unknown environments.

Although many methods have been proposed to reduce communication overhead, most focus solely on compressing individual gradients, overlooking the temporal correlations among them. Prior studies have shown that gradients exhibit spatial correlations, typically reflected in low-rank structures. Through empirical analysis, we further observe a strong temporal correlation between client gradients across adjacent rounds. Based on these observations, we propose GradESTC, a compression technique that exploits both spatial and temporal gradient correlations. GradESTC exploits spatial correlations to decompose each full gradient into a compact set of basis vectors and corresponding combination coefficients. By exploiting temporal correlations, only a small portion of the basis vectors need to be dynamically updated in each round. GradESTC significantly reduces communication overhead by transmitting lightweight combination coefficients and a limited number of updated basis vectors instead of the full gradients. Extensive experiments show that, upon reaching a target accuracy level near convergence, GradESTC reduces uplink communication by an average of 39.79% compared to the strongest baseline, while maintaining comparable convergence speed and final accuracy to uncompressed FedAvg. By effectively leveraging spatio-temporal gradient structures, GradESTC offers a practical and scalable solution for communication-efficient federated learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

By training a GPT-2 model on a dataset of existing modulation formulas, new modulation schemes has been created. These generated schemes are then compared to traditional methods using key performance metrics such as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Power Spectrum Density (PSD). The results show that Transformer-generated modulation schemes can achieve performance comparable to, and in some cases outperforming, traditional methods.

The transparency of models makes it possible to discern some factors, such as security or non-discrimination. In this paper, we propose a mixture of transparent local models as an alternative solution for designing interpretable (or transparent) models. Our approach is designed for the situations where a simple and transparent function is suitable for modeling the label of instances in some localities/regions of the input space, but may change abruptly as we move from one locality to another. Consequently, the proposed algorithm is to learn both the transparent labeling function and the locality of the input space where the labeling function achieves a small risk in its assigned locality. By using a new multi-predictor (and multi-locality) loss function, we established rigorous PAC-Bayesian risk bounds for the case of binary linear classification problem and that of linear regression. In both cases, synthetic data sets were used to illustrate how the learning algorithms work. The results obtained from real data sets highlight the competitiveness of our approach compared to other existing methods as well as certain opaque models.

To address this, we propose the Process-Guided Concept Bottleneck Model (PG-CBM), an extension of CBMs which constrains learning to follow domain-defined causal mechanisms through biophysically meaningful intermediate concepts. Using above ground biomass density estimation from Earth Observation data as a case study, we show that PG-CBM reduces error and bias compared to multiple benchmarks, whilst leveraging multi-source heterogeneous training data and producing interpretable intermediate outputs.

An enhanced version was accepted for oral presentation at the AI for Time Series Analysis Workshop at AAAI 2026", "summary": "Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have emerged as a promising approach for zero-shot financial forecasting, demonstrating strong transferability and data efficiency gains. However, their adoption in financial applications is hindered by fundamental limitations in uncertainty quantification: current approaches either rely on restrictive distributional assumptions, conflate different sources of uncertainty, or lack principled calibration mechanisms. While recent TSFMs employ sophisticated techniques such as mixture models, Student's t-distributions, or conformal prediction, they fail to address the core challenge of providing theoretically-grounded uncertainty decomposition. For the very first time, we present a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework, ProbFM (probabilistic foundation model), that leverages Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to provide principled uncertainty quantification with explicit epistemic-aleatoric decomposition. Unlike existing approaches that pre-specify distributional forms or require sampling-based inference, ProbFM learns optimal uncertainty representations through higher-order evidence learning while maintaining single-pass computational efficiency. To rigorously evaluate the core DER uncertainty quantification approach independent of architectural complexity, we conduct an extensive controlled comparison study using a consistent LSTM architecture across five probabilistic methods: DER, Gaussian NLL, Student's-t NLL, Quantile Loss, and Conformal Prediction. Evaluation on cryptocurrency return forecasting demonstrates that DER maintains competitive forecasting accuracy while providing explicit epistemic-aleatoric uncertainty decomposition. This work establishes both an extensible framework for principled uncertainty quantification in foundation models and empirical evidence for DER's effectiveness in financial applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Lossless compression using Huffman codes is an effective way to alleviate the issue, however, its three-stage design requiring on-the-fly frequency analysis, codebook generation and transmission of codebook along with data introduces computational, latency and data overheads which are prohibitive for latency-sensitive scenarios such as die-to-die communication. This paper proposes a single-stage Huffman encoder that eliminates these overheads by using fixed codebooks derived from the average probability distribution of previous data batches. Through our analysis of the Gemma 2B model, we demonstrate that tensors exhibit high statistical similarity across layers and shards. Using this approach we achieve compression within 0.5% of per-shard Huffman coding and within 1% of the ideal Shannon compressibility, enabling efficient on-the-fly compression.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This has spurred an intense interest in the origin of neural scaling laws, with a common suggestion being that they arise from power law structure already present in the data. In this paper we study scaling laws for transformers trained to predict random walks (bigrams) on graphs with tunable complexity. We demonstrate that this simplified setting already gives rise to neural scaling laws even in the absence of power law structure in the data correlations. We further consider dialing down the complexity of natural language systematically, by training on sequences sampled from increasingly simplified generative language models, from 4,2,1-layer transformer language models down to language bigrams, revealing a monotonic evolution of the scaling exponents. Our results also include scaling laws obtained from training on random walks on random graphs drawn from Erd\u00f6s-Renyi and scale-free Barab\u00e1si-Albert ensembles. Finally, we revisit conventional scaling laws for language modeling, demonstrating that several essential results can be reproduced using 2 layer transformers with context length of 50, provide a critical analysis of various fits used in prior literature, demonstrate an alternative method for obtaining compute optimal curves as compared with current practice in published literature, and provide preliminary evidence that maximal update parameterization may be more parameter efficient than standard parameterization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although reduced-order models (ROMs) offer a promising solution, current methods often struggle with stochastic dynamics and fail to quantify prediction uncertainty, limiting their utility in robust decision-making contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce a data-driven framework for learning continuous-time stochastic ROMs that generalize across parameter spaces and forcing conditions. Our approach, based on amortized stochastic variational inference, leverages a reparametrization trick for Markov Gaussian processes to eliminate the need for computationally expensive forward solvers during training. This enables us to jointly learn a probabilistic autoencoder and stochastic differential equations governing the latent dynamics, at a computational cost that is independent of the dataset size and system stiffness. Additionally, our approach offers the flexibility of incorporating physics-informed priors if available. Numerical studies are presented for three challenging test problems, where we demonstrate excellent generalization to unseen parameter combinations and forcings, and significant efficiency gains compared to existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u644a\u9500\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u8de8\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5f3a\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u968f\u673a\u964d\u9636\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u524d\u5411\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u964d\u9636\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u644a\u9500\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6280\u5de7\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u6982\u7387\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u521a\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u5f3a\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u6982\u7387\u964d\u9636\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u53c8\u652f\u6301\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u878d\u5408\u3002"}}

Continued study of federated learning is essential to address key challenges in it, including communication efficiency and privacy protection between parties. A recent line of work introduced a novel approach called the Communication-Efficient and Privacy-Adaptable Mechanism (CEPAM), which achieves both objectives simultaneously. CEPAM leverages the rejection-sampled universal quantizer (RSUQ), a randomized vector quantizer whose quantization error is equivalent to a prescribed noise, which can be tuned to customize privacy protection between parties. In this work, we theoretically analyze the privacy guarantees and convergence properties of CEPAM. Moreover, we assess CEPAM's utility performance through experimental evaluations, including convergence profiles compared with other baselines, and accuracy-privacy trade-offs between different parties.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The setting captures three system effects in federated and distributed deployments: (i) stale updates due to delayed model delivery and delayed application of client computations (two-sided version lag), (ii) partial participation (intermittent client availability), and (iii) imperfect communication on both downlink and uplink, modeled as effective zero-mean additive noise with bounded second moment. We introduce a server-side aggregation rule called staleness-bucket aggregation with padding that deterministically enforces a prescribed staleness profile over update ages without assuming any stochastic model for delays or participation. Under margin separability and bounded data radius, we prove a finite-horizon expected bound on the cumulative weighted number of perceptron mistakes over a given number of server rounds: the impact of delay appears only through the mean enforced staleness, whereas communication noise contributes an additional term that grows on the order of the square root of the horizon with the total noise energy. In the noiseless case, we show how a finite expected mistake budget yields an explicit finite-round stabilization bound under a mild fresh-participation condition.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
