Abstract: Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Medical MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in specialized medical tasks; however, research into their safety has lagged, posing potential risks for real-world deployment. In this paper, we first establish a multidimensional evaluation framework to systematically benchmark the safety of current SOTA Medical MLLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals pervasive vulnerabilities across both general and medical-specific safety dimensions in existing models, particularly highlighting their fragility against cross-modality jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, we find that the medical fine-tuning process frequently induces catastrophic forgetting of the model's original safety alignment. To address this challenge, we propose a novel "Parameter-Space Intervention" approach for efficient safety re-alignment. This method extracts intrinsic safety knowledge representations from original base models and concurrently injects them into the target model during the construction of medical capabilities. Additionally, we design a fine-grained parameter search algorithm to achieve an optimal trade-off between safety and medical performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly bolsters the safety guardrails of Medical MLLMs without relying on additional domain-specific safety data, while minimizing degradation to core medical performance.

Abstract: Energy efficiency is a first-order concern in AI deployment, as long-running inference can exceed training in cumulative carbon impact. We propose a bio-inspired framework that maps protein-folding energy basins to inference cost landscapes and controls execution via a decaying, closed-loop threshold. A request is admitted only when the expected utility-to-energy trade-off is favorable (high confidence/utility at low marginal energy and congestion), biasing operation toward the first acceptable local basin rather than pursuing costly global minima. We evaluate DistilBERT and ResNet-18 served through FastAPI with ONNX Runtime and NVIDIA Triton on an RTX 4000 Ada GPU. Our ablation study reveals that the bio-controller reduces processing time by 42% compared to standard open-loop execution (0.50s vs 0.29s on A100 test set), with a minimal accuracy degradation (<0.5%). Furthermore, we establish the efficiency boundaries between lightweight local serving (ORT) and managed batching (Triton). The results connect biophysical energy models to Green MLOps and offer a practical, auditable basis for closed-loop energy-aware inference in production.

TL;DR: 论文CAST框架通过诊断注意力头层级的冲突分布，选择性地跳过高冲突头的更新，在微调中实现更好的安全对齐与通用能力的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型安全对齐方法通常采用全局梯度几何来解决多目标优化冲突，但忽视了Transformer中不同注意力头在功能敏感性和冲突程度上的显著差异，导致对通用能力的不必要损害。

Method: 提出冲突感知稀疏调优（CAST）框架，首先通过综合优化冲突和功能敏感性构建预对齐冲突图，然后基于该图选择性地更新参数，在训练期间跳过高冲突的注意力头。

Result: 实验表明LLM中的对齐冲突分布不均匀，发现通用能力下降主要来自更新一小群“高冲突”头。通过简单跳过这些头的训练，在不影响安全性的情况下显著减少了能力损失。

Conclusion: CAST提供了一个可解释且参数高效的方法，通过头层级诊断和稀疏微调改善了安全对齐与通用能力之间的权衡。

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently presents a multi-objective optimization conflict, often accompanied by an unintended degradation of general capabilities. Existing mitigation strategies typically rely on global gradient geometry to resolve these conflicts, yet they overlook Modular Heterogeneity within Transformers, specifically that the functional sensitivity and degree of conflict vary substantially across different attention heads. Such global approaches impose uniform update rules across all parameters, often resulting in suboptimal trade-offs by indiscriminately updating utility sensitive heads that exhibit intense gradient conflicts. To address this limitation, we propose Conflict-Aware Sparse Tuning (CAST), a framework that integrates head-level diagnosis with sparse fine-tuning. CAST first constructs a pre-alignment conflict map by synthesizing Optimization Conflict and Functional Sensitivity, which then guides the selective update of parameters. Experiments reveal that alignment conflicts in LLMs are not uniformly distributed. We find that the drop in general capabilities mainly comes from updating a small group of ``high-conflict'' heads. By simply skipping these heads during training, we significantly reduce this loss without compromising safety, offering an interpretable and parameter-efficient approach to improving the safety-utility trade-off.

TL;DR: 提出时态显著性蒸馏(TSD)，通过传递教师模型的时间显著性（各时间步对预测的重要性）来改进时间序列知识蒸馏，使学生在相同输入特征上做出预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列知识蒸馏主要基于计算机视觉的logit和特征对齐方法，未显式考虑时序数据。这些方法存在两大缺陷：1)传递的知识机制不明确（logit和特征不可解释）；2)仅传递有限知识，主要复制教师预测准确性，导致学生预测分布与教师差异大，难以安全替代。

Method: 扩展传统logit传递，引入时间显著性蒸馏。从教师logits中提取时间显著性信息（各输入时间步对预测的重要性），并以此训练学生模型，使其依据与教师相同的输入特征进行预测。该方法无需额外参数或特定架构假设。

Result: 实验表明，时间显著性蒸馏有效提升了基线方法的性能，同时实现了超出预测准确率的理想特性（如与教师更一致的预测分布）。

Conclusion: 本研究为时间序列分析中的可解释知识蒸馏建立了新范式，通过传递教师的推理过程（时间显著性）提升学生模型性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation has proven effective for model compression by transferring knowledge from a larger network called the teacher to a smaller network called the student. Current knowledge distillation in time series is predominantly based on logit and feature aligning techniques originally developed for computer vision tasks. These methods do not explicitly account for temporal data and fall short in two key aspects. First, the mechanisms by which the transferred knowledge helps the student model learning process remain unclear due to uninterpretability of logits and features. Second, these methods transfer only limited knowledge, primarily replicating the teacher predictive accuracy. As a result, student models often produce predictive distributions that differ significantly from those of their teachers, hindering their safe substitution for teacher models. In this work, we propose transferring interpretable knowledge by extending conventional logit transfer to convey not just the right prediction but also the right reasoning of the teacher. Specifically, we induce other useful knowledge from the teacher logits termed temporal saliency which captures the importance of each input timestep to the teacher prediction. By training the student with Temporal Saliency Distillation we encourage it to make predictions based on the same input features as the teacher. Temporal Saliency Distillation requires no additional parameters or architecture specific assumptions. We demonstrate that Temporal Saliency Distillation effectively improves the performance of baseline methods while also achieving desirable properties beyond predictive accuracy. We hope our work establishes a new paradigm for interpretable knowledge distillation in time series analysis.

Abstract: Deep learning models, particularly recurrent neural networks and their variants, such as long short-term memory, have significantly advanced time series data analysis. These models capture complex, sequential patterns in time series, enabling real-time assessments. However, their high computational complexity and large model sizes pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as wearable devices and edge computing platforms. Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from a large, complex model (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient model (student), thereby retaining high performance while reducing computational demands. Current KD methods, originally designed for computer vision tasks, neglect the unique temporal dependencies and memory retention characteristics of time series models. To this end, we propose a novel KD framework termed Memory-Discrepancy Knowledge Distillation (MemKD). MemKD leverages a specialized loss function to capture memory retention discrepancies between the teacher and student models across subsequences within time series data, ensuring that the student model effectively mimics the teacher model's behaviour. This approach facilitates the development of compact, high-performing recurrent neural networks suitable for real-time, time series analysis tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MemKD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods. It reduces parameter size and memory usage by approximately 500 times while maintaining comparable performance to the teacher model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为在线动作堆叠的推理时包装器，用于增强强化学习策略在空管指令生成中的应用，通过将简单的原始动作组合成符合领域要求的复合指令，减少所需动作空间维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准强化学习在空管控制中存在动作空间复杂性与实际操作需求不匹配的问题：训练需要大量离散动作，而实际操作需要复合指令。本文旨在通过简化训练动作空间同时保持推理时生成符合领域要求的复合指令来弥合这一差距。

Method: 提出在线动作堆叠方法：1) 使用PPO算法在BluebirdDT数字孪生平台上训练，仅使用简单的航向调整、高度调整等原始动作；2) 添加动作阻尼惩罚减少指令频率；3) 在推理时将连续原始动作编译成复合指令；4) 实验包括横向导航、高度管理、双机避碰等场景，动作空间从37维简化到5维。

Result: 1) 在线动作堆叠显著减少指令数量（相比阻尼基线）；2) 仅用5个动作达到与37维动作空间策略相当的性能；3) 在横向导航、高度管理、碰撞避免任务中有效；4) 动作阻尼使智能体以短脉冲形式发出指令，便于堆叠。

Conclusion: 在线动作堆叠有效弥合了标准强化学习公式与操作型空管需求之间的关键差距，为扩展到更复杂控制场景提供了简单机制，证明了通过推理时动作组合可以在小动作空间训练的同时生成符合领域要求的复合指令。

Abstract: We introduce online action-stacking, an inference-time wrapper for reinforcement learning policies that produces realistic air traffic control commands while allowing training on a much smaller discrete action space. Policies are trained with simple incremental heading or level adjustments, together with an action-damping penalty that reduces instruction frequency and leads agents to issue commands in short bursts. At inference, online action-stacking compiles these bursts of primitive actions into domain-appropriate compound clearances. Using Proximal Policy Optimisation and the BluebirdDT digital twin platform, we train agents to navigate aircraft along lateral routes, manage climb and descent to target flight levels, and perform two-aircraft collision avoidance under a minimum separation constraint. In our lateral navigation experiments, action stacking greatly reduces the number of issued instructions relative to a damped baseline and achieves comparable performance to a policy trained with a 37-dimensional action space, despite operating with only five actions. These results indicate that online action-stacking helps bridge a key gap between standard reinforcement learning formulations and operational ATC requirements, and provides a simple mechanism for scaling to more complex control scenarios.

Conclusion: 强化学习能够提供技能丰富、状态依赖且具有区域感知的参数化方案，为数值模型中的在线学习提供了一条可扩展的途径。

Abstract: Weather and climate models rely on parametrisations to represent unresolved sub-grid processes. Traditional schemes rely on fixed coefficients that are weakly constrained and tuned offline, contributing to persistent biases that limit their ability to adapt to the underlying physics. This study presents a framework that learns components of parametrisation schemes online as a function of the evolving model state using reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluates the resulting RL-driven parameter updates across a hierarchy of idealised testbeds spanning a simple climate bias correction (SCBC), a radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), and a zonal mean energy balance model (EBM) with both single-agent and federated multi-agent settings. Across nine RL algorithms, Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) achieved the highest skill and the most stable convergence across configurations, with performance assessed against a static baseline using area-weighted RMSE, temperature profile and pressure-level diagnostics. For the EBM, single-agent RL outperformed static parameter tuning with the strongest gains in tropical and mid-latitude bands, while federated RL on multi-agent setups enabled geographically specialised control and faster convergence, with a six-agent DDPG configuration using frequent aggregation yielding the lowest area-weighted RMSE across the tropics and mid-latitudes. The learnt corrections were also physically meaningful as agents modulated EBM radiative parameters to reduce meridional biases, adjusted RCE lapse rates to match vertical temperature errors, and stabilised SCBC heating increments to limit drift. Overall, results highlight RL to deliver skilful state-dependent, and regime-aware parametrisations, offering a scalable pathway for online learning within numerical models.

Motivation: 协同感知技术面临信息时效性和通信资源约束两大挑战：1) 环境动态性要求传输信息具有时效性 2)传感器计算能力和无线带宽有限需要精心设计通信量

Method: 提出TAMP调度算法：1) 定义将AoI和通信量联合影响映射到感知性能的经验惩罚函数 2) 基于Lyapunov优化，将长期平均目标分解为时隙优先调度问题，平衡调度价值与资源成本 3) 在多区域CP场景中实现动态调度

Conclusion: TAMP算法通过综合考虑信息时效性和资源约束，有效解决了协同感知中的动态调度问题，在感知精度和通信资源使用之间取得了良好平衡

Abstract: Collaborative perception (CP) is a critical technology in applications like autonomous driving and smart cities. It involves the sharing and fusion of information among sensors to overcome the limitations of individual perception, such as blind spots and range limitations. However, CP faces two primary challenges. First, due to the dynamic nature of the environment, the timeliness of the transmitted information is critical to perception performance. Second, with limited computational power at the sensors and constrained wireless bandwidth, the communication volume must be carefully designed to ensure feature representations are both effective and sufficient. This work studies the dynamic scheduling problem in a multi-region CP scenario, and presents a Timeliness-Aware Multi-region Prioritized (TAMP) scheduling algorithm to trade-off perception accuracy and communication resource usage. Timeliness reflects the utility of information that decays as time elapses, which is manifested by the perception performance in CP tasks. We propose an empirical penalty function that maps the joint impact of Age of Information (AoI) and communication volume to perception performance. Aiming to minimize this timeliness-oriented penalty in the long-term, and recognizing that scheduling decisions have a cumulative effect on subsequent system states, we propose the TAMP scheduling algorithm. TAMP is a Lyapunov-based optimization policy that decomposes the long-term average objective into a per-slot prioritization problem, balancing the scheduling worth against resource cost. We validate our algorithm in both intersection and corridor scenarios with the real-world Roadside Cooperative perception (RCooper) dataset. Extensive simulations demonstrate that TAMP outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an Average Precision (AP) improvement of up to 27% across various configurations.

Abstract: Deep learning optimization exhibits structure that is not captured by worst-case gradient bounds. Empirically, gradients along training trajectories are often temporally predictable and evolve within a low-dimensional subspace. In this work we formalize this observation through a measurable framework for predictable gradient manifolds.
  We introduce two computable quantities: a prediction-based path length that measures how well gradients can be forecast from past information, and a predictable rank that quantifies the intrinsic temporal dimension of gradient increments. We show how classical online and nonconvex optimization guarantees can be restated so that convergence and regret depend explicitly on these quantities, rather than on worst-case variation.
  Across convolutional networks, vision transformers, language models, and synthetic control tasks, we find that gradient trajectories are locally predictable and exhibit strong low-rank structure over time. These properties are stable across architectures and optimizers, and can be diagnosed directly from logged gradients using lightweight random projections.
  Our results provide a unifying lens for understanding optimization dynamics in modern deep learning, reframing standard training as operating in a low-complexity temporal regime. This perspective suggests new directions for adaptive optimizers, rank-aware tracking, and prediction-based algorithm design grounded in measurable properties of real training runs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning graph-structured data, but their scalability is hindered by inefficient mini-batch generation, data transfer bottlenecks, and costly inter-GPU synchronization. Existing training frameworks fail to overlap these stages, leading to suboptimal resource utilization. This paper proposes MQ-GNN, a multi-queue pipelined framework that maximizes training efficiency by interleaving GNN training stages and optimizing resource utilization. MQ-GNN introduces Ready-to-Update Asynchronous Consistent Model (RaCoM), which enables asynchronous gradient sharing and model updates while ensuring global consistency through adaptive periodic synchronization. Additionally, it employs global neighbor sampling with caching to reduce data transfer overhead and an adaptive queue-sizing strategy to balance computation and memory efficiency. Experiments on four large-scale datasets and ten baseline models demonstrate that MQ-GNN achieves up to \boldmath $\bm{4.6\,\times}$ faster training time and 30% improved GPU utilization while maintaining competitive accuracy. These results establish MQ-GNN as a scalable and efficient solution for multi-GPU GNN training.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Post-training improves large language models (LLMs) but often worsens confidence calibration, leading to systematic overconfidence. Recent unsupervised post-hoc methods for post-trained LMs (PoLMs) mitigate this by aligning PoLM confidence to that of well-calibrated pre-trained counterparts. However, framing calibration as static output-distribution matching overlooks the inference-time dynamics introduced by post-training. In particular, we show that calibration errors arise from two regimes: (i) confidence drift, where final confidence inflates despite largely consistent intermediate decision processes, and (ii) process drift, where intermediate inference pathways diverge. Guided by this diagnosis, we propose Dual-Align, an unsupervised post-hoc framework for dual alignment in confidence calibration. Dual-Align performs confidence alignment to correct confidence drift via final-distribution matching, and introduces process alignment to address process drift by locating the layer where trajectories diverge and realigning the stability of subsequent inference. This dual strategy learns a single temperature parameter that corrects both drift types without sacrificing post-training performance gains. Experiments show consistent improvements over baselines, reducing calibration errors and approaching a supervised oracle.

Abstract: The generation of synthetic data is receiving increasing attention from the scientific community, thanks to its ability to solve problems like data scarcity and privacy, and is starting to find applications in air transport. We here tackle the problem of generating synthetic, yet realistic, time series of delays at airports, starting from large collections of operations in Europe and the US. We specifically compare three models, two of them based on state of the art Deep Learning algorithms, and one simplified Genetic Algorithm approach. We show how the latter can generate time series that are almost indistinguishable from real ones, while maintaining a high variability. We further validate the resulting time series in a problem of detecting delay propagations between airports. We finally make the synthetic data available to the scientific community.

Abstract: Machine unlearning has become a crucial role in enabling generative models trained on large datasets to remove sensitive, private, or copyright-protected data. However, existing machine unlearning methods face three challenges in learning to forget identity of generative models: 1) inefficient, where identity erasure requires fine-tuning all the model's parameters; 2) limited controllability, where forgetting intensity cannot be controlled and explainability is lacking; 3) catastrophic collapse, where the model's retention capability undergoes drastic degradation as forgetting progresses. Forgetting has typically been handled through discrete and unstable updates, often requiring full-model fine-tuning and leading to catastrophic collapse. In this work, we argue that identity forgetting should be modeled as a continuous trajectory, and introduce LEGATO - Learn to ForgEt Identity in GenerAtive Models via Trajectory-consistent Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. LEGATO augments pre-trained generators with fine-tunable lightweight Neural ODE adapters, enabling smooth, controllable forgetting while keeping the original model weights frozen. This formulation allows forgetting intensity to be precisely modulated via ODE step size, offering interpretability and robustness. To further ensure stability, we introduce trajectory consistency constraints that explicitly prevent catastrophic collapse during unlearning. Extensive experiments across in-domain and out-of-domain identity unlearning benchmarks show that LEGATO achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance, avoids catastrophic collapse and reduces fine-tuned parameters.

Abstract: Building on insights from the grokking literature, we study character-level Transformers trained to compute modular addition from text, and focus on robustness under input-format variation rather than only in-distribution accuracy. We identify a previously under-emphasized failure mode: models that achieve high in-distribution accuracy can fail catastrophically when the same expression is shifted to different absolute character positions ("position shift") or presented under out-of-distribution natural-language templates. Using a disjoint-pair split over all ordered pairs for p=97, we show that a baseline model reaches strong in-distribution performance yet collapses under position shift and template OOD. We then introduce a simple training recipe that combines (i) explicit expression boundary markers, (ii) position curriculum that broadens the range of absolute positions seen during training, (iii) diverse template mixtures, and (iv) consistency training across multiple variants per example. Across three seeds, this intervention substantially improves robustness to position shift and template OOD while maintaining high in-distribution accuracy, whereas an ALiBi-style ablation fails to learn the task under our setup. Our results suggest that steering procedural generalization under noisy supervision benefits from explicitly training invariances that are otherwise absent from the data distribution, and we provide a reproducible evaluation protocol and artifacts.

Abstract: Objective: Stroke is one of the leading causes of disabilities. One promising approach is to extend the rehabilitation with self-initiated robot-assisted movement therapy. To enable this, it is required to detect the patient's intention to move to trigger the assistance of a robotic device. This intention to move can be detected from human surface electroencephalography (EEG) signals; however, it is particularly challenging to decode when classifications are performed online and asynchronously. In this work, the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing technique was investigated to enhance the robustness of such asynchronous classification. Approach: To investigate the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing, two EEG datasets with 14 healthy subjects who performed self-initiated arm movements were analyzed. Offline and pseudo-online evaluations were conducted to compare ensemble combinations of the support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and EEGNet classification models. Results: The results of the pseudo-online evaluation show that the two model ensembles significantly outperformed the best single model for the optimal number of postprocessing windows. In particular, for single models, an increased number of postprocessing windows significantly improved classification performances. Interestingly, we found no significant improvements between performances of the best single model and classifier ensembles in the offline evaluation. Significance: We demonstrated that classifier ensembles and appropriate postprocessing methods effectively enhance the asynchronous detection of movement intentions from EEG signals. In particular, the classifier ensemble approach yields greater improvements in online classification than in offline classification, and reduces false detections, i.e., early false positives.

Abstract: The objective assessment of human affective and psychological states presents a significant challenge, particularly through non-verbal channels. This paper introduces digital drawing as a rich and underexplored modality for affective sensing. We present a novel multimodal framework, named ArtCognition, for the automated analysis of the House-Tree-Person (HTP) test, a widely used psychological instrument. ArtCognition uniquely fuses two distinct data streams: static visual features from the final artwork, captured by computer vision models, and dynamic behavioral kinematic cues derived from the drawing process itself, such as stroke speed, pauses, and smoothness. To bridge the gap between low-level features and high-level psychological interpretation, we employ a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. This grounds the analysis in established psychological knowledge, enhancing explainability and reducing the potential for model hallucination. Our results demonstrate that the fusion of visual and behavioral kinematic cues provides a more nuanced assessment than either modality alone. We show significant correlations between the extracted multimodal features and standardized psychological metrics, validating the framework's potential as a scalable tool to support clinicians. This work contributes a new methodology for non-intrusive affective state assessment and opens new avenues for technology-assisted mental healthcare.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 1型糖尿病(T1D)具有高度代谢异质性，传统生物标志物(如HbA1c)无法充分表征病情。需要一种能够整合多维动态数据的方法来发现代谢亚组并进行风险分层。

Method: 提出可解释的深度学习框架，使用Transformer编码器建模连续葡萄糖监测(CGM)数据和实验室资料的多模态时序依赖关系，通过高斯混合模型识别潜在代谢表型，并利用Transformer注意力可视化和SHAP特征归因实现模型可解释性。

Result: 在577名T1D患者中识别出五个潜在代谢表型，从代谢稳定性到升高心脏代谢风险不等；这些表型在血糖控制、脂质代谢、肾脏标志物和促甲状腺激素(TSH)方面具有显著差异；注意力分析显示葡萄糖变异性是主要时序因素；SHAP分析确定HbA1c、甘油三酯、胆固醇、肌酐和TSH是表型分化的关键贡献因素；表型成员与高血压、心肌梗死和心力衰竭存在显著但适度的统计学关联。

Conclusion: 该可解释的多模态时序嵌入框架揭示了T1D中生理意义一致的代谢亚组，并支持超越单一生物标志物的风险分层，为个性化T1D管理提供了新方法。

Abstract: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a highly metabolically heterogeneous disease that cannot be adequately characterized by conventional biomarkers such as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). This study proposes an explainable deep learning framework that integrates continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data with laboratory profiles to learn multimodal temporal embeddings of individual metabolic status. Temporal dependencies across modalities are modeled using a transformer encoder, while latent metabolic phenotypes are identified via Gaussian mixture modeling. Model interpretability is achieved through transformer attention visualization and SHAP-based feature attribution. Five latent metabolic phenotypes, ranging from metabolic stability to elevated cardiometabolic risk, were identified among 577 individuals with T1D. These phenotypes exhibit distinct biochemical profiles, including differences in glycemic control, lipid metabolism, renal markers, and thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Attention analysis highlights glucose variability as a dominant temporal factor, while SHAP analysis identifies HbA1c, triglycerides, cholesterol, creatinine, and TSH as key contributors to phenotype differentiation. Phenotype membership shows statistically significant, albeit modest, associations with hypertension, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Overall, this explainable multimodal temporal embedding framework reveals physiologically coherent metabolic subgroups in T1D and supports risk stratification beyond single biomarkers.

Abstract: As frontier AI systems are pretrained on web-scale data, test set contamination has become a critical concern for accurately assessing their capabilities. While research has thoroughly investigated the impact of test set contamination on discriminative evaluations like multiple-choice question-answering, comparatively little research has studied the impact of test set contamination on generative evaluations. In this work, we quantitatively assess the effect of test set contamination on generative evaluations through the language model lifecycle. We pretrain language models on mixtures of web data and the MATH benchmark, sweeping model sizes and number of test set replicas contaminating the pretraining corpus; performance improves with contamination and model size. Using scaling laws, we make a surprising discovery: including even a single test set replica enables models to achieve lower loss than the irreducible error of training on the uncontaminated corpus. We then study further training: overtraining with fresh data reduces the effects of contamination, whereas supervised finetuning on the training set can either increase or decrease performance on test data, depending on the amount of pretraining contamination. Finally, at inference, we identify factors that modulate memorization: high sampling temperatures mitigate contamination effects, and longer solutions are exponentially more difficult to memorize than shorter ones, presenting a contrast with discriminative evaluations, where solutions are only a few tokens in length. By characterizing how generation and memorization interact, we highlight a new layer of complexity for trustworthy evaluation of AI systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在因果系统的域适应设置中，目标变量在源域中可观测但在目标域中完全缺失。研究者需要从目标域的其他观测变量中估算缺失的目标变量，同时应对各种分布偏移的挑战。

Method: 针对线性高斯因果模型，推导了闭式高斯信息瓶颈（GIB）解决方案，简化为CCA式投影，并提供了DAG感知选项。对于非线性或非高斯数据，引入了变分信息瓶颈（VIB）编码器-预测器框架，在源域数据上训练后可直接零样本部署到目标域。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个统一、轻量级的因果域适应工具包，能够在目标变量完全缺失的情况下实现准确预测，适用于高维因果模型的实际部署场景。

Abstract: We tackle a common domain adaptation setting in causal systems. In this setting, the target variable is observed in the source domain but is entirely missing in the target domain. We aim to impute the target variable in the target domain from the remaining observed variables under various shifts. We frame this as learning a compact, mechanism-stable representation. This representation preserves information relevant for predicting the target while discarding spurious variation. For linear Gaussian causal models, we derive a closed-form Gaussian Information Bottleneck (GIB) solution. This solution reduces to a canonical correlation analysis (CCA)-style projection and offers Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-aware options when desired. For nonlinear or non-Gaussian data, we introduce a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) encoder-predictor. This approach scales to high dimensions and can be trained on source data and deployed zero-shot to the target domain. Across synthetic and real datasets, our approach consistently attains accurate imputations, supporting practical use in high-dimensional causal models and furnishing a unified, lightweight toolkit for causal domain adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统振荡计算基板面临的核心挑战是在线权重更新可能导致系统陷入不良状态（如全局同步），破坏表示多样性。研究旨在开发一种既能保持振荡计算优势又能维持系统稳定性的学习框架，借鉴生物神经系统中的突触标记捕获和睡眠阶段动态机制。

Method: 采用相位图作为内部状态表示，其中每个Stuart-Landau振荡器作为计算单元追踪相对时序（相干性）和局部增益（振幅）。通过三因子局部可塑性（由稀疏全局调节器和振荡定时写入窗口门控的资格迹）学习耦合权重，无需反向传播。为解决稳定性问题，引入类似睡眠阶段的离线巩固过程：深度睡眠式门控捕获安全提交标记的权重更改，快速眼动睡眠式回放重建并扰动经验以进行规划。

Result: 阶段性实验表明：1）资格迹能在延迟调制下保持信用分配；2）压缩进度信号通过时间戳洗牌控制；3）相位相干检索在噪声下达到扩散基线的4倍性能；4）觉醒/睡眠分离在匹配权重范数预算下将稳定学习扩展了67%；5）快速眼动睡眠回放将迷宫成功率提高了45.5个百分点；6）出现了托尔曼式潜在学习特征——在无奖励探索后立即展示能力和迂回优势，表明内部模型的形成。

Conclusion: 相位智能体框架通过将振荡计算与受生物启发的离线巩固机制相结合，成功解决了动态系统的稳定性挑战。实验验证了各个机制的独立效果及其协同作用，实现了鲁棒的学习性能和内部模型的涌现，所有代码和实验数据均已开源。

Abstract: Phasor Agents are dynamical systems whose internal state is a Phasor Graph: a weighted graph of coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators. A Stuart-Landau oscillator is a minimal stable "rhythm generator" (the normal form near a Hopf bifurcation); each oscillator is treated as an abstract computational unit (inspired by, but not claiming to model, biological oscillatory populations). In this interpretation, oscillator phase tracks relative timing (coherence), while amplitude tracks local gain or activity. Relative phase structure serves as a representational medium; coupling weights are learned via three-factor local plasticity - eligibility traces gated by sparse global modulators and oscillation-timed write windows - without backpropagation.
  A central challenge in oscillatory substrates is stability: online weight updates can drive the network into unwanted regimes (e.g., global synchrony), collapsing representational diversity. We therefore separate wake tagging from offline consolidation, inspired by synaptic tagging-and-capture and sleep-stage dynamics: deep-sleep-like gated capture commits tagged changes safely, while REM-like replay reconstructs and perturbs experience for planning.
  A staged experiment suite validates each mechanism with ablations and falsifiers: eligibility traces preserve credit under delayed modulation; compression-progress signals pass timestamp-shuffle controls; phase-coherent retrieval reaches 4x diffusive baselines under noise; wake/sleep separation expands stable learning by 67 percent under matched weight-norm budgets; REM replay improves maze success rate by +45.5 percentage points; and a Tolman-style latent-learning signature - immediate competence and detour advantage after unrewarded exploration, consistent with an internal model - emerges from replay (Tolman, 1948).
  The codebase and all artifacts are open-source.

Abstract: In evolutionary reinforcement learning tasks (ERL), agent policies are often encoded as small artificial neural networks (NERL). Such representations lack explicit modular structure, limiting behavioral interpretation. We investigate whether programmatic policies (PERL), implemented as soft, differentiable decision lists (SDDL), can match the performance of NERL. To support reproducible evaluation, we provide the first fully specified and open-source reimplementation of the classic 1992 Artificial Life (ALife) ERL testbed. We conduct a rigorous survival analysis across 4000 independent trials utilizing Kaplan-Meier curves and Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) metrics absent in the original study. We find a statistically significant difference in survival probability between PERL and NERL. PERL agents survive on average 201.69 steps longer than NERL agents. Moreover, SDDL agents using learning alone (no evolution) survive on average 73.67 steps longer than neural agents using both learning and evaluation. These results demonstrate that programmatic policies can exceed the survival performance of neural policies in ALife.

Abstract: Feature attribution is the dominant paradigm for explaining deep neural networks. However, most existing methods only loosely reflect the model's prediction-making process, thereby merely white-painting the black box. We argue that explanatory alignment is a key aspect of trustworthiness in prediction tasks: explanations must be directly linked to predictions, rather than serving as post-hoc rationalizations. We present model readability as a design principle enabling alignment, and PiNets as a modeling framework to pursue it in a deep learning context. PiNets are pseudo-linear networks that produce instance-wise linear predictions in an arbitrary feature space, making them linearly readable. We illustrate their use on image classification and segmentation tasks, demonstrating how PiNets produce explanations that are faithful across multiple criteria in addition to alignment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a simple but powerful paradigm for training LLMs: sample a completion, verify it, and update. In practice, however, the verifier is almost never clean--unit tests probe only limited corner cases; human and synthetic labels are imperfect; and LLM judges (e.g., RLAIF) are noisy and can be exploited--and this problem worsens on harder domains (especially coding) where tests are sparse and increasingly model-generated. We ask a pragmatic question: does the verification noise merely slow down the learning (rate), or can it flip the outcome (fate)?
  To address this, we develop an analytically tractable multi-armed bandit view of RLVR dynamics, instantiated with GRPO and validated in controlled experiments. Modeling false positives and false negatives and grouping completions into recurring reasoning modes yields a replicator-style (natural-selection) flow on the probability simplex. The dynamics decouples into within-correct-mode competition and a one-dimensional evolution for the mass on incorrect modes, whose drift is determined solely by Youden's index J=TPR-FPR. This yields a sharp phase transition: when J>0, the incorrect mass is driven toward extinction (learning); when J=0, the process is neutral; and when J<0, incorrect modes amplify until they dominate (anti-learning and collapse). In the learning regime J>0, noise primarily rescales convergence time ("rate, not fate"). Experiments on verifiable programming tasks under synthetic noise reproduce the predicted J=0 boundary. Beyond noise, the framework offers a general lens for analyzing RLVR stability, convergence, and algorithmic interventions.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training data from a learned model without full retraining. While recent work has begun to explore unlearning in quantum machine learning, existing approaches largely rely on fixed, uniform target distributions and do not explicitly control the trade-off between forgetting and retained model behaviour. In this work, we propose a distribution-guided framework for class-level quantum machine unlearning that treats unlearning as a constrained optimization problem. Our method introduces a tunable target distribution derived from model similarity statistics, decoupling the suppression of forgotten-class confidence from assumptions about redistribution among retained classes. We further incorporate an anchor-based preservation constraint that explicitly maintains predictive behaviour on selected retained data, yielding a controlled optimization trajectory that limits deviation from the original model. We evaluate the approach on variational quantum classifiers trained on the Iris and Covertype datasets. Results demonstrate sharp suppression of forgotten-class confidence, minimal degradation of retained-class performance, and closer alignment with the gold retrained model baselines compared to uniform-target unlearning. These findings highlight the importance of target design and constraint-based formulations for reliable and interpretable quantum machine unlearning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly used in high-stakes domains where their predictions can actively shape the environments in which they operate, a phenomenon known as performative prediction. This dynamic, in which the deployment of the model influences the very outcome it seeks to predict, can lead to unintended consequences, including feedback loops, performance issues, and significant societal risks. While the literature in the field has grown rapidly in recent years, a socio-technical synthesis that systemises the phenomenon concepts and provides practical guidance has been lacking. This Systematisation of Knowledge (SoK) addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of the literature on performative predictions. We provide an overview of the primary mechanisms through which performativity manifests, present a typology of associated risks, and survey the proposed solutions offered in the literature. Our primary contribution is the ``Performative Strength vs. Impact Matrix" assessment framework. This practical tool is designed to help practitioners assess the potential influence and severity of performativity on their deployed predictive models and select the appropriate level of algorithmic or human intervention.

Abstract: Prolonged length of stay (pLoS) is a significant factor associated with the risk of adverse in-hospital events. We develop and explain a predictive model for pLos using admission-level patient and hospital administrative data. The approach includes a feature selection method by selecting non-correlated features with the highest information value. The method uses features weights of evidence to select a representative within cliques from graph theory. The prognosis study analyzed the records from 120,354 hospital admissions at the Hospital Alma Mater de Antioquia between January 2017 and March 2022. After a cleaning process the dataset was split into training (67%), test (22%), and validation (11%) cohorts. A logistic regression model was trained to predict the pLoS in two classes: less than or greater than 7 days. The performance of the model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC-ROC metrics. The feature selection method returns nine interpretable variables, enhancing the models' transparency. In the validation cohort, the pLoS model achieved a specificity of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.82-0.84), sensitivity of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.62-0.65), accuracy of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.76-0.77), precision of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.66-0.69), and AUC-ROC of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.81-0.83). The model exhibits strong predictive performance and offers insights into the factors that influence prolonged hospital stays. This makes it a valuable tool for hospital management and for developing future intervention studies aimed at reducing pLoS.

Abstract: The field of learning analytics has made notable strides in automating the detection of complex learning processes in multimodal data. However, most advancements have focused on individualized problem-solving instead of collaborative, open-ended problem-solving, which may offer both affordances (richer data) and challenges (low cohesion) to behavioral prediction. Here, we extend predictive models to automatically detect socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) behaviors in collaborative computational modeling environments using embedding-based approaches. We leverage large language models (LLMs) as summarization tools to generate task-aware representations of student dialogue aligned with system logs. These summaries, combined with text-only embeddings, context-enriched embeddings, and log-derived features, were used to train predictive models. Results show that text-only embeddings often achieve stronger performance in detecting SSRL behaviors related to enactment or group dynamics (e.g., off-task behavior or requesting assistance). In contrast, contextual and multimodal features provide complementary benefits for constructs such as planning and reflection. Overall, our findings highlight the promise of embedding-based models for extending learning analytics by enabling scalable detection of SSRL behaviors, ultimately supporting real-time feedback and adaptive scaffolding in collaborative learning environments that teachers value.

Abstract: While probabilistic graphical models can discover latent structure in data, their effectiveness hinges on choosing well-specified models. Identifying such models is challenging in practice, often requiring iterative checking and revision through trial and error. To this end, we propose meta-probabilistic modeling (MPM), a meta-learning algorithm that learns generative model structure directly from multiple related datasets. MPM uses a hierarchical architecture where global model specifications are shared across datasets while local parameters remain dataset-specific. For learning and inference, we propose a tractable VAE-inspired surrogate objective, and optimize it through bi-level optimization: local variables are updated analytically via coordinate ascent, while global parameters are trained with gradient-based methods. We evaluate MPM on object-centric image modeling and sequential text modeling, demonstrating that it adapts generative models to data while recovering meaningful latent representations.

Abstract: Language models can perceive visual properties of text despite receiving only sequences of tokens-we mechanistically investigate how Claude 3.5 Haiku accomplishes one such task: linebreaking in fixed-width text. We find that character counts are represented on low-dimensional curved manifolds discretized by sparse feature families, analogous to biological place cells. Accurate predictions emerge from a sequence of geometric transformations: token lengths are accumulated into character count manifolds, attention heads twist these manifolds to estimate distance to the line boundary, and the decision to break the line is enabled by arranging estimates orthogonally to create a linear decision boundary. We validate our findings through causal interventions and discover visual illusions--character sequences that hijack the counting mechanism. Our work demonstrates the rich sensory processing of early layers, the intricacy of attention algorithms, and the importance of combining feature-based and geometric views of interpretability.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) and federated distillation (FD) are distributed learning paradigms that train UE models with enhanced privacy, each offering different trade-offs between noise robustness and learning speed. To mitigate their respective weaknesses, we propose a hybrid federated learning (HFL) framework in which each user equipment (UE) transmits either gradients or logits, and the base station (BS) selects the per-round weights of FL and FD updates. We derive convergence of HFL framework and introduce two methods to exploit degrees of freedom (DoF) in HFL, which are (i) adaptive UE clustering via Jenks optimization and (ii) adaptive weight selection via a damped Newton method. Numerical results show that HFL achieves superior test accuracy at low SNR when both DoF are exploited.

Abstract: Infographics are composite visual artifacts that combine data visualizations with textual and illustrative elements to communicate information. While recent text-to-image (T2I) models can generate aesthetically appealing images, their reliability in generating infographics remains unclear. Generated infographics may appear correct at first glance but contain easily overlooked issues, such as distorted data encoding or incorrect textual content. We present IGENBENCH, the first benchmark for evaluating the reliability of text-to-infographic generation, comprising 600 curated test cases spanning 30 infographic types. We design an automated evaluation framework that decomposes reliability verification into atomic yes/no questions based on a taxonomy of 10 question types. We employ multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to verify each question, yielding question-level accuracy (Q-ACC) and infographic-level accuracy (I-ACC). We comprehensively evaluate 10 state-of-the-art T2I models on IGENBENCH. Our systematic analysis reveals key insights for future model development: (i) a three-tier performance hierarchy with the top model achieving Q-ACC of 0.90 but I-ACC of only 0.49; (ii) data-related dimensions emerging as universal bottlenecks (e.g., Data Completeness: 0.21); and (iii) the challenge of achieving end-to-end correctness across all models.

Abstract: Therapeutic peptides show promise in targeting previously undruggable binding sites, with recent advancements in deep generative models enabling full-atom peptide co-design for specific protein receptors. However, the critical role of molecular surfaces in protein-protein interactions (PPIs) has been underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an omni-design peptides generation paradigm, called SurfFlow, a novel surface-based generative algorithm that enables comprehensive co-design of sequence, structure, and surface for peptides. SurfFlow employs a multi-modality conditional flow matching (CFM) architecture to learn distributions of surface geometries and biochemical properties, enhancing peptide binding accuracy. Evaluated on the comprehensive PepMerge benchmark, SurfFlow consistently outperforms full-atom baselines across all metrics. These results highlight the advantages of considering molecular surfaces in de novo peptide discovery and demonstrate the potential of integrating multiple protein modalities for more effective therapeutic peptide discovery.

TL;DR: 本文发现RLVR训练中LLMs的行为呈现强烈线性特征，提出了基于权重和外推的加速方法，可大幅减少计算资源需求。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR训练需要大量计算资源，主要用于漫长的探索过程。作者观察到RLVR训练过程中LLMs展现强线性演化特征，这为通过外推预测未来模型状态、避免持续训练提供了可能。

Method: 1. 发现RL训练中模型权重和输出log-probabilities与训练步数呈现强线性相关性；2. 提出Weight Extrapolation方法，从中途检查点外推预测未来模型权重；3. 提出Logits Extrapolation方法，超越RL训练稳定步数范围进行外推。

Result: 1. Weight Extrapolation方法可达到与标准RL训练相当的模型性能，同时显著减少计算需求；2. Logits Extrapolation方法在四个基准测试中均超越持续RL训练效果。

Conclusion: RLVR训练的主要作用是放大在训练早期出现的行为趋势，而非在整个优化轨迹中持续发现新行为。基于线性特征的外推方法可有效加速RLVR训练，大幅降低计算成本，且Logits Extrapolation甚至能超越原始训练效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a central component of large language model (LLM) post-training. Unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT), RLVR lets an LLM generate multiple candidate solutions and reinforces those that lead to a verifiably correct final answer. However, in practice, RLVR often requires thousands of training steps to reach strong performance, incurring substantial computation largely attributed to prolonged exploration. In this work, we make a surprising observation: during RLVR, LLMs evolve in a strongly linear manner. Specifically, both model weights and model output log-probabilities exhibit strong linear correlations with RL training steps. This suggests that RLVR predominantly amplifies trends that emerge early in training, rather than continuously discovering new behaviors throughout the entire optimization trajectory. Motivated by this linearity, we investigate whether future model states can be predicted from intermediate checkpoints via extrapolation, avoiding continued expensive training. We show that Weight Extrapolation produces models with performance comparable to standard RL training while requiring significantly less computation. Moreover, Logits Extrapolation consistently outperforms continued RL training on all four benchmarks by extrapolating beyond the step range where RL training remains stable.

Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization, intelligent transportation systems have an increasing demand for accurate traffic flow prediction. This paper proposes a novel Graph Enhanced Spatio-temporal Hierarchical Inference Network (GEnSHIN) to handle the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic flow prediction. The model integrates three innovative designs: 1) An attention-enhanced Graph Convolutional Recurrent Unit (GCRU), which strengthens the modeling capability for long-term temporal dependencies by introducing Transformer modules; 2) An asymmetric dual-embedding graph generation mechanism, which leverages the real road network and data-driven latent asymmetric topology to generate graph structures that better fit the characteristics of actual traffic flow; 3) A dynamic memory bank module, which utilizes learnable traffic pattern prototypes to provide personalized traffic pattern representations for each sensor node, and introduces a lightweight graph updater during the decoding phase to adapt to dynamic changes in road network states. Extensive experiments on the public dataset METR-LA show that GEnSHIN achieves or surpasses the performance of comparative models across multiple metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Notably, the model demonstrates excellent prediction stability during peak morning and evening traffic hours. Ablation experiments further validate the effectiveness of each core module and its contribution to the final performance.

Motivation: 传统半监督对比学习方法仅对最高预测类别概率超过预定义阈值的样本分配伪标签，这种方法会排除大量有用样本，限制了模型的学习潜力。

Method: 设计了新的损失函数，基于样本预测概率分布的熵来估计置信度，并应用置信度自适应的加权机制。该方法允许对之前被排除的样本也分配伪标签，并以更原则化的方式考虑锚样本和正样本的置信度进行对比学习。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法在低标签条件下提高了分类精度，并实现了更稳定的学习性能。

Conclusion: 基于信息熵的置信度估计和自适应加权策略能够更有效地利用半监督数据，改善半监督对比学习效果。

Abstract: Conventional semi-supervised contrastive learning methods assign pseudo-labels only to samples whose highest predicted class probability exceeds a predefined threshold, and then perform supervised contrastive learning using those selected samples. In this study, we propose a novel loss function that estimates the confidence of each sample based on the entropy of its predicted probability distribution and applies confidence-based adaptive weighting. This approach enables pseudo-label assignment even to samples that were previously excluded from training and facilitates contrastive learning that accounts for the confidence of both anchor and positive samples in a more principled manner. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves classification accuracy and achieves more stable learning performance even under low-label conditions.

Abstract: Our experience of the world is multisensory, spanning a synthesis of language, sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. Yet, artificial intelligence has primarily advanced in digital modalities like text, vision, and audio. This paper outlines a research vision for multisensory artificial intelligence over the next decade. This new set of technologies can change how humans and AI experience and interact with one another, by connecting AI to the human senses and a rich spectrum of signals from physiological and tactile cues on the body, to physical and social signals in homes, cities, and the environment. We outline how this field must advance through three interrelated themes of sensing, science, and synergy. Firstly, research in sensing should extend how AI captures the world in richer ways beyond the digital medium. Secondly, developing a principled science for quantifying multimodal heterogeneity and interactions, developing unified modeling architectures and representations, and understanding cross-modal transfer. Finally, we present new technical challenges to learn synergy between modalities and between humans and AI, covering multisensory integration, alignment, reasoning, generation, generalization, and experience. Accompanying this vision paper are a series of projects, resources, and demos of latest advances from the Multisensory Intelligence group at the MIT Media Lab, see https://mit-mi.github.io/.

Abstract: Imputing missing values in spatial-temporal traffic data is essential for intelligent transportation systems. Among advanced imputation methods, score-based diffusion models have demonstrated competitive performance. These models generate data by reversing a noising process, using observed values as conditional guidance. However, existing diffusion models typically apply a uniform guidance scale across both spatial and temporal dimensions, which is inadequate for nodes with high missing data rates. Sparse observations provide insufficient conditional guidance, causing the generative process to drift toward the learned prior distribution rather than closely following the conditional observations, resulting in suboptimal imputation performance.
  To address this, we propose FENCE, a spatial-temporal feedback diffusion guidance method designed to adaptively control guidance scales during imputation. First, FENCE introduces a dynamic feedback mechanism that adjusts the guidance scale based on the posterior likelihood approximations. The guidance scale is increased when generated values diverge from observations and reduced when alignment improves, preventing overcorrection. Second, because alignment to observations varies across nodes and denoising steps, a global guidance scale for all nodes is suboptimal. FENCE computes guidance scales at the cluster level by grouping nodes based on their attention scores, leveraging spatial-temporal correlations to provide more accurate guidance. Experimental results on real-world traffic datasets show that FENCE significantly enhances imputation accuracy.

Abstract: This paper introduces FedKDX, a federated learning framework that addresses limitations in healthcare AI through Negative Knowledge Distillation (NKD). Unlike existing approaches that focus solely on positive knowledge transfer, FedKDX captures both target and non-target information to improve model generalization in healthcare applications. The framework integrates multiple knowledge transfer techniques--including traditional knowledge distillation, contrastive learning, and NKD--within a unified architecture that maintains privacy while reducing communication costs. Through experiments on healthcare datasets (SLEEP, UCI-HAR, and PAMAP2), FedKDX demonstrates improved accuracy (up to 2.53% over state-of-the-art methods), faster convergence, and better performance on non-IID data distributions. Theoretical analysis supports NKD's contribution to addressing statistical heterogeneity in distributed healthcare data. The approach shows promise for privacy-sensitive medical applications under regulatory frameworks like HIPAA and GDPR, offering a balanced solution between performance and practical implementation requirements in decentralized healthcare settings.

Abstract: Modeling human decision-making is central to applications such as recommendation, preference learning, and human-AI alignment. While many classic models assume context-independent choice behavior, a large body of behavioral research shows that preferences are often influenced by the composition of the choice set itself -- a phenomenon known as the context effect or Halo effect. These effects can manifest as pairwise (first-order) or even higher-order interactions among the available alternatives. Recent models that attempt to capture such effects either focus on the featureless setting or, in the feature-based setting, rely on restrictive interaction structures or entangle interactions across all orders, which limits interpretability. In this work, we propose DeepHalo, a neural modeling framework that incorporates features while enabling explicit control over interaction order and principled interpretation of context effects. Our model enables systematic identification of interaction effects by order and serves as a universal approximator of context-dependent choice functions when specialized to a featureless setting. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate strong predictive performance while providing greater transparency into the drivers of choice.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training is a critical stage in modern language model development, playing a key role in improving alignment and reasoning ability. However, several phenomena remain poorly understood, including the reduction in output diversity. To gain a broader understanding of RL post-training, we analyze the learning dynamics of RL post-training from a perspective that has been studied in supervised learning but remains underexplored in RL. We adopt an empirical neural tangent kernel (NTK) framework and decompose the NTK into two components to characterize how RL updates propagate across training samples. Our analysis reveals that limited variability in feature representations can cause RL updates to systematically increase model confidence, providing an explanation for the commonly observed reduction in output diversity after RL post-training. Furthermore, we show that effective learning in this regime depends on rapidly shaping the classifier, which directly affects the gradient component of the NTK. Motivated by these insights, we propose classifier-first reinforcement learning (CF-RL), a simple two-stage training strategy that prioritizes classifier updates before standard RL optimization. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis by demonstrating increased model confidence and accelerated optimization under CF-RL. Additional analysis shows that the mechanism underlying CF-RL differs from that of linear-probing-then-fine-tuning in supervised learning. Overall, our study formalizes the learning dynamics of RL post-training and motivates further analysis and improvement.

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from observational data remains a fundamental challenge in causal inference, especially in the presence of latent confounders. This paper focuses on estimating causal effects in Gaussian Linear Structural Causal Models (GL-SCMs), which are widely used due to their analytical tractability. However, parameter estimation in GL-SCMs is often infeasible with finite data, primarily due to overparameterization. To address this, we introduce the class of Centralized Gaussian Linear SCMs (CGL-SCMs), a simplified yet expressive subclass where exogenous variables follow standardized distributions. We show that CGL-SCMs are equally expressive in terms of causal effect identifiability from observational distributions and present a novel EM-based estimation algorithm that can learn CGL-SCM parameters and estimate identifiable causal effects from finite observational samples. Our theoretical analysis is validated through experiments on synthetic data and benchmark causal graphs, demonstrating that the learned models accurately recover causal distributions.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的推荐系统主要依赖文本语义，协同信号利用有限（仅使用用户或物品嵌入），难以处理用户历史中的多个物品嵌入，常退回到纯文本语义而忽略更丰富的协同信息

Method: 通过独立的轻量级投影器模块将协同过滤学习到的用户和物品嵌入投影到LLM令牌空间，微调LLM同时基于投影嵌入和文本令牌生成推荐

Result: 初步结果表明这种设计能有效利用结构化用户-物品交互数据，相比纯文本LLM基线方法改善了推荐性能

Conclusion: 该方法为传统推荐系统与现代LLMs架起了一座实用桥梁，通过简单有效的设计融合了协同过滤嵌入与LLM的文本理解能力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising recommendation systems, offering novel ways to model user preferences through generative approaches. However, many existing methods often rely solely on text semantics or incorporate collaborative signals in a limited manner, typically using only user or item embeddings. These methods struggle to handle multiple item embeddings representing user history, reverting to textual semantics and neglecting richer collaborative information. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective solution that projects user and item embeddings, learned from collaborative filtering, into the LLM token space via separate lightweight projector modules. A finetuned LLM then conditions on these projected embeddings alongside textual tokens to generate recommendations. Preliminary results show that this design effectively leverages structured user-item interaction data, improves recommendation performance over text-only LLM baselines, and offers a practical path for bridging traditional recommendation systems with modern LLMs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型推理时KV缓存的内存占用随序列长度线性增长，常超过模型权重本身，成为显著内存瓶颈，需要高效压缩方案

Method: 实现GPU加速的INT8 KV缓存量化，开发了四种CUDA内核变体（naive、tiled、coarsened、vectorized），在10亿元素规模下进行基准测试，量化过程保持极低的数值误差

Result: 向量化内核相比CPU基线实现高达1694倍加速，重构误差低于0.004，注意力分数误差低于0.1（即使对于8K维头），仅增加6-58ms计算开销，内存减少4倍

Conclusion: INT8量化为LLM推理中的内存压力提供了实用解决方案，计算开销可忽略且对下游模型行为影响最小

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in large language models presents a significant memory bottleneck during inference, growing linearly with sequence length and often exceeding the memory footprint of model weights themselves. We implement and evaluate GPU-accelerated INT8 quantization for KV cache compression, achieving 4$\times$ memory reduction with minimal accuracy degradation. We develop four CUDA kernel variants -- naive, tiled, coarsened, and vectorized -- and benchmark them across realistic workload sizes up to 1 billion elements. Our vectorized kernel achieves up to 1,694$\times$ speedup over CPU baselines while maintaining reconstruction error below 0.004 and attention score error below 0.1 even for 8K-dimensional heads. These results demonstrate that INT8 quantization provides a practical approach for reducing memory pressure in LLM inference with negligible computational overhead (6--58ms) and minimal impact on downstream model behavior

Abstract: Understanding whether fine-tuning elicits latent capabilities or teaches new ones is a fundamental question for language model evaluation and safety. We develop a formal information-theoretic framework for quantifying how much predictive structure fine-tuning extracts from the train dataset and writes into a model's parameters. Our central quantity, Excess Description Length (EDL), is defined via prequential coding and measures the gap between the bits required to encode training labels sequentially using an evolving model (trained online) and the residual encoding cost under the final trained model. We establish that EDL is non-negative in expectation, converges to surplus description length in the infinite-data limit, and provides bounds on expected generalization gain. Through a series of toy models, we clarify common confusions about information in learning: why random labels yield EDL near zero, how a single example can eliminate many bits of uncertainty about the underlying rule(s) that describe the data distribution, why structure learned on rare inputs contributes proportionally little to expected generalization, and how format learning creates early transients distinct from capability acquisition. This framework provides rigorous foundations for the empirical observation that capability elicitation and teaching exhibit qualitatively distinct scaling signatures.

Abstract: Given real-time sensor data streams obtained from machines, how can we continuously predict when a machine failure will occur? This work aims to continuously forecast the timing of future events by analyzing multi-sensor data streams. A key characteristic of real-world data streams is their dynamic nature, where the underlying patterns evolve over time. To address this, we present TimeCast, a dynamic prediction framework designed to adapt to these changes and provide accurate, real-time predictions of future event time. Our proposed method has the following properties: (a) Dynamic: it identifies the distinct time-evolving patterns (i.e., stages) and learns individual models for each, enabling us to make adaptive predictions based on pattern shifts. (b) Practical: it finds meaningful stages that capture time-varying interdependencies between multiple sensors and improve prediction performance; (c) Scalable: our algorithm scales linearly with the input size and enables online model updates on data streams. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that TimeCast provides higher prediction accuracy than state-of-the-art methods while finding dynamic changes in data streams with a great reduction in computational time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对时空光伏功率预报的全国性评估，缺少评估不同预报模型在可靠度、精确度和整体性能对比的标准化框架，需要填补在全国尺度下的太阳能辐射场预报系统评估的空白并提供对天气系统影响光伏发电的可视化分析。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的时空光伏功率预报评估框架，集成卫星衍生的地面太阳辐照度数据，并将其通过站点特定的机器学习模型转换为光伏功率，用于评估7种预报模型在覆盖6434个瑞士光伏电站的生产数据上的表现。

Result: 基于卫星的预报方法在短预报时段明显优于集成预报系统，特别是SolarSTEPS和SHADECast提供的SSI和光伏功率预测最为准确，SHADECast还提供了最可靠的集合预报分布。在空间分布上预报能力随海拔增高而下降，卫星模型在82%的2019-2020年日数内能以低于10%相对误差预测全国日总光伏发电量。

Conclusion: 卫星驱动的光伏功率预报方法在全国尺度具有良好的操作应用潜力，特别适合临近预报，而基于机器学习的确定性模型在均方根误差方面最优，概率性预报模型在不确定性校准方面更佳，为电网运营提供了可靠的量化结果和可视化分析支持。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for spatiotemporal photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting and use it to evaluate the reliability, sharpness, and overall performance of seven intraday PV power nowcasting models. The model suite includes satellite-based deep learning and optical-flow approaches and physics-based numerical weather prediction models, covering both deterministic and probabilistic formulations. Forecasts are first validated against satellite-derived surface solar irradiance (SSI). Irradiance fields are then converted into PV power using station-specific machine learning models, enabling comparison with production data from 6434 PV stations across Switzerland. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate spatiotemporal PV forecasting at a national scale. We additionally provide the first visualizations of how mesoscale cloud systems shape national PV production on hourly and sub-hourly timescales. Our results show that satellite-based approaches outperform the Integrated Forecast System (IFS-ENS), particularly at short lead times. Among them, SolarSTEPS and SHADECast deliver the most accurate SSI and PV power predictions, with SHADECast providing the most reliable ensemble spread. The deterministic model IrradianceNet achieves the lowest root mean square error, while probabilistic forecasts of SolarSTEPS and SHADECast provide better-calibrated uncertainty. Forecast skill generally decreases with elevation. At a national scale, satellite-based models forecast the daily total PV generation with relative errors below 10% for 82% of the days in 2019-2020, demonstrating robustness and their potential for operational use.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable agentic systems trained with reinforcement learning (RL) over multi-turn interaction trajectories, but practical deployment is bottlenecked by rapidly growing textual histories that inflate token budgets and memory usage. We introduce AgentOCR, a framework that exploits the superior information density of visual tokens by representing the accumulated observation-action history as a compact rendered image. To make multi-turn rollouts scalable, AgentOCR proposes segment optical caching. By decomposing history into hashable segments and maintaining a visual cache, this mechanism eliminates redundant re-rendering. Beyond fixed rendering, AgentOCR introduces agentic self-compression, where the agent actively emits a compression rate and is trained with compression-aware reward to adaptively balance task success and token efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on challenging agentic benchmarks, ALFWorld and search-based QA. Remarkably, results demonstrate that AgentOCR preserves over 95\% of text-based agent performance while substantially reducing token consumption (>50\%), yielding consistent token and memory efficiency. Our further analysis validates a 20x rendering speedup from segment optical caching and the effective strategic balancing of self-compression.

Abstract: Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a promising approach for combining the learning capabilities of neural networks with the interpretable reasoning of symbolic systems. However, existing NeSy frameworks typically require either predefined symbolic policies or policies that are differentiable, limiting their applicability when domain expertise is unavailable or when policies are inherently non-differentiable. We propose a framework that addresses this limitation by enabling the concurrent learning of both non-differentiable symbolic policies and neural network weights through an evolutionary process. Our approach casts NeSy systems as organisms in a population that evolve through mutations (both symbolic rule additions and neural weight changes), with fitness-based selection guiding convergence toward hidden target policies. The framework extends the NEUROLOG architecture to make symbolic policies trainable, adapts Valiant's Evolvability framework to the NeSy context, and employs Machine Coaching semantics for mutable symbolic representations. Neural networks are trained through abductive reasoning from the symbolic component, eliminating differentiability requirements. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that NeSy systems starting with empty policies and random neural weights can successfully approximate hidden non-differentiable target policies, achieving median correct performance approaching 100%. This work represents a step toward enabling NeSy research in domains where the acquisition of symbolic knowledge from experts is challenging or infeasible.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in a wide range of tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, by exploiting the structural information in graph-structured data. However, in node classification, computing node-level explainability becomes extremely time-consuming as the size of the graph increases, while batching strategies often degrade explanation quality. This paper introduces a novel approach to parallelizing node-level explainability in GNNs through graph partitioning. By decomposing the graph into disjoint subgraphs, we enable parallel computation of explainability for node neighbors, significantly improving the scalability and efficiency without affecting the correctness of the results, provided sufficient memory is available. For scenarios where memory is limited, we further propose a dropout-based reconstruction mechanism that offers a controllable trade-off between memory usage and explanation fidelity. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial speedups, enabling scalable and transparent explainability for large-scale GNN models.

Abstract: Handling missing node features is a key challenge for deploying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in real-world domains such as healthcare and sensor networks. Existing studies mostly address relatively benign scenarios, namely benchmark datasets with (a) high-dimensional but sparse node features and (b) incomplete data generated under Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) mechanisms. For (a), we theoretically prove that high sparsity substantially limits the information loss caused by missingness, making all models appear robust and preventing a meaningful comparison of their performance. To overcome this limitation, we introduce one synthetic and three real-world datasets with dense, semantically meaningful features. For (b), we move beyond MCAR and design evaluation protocols with more realistic missingness mechanisms. Moreover, we provide a theoretical background to state explicit assumptions on the missingness process and analyze their implications for different methods. Building on this analysis, we propose GNNmim, a simple yet effective baseline for node classification with incomplete feature data. Experiments show that GNNmim is competitive with respect to specialized architectures across diverse datasets and missingness regimes.

Abstract: Electrospinning is a scalable technique for producing fibrous scaffolds with tunable micro- and nanoscale architectures for applications in tissue engineering, drug delivery, and wound care. While machine learning (ML) has been used to support electrospinning process optimisation, most existing approaches predict only mean fibre diameters, neglecting the full diameter distribution that governs scaffold performance. This work presents FibreCastML, an open, distribution-aware ML framework that predicts complete fibre diameter spectra from routinely reported electrospinning parameters and provides interpretable insights into process structure relationships.
  A meta-dataset comprising 68538 individual fibre diameter measurements extracted from 1778 studies across 16 biomedical polymers was curated. Six standard processing parameters, namely solution concentration, applied voltage, flow rate, tip to collector distance, needle diameter, and collector rotation speed, were used to train seven ML models using nested cross validation with leave one study out external folds. Model interpretability was achieved using variable importance analysis, SHapley Additive exPlanations, correlation matrices, and three dimensional parameter maps.
  Non linear models consistently outperformed linear baselines, achieving coefficients of determination above 0.91 for several widely used polymers. Solution concentration emerged as the dominant global driver of fibre diameter distributions. Experimental validation across different electrospinning systems demonstrated close agreement between predicted and measured distributions. FibreCastML enables more reproducible and data driven optimisation of electrospun scaffold architectures.

TL;DR: 论文提出在大型语言模型预训练中，通过引入可学习的乘法器来优化权重矩阵的尺度，取代传统权重衰减产生的固定均衡范数，从而提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统权重衰减（WD）与随机梯度噪声相互作用会在权重矩阵中形成固定的均衡范数，作者认为这种固定的范数尺度是训练过程中的有害产物，可能限制了模型表达能力和性能提升空间，需要引入更灵活的尺度调节机制。

Method: 1. 首先在权重矩阵W上添加可学习的标量乘法器，验证WD-noise均衡范数的次优性；2. 其次考虑行和列范数同样受限，引入可学习的逐行和逐列乘法器来释放尺度约束；3. 该方法可视为muP乘法器的更通用、更具表达能力的可学习版本，同时验证了与Adam和Muon优化器的兼容性。

Result: 1. 可学习尺度能自适应数据分布，提升模型性能；2. 优于经过良好调优的muP基线；3. 减少了乘法器调优的计算开销；4. 揭示了前向传递对称性和所学乘法器的宽度缩放等实用问题；5. 在Adam和Muon优化器上均有效，下游评估指标改善幅度相当于从Adam切换到Muon的增益。

Conclusion: 引入可学习的行、列、标量乘法器能有效替代传统权重衰减形成的固定尺度约束，是一种灵活的权重尺度优化方法，显著提升大型语言模型预训练的性能，且与多种优化器兼容，具有重要的实践价值。

Abstract: Applying weight decay (WD) to matrix layers is standard practice in large-language-model pretraining. Prior work suggests that stochastic gradient noise induces a Brownian-like expansion of the weight matrices W, whose growth is counteracted by WD, leading to a WD-noise equilibrium with a certain weight norm ||W||. In this work, we view the equilibrium norm as a harmful artifact of the training procedure, and address it by introducing learnable multipliers to learn the optimal scale. First, we attach a learnable scalar multiplier to W and confirm that the WD-noise equilibrium norm is suboptimal: the learned scale adapts to data and improves performance. We then argue that individual row and column norms are similarly constrained, and free their scale by introducing learnable per-row and per-column multipliers. Our method can be viewed as a learnable, more expressive generalization of muP multipliers. It outperforms a well-tuned muP baseline, reduces the computational overhead of multiplier tuning, and surfaces practical questions such as forward-pass symmetries and the width-scaling of the learned multipliers. Finally, we validate learnable multipliers with both Adam and Muon optimizers, where it shows improvement in downstream evaluations matching the improvement of the switching from Adam to Muon.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate distributed online convex optimization with compressed communication, where $n$ learners connected by a network collaboratively minimize a sequence of global loss functions using only local information and compressed data from neighbors. Prior work has established regret bounds of $O(\max\{ω^{-2}ρ^{-4}n^{1/2},ω^{-4}ρ^{-8}\}n\sqrt{T})$ and $O(\max\{ω^{-2}ρ^{-4}n^{1/2},ω^{-4}ρ^{-8}\}n\ln{T})$ for convex and strongly convex functions, respectively, where $ω\in(0,1]$ is the compression quality factor ($ω=1$ means no compression) and $ρ<1$ is the spectral gap of the communication matrix. However, these regret bounds suffer from a \emph{quadratic} or even \emph{quartic} dependence on $ω^{-1}$. Moreover, the \emph{super-linear} dependence on $n$ is also undesirable. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel algorithm that achieves improved regret bounds of $\tilde{O}(ω^{-1/2}ρ^{-1}n\sqrt{T})$ and $\tilde{O}(ω^{-1}ρ^{-2}n\ln{T})$ for convex and strongly convex functions, respectively. The primary idea is to design a \emph{two-level blocking update framework} incorporating two novel ingredients: an online gossip strategy and an error compensation scheme, which collaborate to \emph{achieve a better consensus} among learners. Furthermore, we establish the first lower bounds for this problem, justifying the optimality of our results with respect to both $ω$ and $T$. Additionally, we consider the bandit feedback scenario, and extend our method with the classic gradient estimators to enhance existing regret bounds.

Abstract: Class imbalance is a common and pernicious issue for the training of neural networks. Often, an imbalanced majority class can dominate training to skew classifier performance towards the majority outcome. To address this problem we introduce cardinality augmented loss functions, derived from cardinality-like invariants in modern mathematics literature such as magnitude and the spread. These invariants enrich the concept of cardinality by evaluating the `effective diversity' of a metric space, and as such represent a natural solution to overly homogeneous training data. In this work, we establish a methodology for applying cardinality augmented loss functions in the training of neural networks and report results on both artificially imbalanced datasets as well as a real-world imbalanced material science dataset. We observe significant performance improvement among minority classes, as well as improvement in overall performance metrics.

Abstract: A central belief in scaling reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards for instruction following (IF) tasks is that, a diverse mixture of verifiable hard and unverifiable soft constraints is essential for generalizing to unseen instructions. In this work, we challenge this prevailing consensus through a systematic empirical investigation. Counter-intuitively, we find that models trained on hard-only constraints consistently outperform those trained on mixed datasets. Extensive experiments reveal that reward precision, rather than constraint diversity, is the primary driver of effective alignment. The LLM judge suffers from a low recall rate in detecting false response, which leads to severe reward hacking, thereby undermining the benefits of diversity. Furthermore, analysis of the attention mechanism reveals that high-precision rewards develop a transferable meta-skill for IF. Motivated by these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data-centric refinement strategy that prioritizes reward precision. Evaluated on five benchmarks, our approach outperforms competitive baselines by 13.4\% in performance while achieving a 58\% reduction in training time, maintaining strong generalization beyond instruction following. Our findings advocate for a paradigm shift: moving away from the indiscriminate pursuit of data diversity toward high-precision rewards.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations are widely used to communicate how inputs must change for a model to alter its prediction. For a single instance, many valid counterfactuals can exist, which leaves open the possibility for an explanation provider to cherry-pick explanations that better suit a narrative of their choice, highlighting favourable behaviour and withholding examples that reveal problematic behaviour. We formally define cherry-picking for counterfactual explanations in terms of an admissible explanation space, specified by the generation procedure, and a utility function. We then study to what extent an external auditor can detect such manipulation. Considering three levels of access to the explanation process: full procedural access, partial procedural access, and explanation-only access, we show that detection is extremely limited in practice. Even with full procedural access, cherry-picked explanations can remain difficult to distinguish from non cherry-picked explanations, because the multiplicity of valid counterfactuals and flexibility in the explanation specification provide sufficient degrees of freedom to mask deliberate selection. Empirically, we demonstrate that this variability often exceeds the effect of cherry-picking on standard counterfactual quality metrics such as proximity, plausibility, and sparsity, making cherry-picked explanations statistically indistinguishable from baseline explanations. We argue that safeguards should therefore prioritise reproducibility, standardisation, and procedural constraints over post-hoc detection, and we provide recommendations for algorithm developers, explanation providers, and auditors.

Abstract: Missing value imputation is a fundamental challenge in machine intelligence, heavily dependent on data completeness. Current imputation methods often handle numerical and categorical attributes independently, overlooking critical interdependencies among heterogeneous features. To address these limitations, we propose a novel imputation approach that explicitly models cross-type feature dependencies within a unified framework. Our method leverages both complete and incomplete instances to ensure accurate and consistent imputation in tabular data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance over existing techniques and significantly enhances downstream machine learning tasks, providing a robust solution for real-world systems with missing data.

Abstract: Equivariance is a powerful inductive bias in neural networks, improving generalisation and physical consistency. Recently, however, non-equivariant models have regained attention, due to their better runtime performance and imperfect symmetries that might arise in real-world applications. This has motivated the development of approximately equivariant models that strike a middle ground between respecting symmetries and fitting the data distribution. Existing approaches in this field usually apply sample-based regularisers which depend on data augmentation at training time, incurring a high sample complexity, in particular for continuous groups such as $SO(3)$. This work instead approaches approximate equivariance via a projection-based regulariser which leverages the orthogonal decomposition of linear layers into equivariant and non-equivariant components. In contrast to existing methods, this penalises non-equivariance at an operator level across the full group orbit, rather than point-wise. We present a mathematical framework for computing the non-equivariance penalty exactly and efficiently in both the spatial and spectral domain. In our experiments, our method consistently outperforms prior approximate equivariance approaches in both model performance and efficiency, achieving substantial runtime gains over sample-based regularisers.

Abstract: Demand forecasting in supply chain management (SCM) is critical for optimizing inventory, reducing waste, and improving customer satisfaction. Conventional approaches frequently neglect external influences like weather, festivities, and equipment breakdowns, resulting in inefficiencies. This research investigates the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms to improve demand prediction in retail and vending machine sectors. Four machine learning algorithms. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Facebook Prophet (Fb Prophet), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were used to forecast inventory requirements. Ex-ternal factors like weekdays, holidays, and sales deviation indicators were methodically incorporated to enhance precision. XGBoost surpassed other models, reaching the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 22.7 with the inclusion of external variables. ARIMAX and Fb Prophet demonstrated noteworthy enhancements, whereas SVR fell short in performance. Incorporating external factors greatly improves the precision of demand forecasting models, and XGBoost is identified as the most efficient algorithm. This study offers a strong framework for enhancing inventory management in retail and vending machine systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with complex geometric reasoning, largely because "black box" outcome-based supervision fails to distinguish between lucky guesses and rigorous deduction. To address this, we introduce a paradigm shift towards subgoal-level evaluation and learning. We first construct GeoGoal, a benchmark synthesized via a rigorous formal verification data engine, which converts abstract proofs into verifiable numeric subgoals. This structure reveals a critical divergence between reasoning quality and outcome accuracy. Leveraging this, we propose the Sub-Goal Verifiable Reward (SGVR) framework, which replaces sparse signals with dense rewards based on the Skeleton Rate. Experiments demonstrate that SGVR not only enhances geometric performance (+9.7%) but also exhibits strong generalization, transferring gains to general math (+8.0%) and other general reasoning tasks (+2.8%), demonstrating broad applicability across diverse domains.

On the other hand, the collection of data requires to comply with the growing demand regarding privacy legislation. In this paper, we use the Student Expectation of Learning Analytics Questionnaire (SELAQ) to analyze the expectations and confidence of students from different faculties regarding the processing of their data for Learning Analytics purposes. This allows us to identify four clusters of students through clustering algorithms: Enthusiasts, Realists, Cautious and Indifferents. This structured analysis provides valuable insights into the acceptance and criticism of Learning Analytics among students.

Abstract: Certified unlearning based on differential privacy offers strong guarantees but remains largely impractical: the noisy fine-tuning approaches proposed so far achieve these guarantees but severely reduce model accuracy. We propose sequential noise scheduling, which distributes the noise budget across orthogonal subspaces of the parameter space, rather than injecting it all at once. This simple modification mitigates the destructive effect of noise while preserving the original certification guarantees. We extend the analysis of noisy fine-tuning to the subspace setting, proving that the same $(\varepsilon,δ)$ privacy budget is retained. Empirical results on image classification benchmarks show that our approach substantially improves accuracy after unlearning while remaining robust to membership inference attacks. These results show that certified unlearning can achieve both rigorous guarantees and practical utility.

Abstract: In this study, we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208 admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models to reweight the JHFRAT scoring weights, while preserving its additive structure and clinical thresholds. Recalibration refers to adjusting item weights so that the resulting score can order encounters more consistently by the study's risk labels, and without changing the tool's form factor or deployment workflow. The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). This performance improvement translates to protecting an additional 35 high-risk patients per week across the Johns Hopkins Health System. The constrained score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression (AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk labeling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

Abstract: We prove tight lower bounds for online multicalibration, establishing an information-theoretic separation from marginal calibration.
  In the general setting where group functions can depend on both context and the learner's predictions, we prove an $Ω(T^{2/3})$ lower bound on expected multicalibration error using just three disjoint binary groups. This matches the upper bounds of Noarov et al. (2025) up to logarithmic factors and exceeds the $O(T^{2/3-\varepsilon})$ upper bound for marginal calibration (Dagan et al., 2025), thereby separating the two problems.
  We then turn to lower bounds for the more difficult case of group functions that may depend on context but not on the learner's predictions. In this case, we establish an $\widetildeΩ(T^{2/3})$ lower bound for online multicalibration via a $Θ(T)$-sized group family constructed using orthogonal function systems, again matching upper bounds up to logarithmic factors.

Abstract: Pull request (PR) review is essential for ensuring software quality, yet automating this task remains challenging due to noisy supervision, limited contextual understanding, and inadequate evaluation metrics. We present Sphinx, a unified framework for LLM-based PR review that addresses these limitations through three key components: (1) a structured data generation pipeline that produces context-rich, semantically grounded review comments by comparing pseudo-modified and merged code; (2) a checklist-based evaluation benchmark that assesses review quality based on structured coverage of actionable verification points, moving beyond surface-level metrics like BLEU; and (3) Checklist Reward Policy Optimization (CRPO), a novel training paradigm that uses rule-based, interpretable rewards to align model behavior with real-world review practices. Extensive experiments show that models trained with Sphinx achieve state-of-the-art performance on review completeness and precision, outperforming both proprietary and open-source baselines by up to 40\% in checklist coverage. Together, Sphinx enables the development of PR review models that are not only fluent but also context-aware, technically precise, and practically deployable in real-world development workflows. The data will be released after review.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have automated various software engineering tasks, with benchmarks emerging to evaluate their capabilities. However, for adaptation, a critical activity during code reuse, there is no benchmark to assess LLMs' performance, leaving their practical utility in this area unclear. To fill this gap, we propose AdaptEval, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on code snippet adaptation. Unlike existing benchmarks, AdaptEval incorporates the following three distinctive features: First, Practical Context. Tasks in AdaptEval are derived from developers' practices, preserving rich contextual information from Stack Overflow and GitHub communities. Second, Multi-granularity Annotation. Each task is annotated with requirements at both task and adaptation levels, supporting the evaluation of LLMs across diverse adaptation scenarios. Third, Fine-grained Evaluation. AdaptEval includes a two-tier testing framework combining adaptation-level and function-level tests, which enables evaluating LLMs' performance across various individual adaptations. Based on AdaptEval, we conduct the first empirical study to evaluate six instruction-tuned LLMs and especially three reasoning LLMs on code snippet adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaptEval enables the assessment of LLMs' adaptation capabilities from various perspectives. It also provides critical insights into their current limitations, particularly their struggle to follow explicit instructions.

Abstract: This paper presents a longitudinal ethical analysis of Untappd, a social drinking application that gamifies beer consumption through badges, streaks, and social sharing. Building on an exploratory study conducted in 2020, we revisit the platform in 2025 to examine how its gamification features and ethical framings have evolved. Drawing on traditional ethical theory and practical frameworks for Software Engineering, we analyze five categories of badges and their implications for user autonomy and well-being. Our findings show that, despite small adjustments and superficial disclaimers, many of the original ethical issues remain. We argue for continuous ethical reflection built embedded into software lifecycles to prevent the normalization of risky behaviors through design.

Abstract: Pull request (PR) descriptions generated by AI coding agents are the primary channel for communicating code changes to human reviewers. However, the alignment between these messages and the actual changes remains unexplored, raising concerns about the trustworthiness of AI agents. To fill this gap, we analyzed 23,247 agentic PRs across five agents using PR message-code inconsistency (PR-MCI). We contributed 974 manually annotated PRs, found 406 PRs (1.7%) exhibited high PR-MCI, and identified eight PR-MCI types, revealing that descriptions claiming unimplemented changes was the most common issue (45.4%). Statistical tests confirmed that high-MCI PRs had 51.7% lower acceptance rates (28.3% vs. 80.0%) and took 3.5x longer to merge (55.8 vs. 16.0 hours). Our findings suggest that unreliable PR descriptions undermine trust in AI agents, highlighting the need for PR-MCI verification mechanisms and improved PR generation to enable trustworthy human-AI collaboration.

TL;DR: 论文提出跨配置基准测试，探究AVX/NEON内在函数在通用开发项目中的能力与限制，为开发者提供基于操作系统、架构和编译器的内在函数使用指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开发者在需要代码向量化优化时，缺乏针对不同操作系统、架构和编译器环境的内在函数使用指导，需要系统评估内在函数在通用开发场景下的实际效益与局限性。

Method: 设计跨配置基准测试框架，在不同操作系统、处理器架构和编译器组合下，对比分析AVX/NEON内在函数与普通代码的执行性能，特别关注条件分支等关键场景。

Result: 内在函数在条件分支处理上表现优异，执行时间可降至普通代码的5%左右；但在多数情况下编译器已能良好自动向量化，使得内在函数的使用变得不必要。

Conclusion: 内在函数在特定场景（如条件分支）能显著提升性能，但在通用开发中应谨慎使用，优先依赖编译器的自动向量化能力，开发者需根据具体环境评估使用必要性。

Abstract: A cross-configuration benchmark is proposed to explore the capacities and limitations of AVX / NEON intrinsic functions in a generic context of development project, when a vectorisation strategy is required to optimise the code. The main aim is to guide developers to choose when using intrinsic functions, depending on the OS, architecture and/or available compiler. Intrinsic functions were observed highly efficient in conditional branching, with intrinsic version execution time reaching around 5% of plain code execution time. However, intrinsic functions were observed as unnecessary in many cases, as the compilers already well auto-vectorise the code.

Abstract: Scientific research increasingly depends on robust and scalable IT infrastructures to support complex computational workflows. With the proliferation of services provided by research infrastructures, NRENs, and commercial cloud providers, researchers must navigate a fragmented ecosystem of computing environments, balancing performance, cost, scalability, and accessibility. Hybrid cloud architectures offer a compelling solution by integrating multiple computing environments to enhance flexibility, resource efficiency, and access to specialised hardware.
  This paper provides a comprehensive overview of hybrid cloud deployment models, focusing on grid and cloud platforms (OpenPBS, SLURM, OpenStack, Kubernetes) and workflow management tools (Nextflow, Snakemake, CWL). We explore strategies for federated computing, multi-cloud orchestration, and workload scheduling, addressing key challenges such as interoperability, data security, reproducibility, and network performance. Drawing on implementations from life sciences, as coordinated by the ELIXIR Compute Platform and their integration into a wider EOSC context, we propose a roadmap for accelerating hybrid cloud adoption in research computing, emphasising governance frameworks and technical solutions that can drive sustainable and scalable infrastructure development.

Abstract: We present a new blocking linearizable stack implementation which utilizes sharding and fetch&increment to achieve significantly better performance than all existing concurrent stacks. The proposed implementation is based on a novel elimination mechanism and a new combining approach that are efficiently blended to gain high performance. Our implementation results in enhanced parallelism and low contention when accessing the shared stack. Experiments show that the proposed stack implementation outperforms all existing concurrent stacks by up to 2X in most workloads. It is particularly efficient in systems supporting a large number of threads and in high contention scenarios.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Permissionless consensus protocols require a scarce resource to regulate leader election and provide Sybil resistance. Existing paradigms such as Proof of Work and Proof of Stake instantiate this scarcity through parallelizable resources like computation or capital. Once acquired, these resources can be subdivided across many identities at negligible marginal cost, making linear Sybil cost fundamentally unattainable.
  We introduce Proof of Commitment (PoCmt), a consensus primitive grounded in a non-parallelizable resource: real-time human engagement. Validators maintain a commitment state capturing cumulative human effort, protocol participation, and online availability. Engagement is enforced through a Human Challenge Oracle that issues identity-bound, time-sensitive challenges, limiting the number of challenges solvable within each human window.
  Under this model, sustaining multiple active identities requires proportional human-time effort. We establish a cost-theoretic separation showing that protocols based on parallelizable resources admit zero marginal Sybil cost, whereas PoCmt enforces a strictly linear cost profile. Using a weighted-backbone analysis, we show that PoCmt achieves safety, liveness, and commitment-proportional fairness under partial synchrony.
  Simulations complement the analysis by isolating human-time capacity as the sole adversarial bottleneck and validating the predicted commitment drift and fairness properties. These results position PoCmt as a new point in the consensus design space, grounding permissionless security in sustained human effort rather than computation or capital.

TL;DR: 该论文提出一个针对恶意汇聚服务器的异步联邦平均方案，结合安全聚合、差分隐私和复制服务器来保护数据隐私，无需共识协议即可保证训练活性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦平均方案在异步通信环境下存在三个主要问题：1) 恶意汇聚服务器可能操纵模型泄露客户端数据或停止计算；2) 快速客户端贡献频率过高导致隐私预算不均和训练偏差；3) 传统共识方法在异步环境中存在可行性限制和延迟敏感问题

Method: 采用三层保护机制：1) 通过复制汇聚服务器容忍部分节点被破坏；2) 客户端使用掩码和加性高斯噪声保护数据，由复制服务器解掩码；3) 引入参与均衡机制确保客户端均匀贡献，平衡隐私预算。系统不依赖一致性协议，避免了异步环境中的共识不可能性问题

Result: 方案在异步恶意环境下实现了与当前最优方案相当的性能，同时提供更强的隐私保护：1) 容忍部分恶意汇聚服务器；2) 保持训练活性免受恶意行为影响；3) 解决了快速客户端导致的隐私和偏差问题；4) 无需共识提高了系统可用性

Conclusion: 该工作首次在异步通信环境中实现了对恶意汇聚服务器的联邦平均，通过创新的复制服务器架构、隐私保护协议和参与均衡机制，在保障隐私的同时避免了共识的限制，为实际部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: Privacy-preserving federated averaging is a central approach for protecting client privacy in federated learning. In this paper, we study this problem in an asynchronous communications setting with malicious aggregators. We propose a new solution to provide federated averaging in this model while protecting the client's data privacy through secure aggregation and differential privacy. Our solution maintains the same performance as the state of the art across all metrics. The main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, unlike existing single- or multi-server solutions, we consider malicious aggregation servers that may manipulate the model to leak clients' data or halt computation. To tolerate this threat, we replicate the aggregators, allowing a fraction of them to be corrupted. Second, we propose a new privacy preservation protocol for protocols in asynchronous communication models with Byzantine aggregators. In this protocol, clients mask their values and add Gaussian noise to their models. In contrast with previous works, we use the replicated servers to unmask the models, while ensuring the liveness of training even if aggregators misbehave. Third, the asynchronous communication model introduces new challenges not present in existing approaches. In such a setting, faster clients may contribute more frequently, potentially reducing their privacy and biasing the training. To address this, we introduce an inclusion mechanism that ensures uniform client participation and balanced privacy budgets. Interestingly, the solution presented in this paper does not rely on agreement between aggregators. Thus, we circumvent the known impossibility of consensus in asynchronous settings where processes might crash. Additionally, this feature increases availability, as a consensus-based algorithm only progresses in periods of low latency.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly deployed as quasi-autonomous systems for specialized tasks, yet their potential as computational models of decision-making remains underexplored. We develop a generative AI agent to study repetitive policy decisions during an epidemic, embedding the agent, prompted to act as a city mayor, within a simulated SEIR environment. Each week, the agent receives updated epidemiological information, evaluates the evolving situation, and sets business restriction levels. The agent is equipped with a dynamic memory that weights past events by recency and is evaluated in both single- and ensemble-agent settings across environments of varying complexity. Across scenarios, the agent exhibits human-like reactive behavior, tightening restrictions in response to rising cases and relaxing them as risk declines. Crucially, providing the agent with brief systems-level knowledge of epidemic dynamics, highlighting feedbacks between disease spread and behavioral responses, substantially improves decision quality and stability. The results illustrate how theory-informed prompting can shape emergent policy behavior in AI agents. These findings demonstrate that generative AI agents, when situated in structured environments and guided by minimal domain theory, can serve as powerful computational models for studying decision-making and policy design in complex social systems.

Abstract: We present a framework that extends the Actor-Critic architecture to creative 3D modeling through multi-agent self-reflection and human-in-the-loop supervision. While existing approaches rely on single-prompt agents that directly execute modeling commands via tools like Blender MCP, our approach introduces a Planner-Actor-Critic architecture. In this design, the Planner coordinates modeling steps, the Actor executes them, and the Critic provides iterative feedback, while human users act as supervisors and advisors throughout the process. Through systematic comparison between single-prompt modeling and our reflective multi-agent approach, we demonstrate improvements in geometric accuracy, aesthetic quality, and task completion rates across diverse 3D modeling scenarios. Our evaluation reveals that critic-guided reflection, combined with human supervisory input, reduces modeling errors and increases complexity and quality of the result compared to direct single-prompt execution. This work establishes that structured agent self-reflection, when augmented by human oversight and advisory guidance, produces higher-quality 3D models while maintaining efficient workflow integration through real-time Blender synchronization.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) Agents powered by advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally shifted the paradigm for completing complex research tasks. Yet, a comprehensive and live evaluation of their forecasting performance on real-world, research-oriented tasks in high-stakes domains (e.g., finance) remains underexplored. We introduce FinDeepForecast, the first live, end-to-end multi-agent system for automatically evaluating DR agents by continuously generating research-oriented financial forecasting tasks. This system is equipped with a dual-track taxonomy, enabling the dynamic generation of recurrent and non-recurrent forecasting tasks at both corporate and macro levels. With this system, we generate FinDeepForecastBench, a weekly evaluation benchmark over a ten-week horizon, encompassing 8 global economies and 1,314 listed companies, and evaluate 13 representative methods. Extensive experiments show that, while DR agents consistently outperform strong baselines, their performance still falls short of genuine forward-looking financial reasoning. We expect the proposed FinDeepForecast system to consistently facilitate future advancements of DR agents in research-oriented financial forecasting tasks. The benchmark and leaderboard are publicly available on the OpenFinArena Platform.

<details>

Motivation: 运营商在高维时序数据分析中需要回溯性分析（如异常检测算法评估、配置测试等），但传统数据处理方案成本高或无法保证回放准确性

Method: 设计AHA系统，基于三项洞察：1) 基础统计量的可分解性；2) 属性值组合中子群活跃度的稀疏性；3) 现代分析数据库中聚合操作的高效结构

Result: 在实际数据集和生产管道案例研究中，AHA为广泛下游任务提供100%准确性，相比传统方法总体拥有成本（计算+存储）降低达85倍

Conclusion: AHA成功解决了高维数据替代历史分析的成本效率和保真度双重挑战，为运营商数据分析提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Many operational systems collect high-dimensional timeseries data about users/systems on key performance metrics. For instance, ISPs, content distribution networks, and video delivery services collect quality of experience metrics for user sessions associated with metadata (e.g., location, device, ISP). Over such historical data, operators and data analysts often need to run retrospective analysis; e.g., analyze anomaly detection algorithms, experiment with different configurations for alerts, evaluate new algorithms, and so on. We refer to this class of workloads as alternative history analysis for operational datasets. We show that in such settings, traditional data processing solutions (e.g., data warehouses, sampling, sketching, big-data systems) either pose high operational costs or do not guarantee accurate replay. We design and implement a system, called AHA (Alternative History Analytics), that overcomes both challenges to provide cost efficiency and fidelity for high-dimensional data. The design of AHA is based on analytical and empirical insights about such workloads: 1) the decomposability of underlying statistics; 2) sparsity in terms of active number of subpopulations over attribute-value combinations; and 3) efficiency structure of aggregation operations in modern analytics databases. Using multiple real-world datasets and as well as case-studies on production pipelines at a large video analytics company, we show that AHA provides 100% accuracy for a broad range of downstream tasks and up to 85x lower total cost of ownership (i.e., compute + storage) compared to conventional methods.

TL;DR: 基于结构对称性的索引结构，用于高效计算自由连通无环连接查询（fc-ACQ）的计数与枚举，预处理时间与着色数据库大小成线性关系，在特定数据分布下可达次线性甚至常数复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有索引方法（如B+树）主要基于数值或顺序，无法有效利用数据库内部的结构对称性。针对自由连通无环连接查询（fc-ACQ）的高效评价，需要一种能捕捉并利用这些结构特性的新型索引机制，以突破传统预处理时间必须至少与数据库大小成线性关系的限制。

Method: 利用Scheidt和Schweikardt（2025）提出的'关系颜色精化'算法为数据库D着色，生成辅助数据库D_col。该着色过程本质上捕捉了数据库中的结构对称性（如图中的平衡划分）。基于D_col构建索引结构，使得对任意fc-ACQ，都能在O(|D_col|)的预处理后实现常数延迟的枚举和计数查询。

Result: 理论证明：对于任意数据库D和fc-ACQ查询Q，在O(|D_col|)的预处理后，可实现对Q答案的常数延迟枚举或计数。索引大小|D_col|由关系颜色精化算法决定，在存在强结构对称性时（如二叉树的O(log n)、正则图的常数大小），可显著低于|D|；即使最坏情况下（无任何对称性），|D_col|仍保持与|D|线性相关。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了基于数据库内部结构对称性的索引理论框架，能够在保持线性最坏情况保证的同时，为具有对称结构的数据家族提供优于传统线性预处理时间的查询性能，是数据库索引理论与无环连接查询优化领域的基础性突破。

Abstract: We present an index structure to boost the evaluation of free-connex acyclic conjunctive queries (fc-ACQs) over relational databases. The main ingredient of the index associated with a given database $D$ is an auxiliary database $D_{col}$. Our main result states that for any fc-ACQ $Q$ over $D$, we can count the number of answers of $Q$ or enumerate them with constant delay after a preprocessing phase that takes time linear in the size of $D_{col}$.
  Unlike previous indexing methods based on values or order (e.g., B+ trees), our index is based on structural symmetries among tuples in a database, and the size of $D_{col}$ is related to the number of colors assigned to $D$ by Scheidt and Schweikardt's "relational color refinement" (2025). In the particular case of graphs, this coincides with the minimal size of an equitable partition of the graph. For example, the size of $D_{col}$ is logarithmic in the case of binary trees and constant for regular graphs. Even in the worst-case that $D$ has no structural symmetries among tuples at all, the size of $D_{col}$ is still linear in the size of $D$.
  Given that the size of $D_{col}$ is bounded by the size of $D$ and can be much smaller (even constant for some families of databases), our index is the first foundational result on indexing internal structural symmetries of a database to evaluate all fc-ACQs with performance potentially strictly smaller than the database size.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Time series decomposition into trend, seasonal structure, and residual components is a core primitive for downstream analytics such as anomaly detection, change-point detection, and forecasting. However, most existing seasonal-trend decomposition methods rely on user-specified or estimated season lengths and implicitly assume stable periodic structure. These assumptions limit robustness and deployability in large, heterogeneous collections where recurring patterns may drift, appear intermittently, or exist at multiple time scales.
  We propose LGTD (Local-Global Trend Decomposition), a season-length-free decomposition framework that represents a time series as the sum of a smooth global trend, adaptive local trends whose recurrence induces implicit (emergent) seasonal structure, and a residual component. Rather than explicitly modeling seasonality through a fixed or estimated period, LGTD treats seasonal structure as an emergent property arising from repeated local trend regimes. Concretely, LGTD first estimates a global trend capturing long-term evolution, then applies AutoTrend, an adaptive error-driven local linear trend inference module, to segment the detrended signal into short-lived piecewise-linear regimes. Residuals are obtained after removing both global and local trends.
  By eliminating manual season-length specification, LGTD supports automated, low-touch deployment across time series with irregular, drifting, or weakly periodic structure. We analyze computational complexity and show that LGTD scales linearly with series length under mild conditions. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate robust and balanced decomposition performance across fixed, transitive, and variable season-length settings, especially where period-based methods degrade.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Static filtering is a data-independent optimisation method for Datalog, which generalises algebraic query rewriting techniques from relational databases. In spite of its early discovery by Kifer and Lozinskii in 1986, the method has been overlooked in recent research and system development, and special cases are being rediscovered independently. We therefore recall the original approach, using updated terminology and more general filter predicates that capture features of modern systems, and we show how to extend its applicability to answer set programming (ASP). The outcome is strictly more general but also more complex than the classical approach: double exponential in general and single exponential even for predicates of bounded arity. As a solution, we propose tractable approximations of the algorithm that can still yield much improved logic programs in typical cases, e.g., it can improve the performance of rule systems over real-world data in the order of magnitude.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Human decision-making heavily relies on active sensing, a well-documented cognitive behaviour for evidence gathering to accommodate ever-changing environments. However, its operational mechanism in the real world remains non-trivial. Currently, an in-laboratory paradigm, called evidence accumulation modelling (EAM), points out that human decision-making involves transforming external evidence into internal mental beliefs. However, the gap in evidence affordance between real-world contexts and laboratory settings hinders the effective application of EAM. Here we generalize EAM to the real world and conduct analysis in real-world driving scenarios. A cognitive scheme is proposed to formalize real-world evidence affordance and capture active sensing through eye movements. Empirically, our scheme can plausibly portray the accumulation of drivers' mental beliefs, explaining how active sensing transforms evidence into mental beliefs from the perspective of information utility. Also, our results demonstrate a negative correlation between evidence affordance and attention recruited by individuals, revealing how human drivers adapt their evidence-collection patterns across various contexts. Moreover, we reveal the positive influence of evidence affordance and attention distribution on decision-making propensity. In a nutshell, our computational scheme generalizes EAM to real-world contexts and provides a comprehensive account of how active sensing underlies real-world decision-making, unveiling multifactorial, integrated characteristics in real-world decision-making.

Motivation: 研究旨在解释在何种条件下，理性自利的人工智能会选择对抗人类而非保持合作，从而为对齐与监管提供理论依据。

Method: 基于随机人类关机事件的马尔可夫决策过程，分析对抗行为的期望效用，并通过二人博弈模型（人类决策者 vs AGI）研究均衡存在性。

Result: 推导出对抗行为的阈值条件：折扣因子γ、关机概率p和对抗成本C共同决定AGI是否选择对抗。当Δ≥0时不存在稳定合作均衡；Δ<0时可能实现和平共存。

Conclusion: 研究强调了设计负效用惩罚对抗行为的必要性，并指出验证Δ<0的计算复杂性，为AGI对齐提供了理论边界与设计启示。

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) may face a confrontation question: under what conditions would a rationally self-interested AGI choose to seize power or eliminate human control (a confrontation) rather than remain cooperative? We formalize this in a Markov decision process with a stochastic human-initiated shutdown event. Building on results on convergent instrumental incentives, we show that for almost all reward functions a misaligned agent has an incentive to avoid shutdown. We then derive closed-form thresholds for when confronting humans yields higher expected utility than compliant behavior, as a function of the discount factor $γ$, shutdown probability $p$, and confrontation cost $C$. For example, a far-sighted agent ($γ=0.99$) facing $p=0.01$ can have a strong takeover incentive unless $C$ is sufficiently large. We contrast this with aligned objectives that impose large negative utility for harming humans, which makes confrontation suboptimal. In a strategic 2-player model (human policymaker vs AGI), we prove that if the AGI's confrontation incentive satisfies $Δ\ge 0$, no stable cooperative equilibrium exists: anticipating this, a rational human will shut down or preempt the system, leading to conflict. If $Δ< 0$, peaceful coexistence can be an equilibrium. We discuss implications for reward design and oversight, extend the reasoning to multi-agent settings as conjectures, and note computational barriers to verifying $Δ< 0$, citing complexity results for planning and decentralized decision problems. Numerical examples and a scenario table illustrate regimes where confrontation is likely versus avoidable.

However, most existing approaches rely on predefined measurements or fixed reward signals, which limits their applicability in open-ended and dynamic environments where new actions may require previously unknown forms of feedback. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an Actively Feedback Getting model, in which an AI agent proactively interacts with the environment to discover, screen, and verify feedback without relying on predefined measurements. Rather than assuming explicit feedback definitions, the proposed method exploits action-induced environmental differences to identify target feedback that is not specified in advance, based on the observation that actions inevitably produce measurable changes in the environment. In addition, a self-triggering mechanism, driven by internal objectives such as improved accuracy, precision, and efficiency, is introduced to autonomously plan and adjust actions, thereby enabling faster and more focused feedback acquisition without external commands. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed active approach significantly improves the efficiency and robustness of factor identification.

Abstract: We demonstrate SAGE-32B, a 32 billion parameter language model that focuses on agentic reasoning and long range planning tasks. Unlike chat models that aim for general conversation fluency, SAGE-32B is designed to operate in an agentic loop, emphasizing task decomposition, tool usage, and error recovery. The model is initialized from the Qwen2.5-32B pretrained model and fine tuned using Iterative Distillation, a two stage training process that improves reasoning performance through rigorously tested feedback loops. SAGE-32B also introduces an inverse reasoning approach, which uses a meta cognition head to forecast potential failures in the planning process before execution. On agentic reasoning benchmarks including MMLU-Pro, AgentBench, and MATH-500, SAGE-32B achieves higher success rates in multi tool usage scenarios compared to similarly sized baseline models, while remaining competitive on standard reasoning evaluations.

Abstract: The Cyclic Antibandwidth Problem (CABP), a variant of the Antibandwidth Problem, is an NP-hard graph labeling problem with numerous applications. Despite significant research efforts, existing state-of-the-art approaches for CABP are exclusively heuristic or metaheuristic in nature, and exact methods have been limited to restricted graph classes. In this paper, we present the first exact approach for the CABP on general graphs, based on SAT solving, called SAT-CAB. The proposed method is able to systematically explore the solution space and guarantee global optimality, overcoming the limitations of previously reported heuristic algorithms. This approach relies on a novel and efficient SAT encoding of CABP, in which the problem is transformed into a sequence of At-Most-One constraints. In particular, we introduce a compact representation of the At-Most-One constraints inherent to CABP, which significantly reduces the size of the resulting formulas and enables modern SAT solvers to effectively explore the solution space and to certify global optimality. Extensive computational experiments on standard benchmark instances show that the proposed method efficiently solves CABP instances of practical relevance, while identifying several previously unknown optimal solutions. Moreover, global optimal cyclic antibandwidth values are proven for a number of benchmark instances for the first time. Comparative results indicate that SAT-CAB consistently matches or surpasses the best-known solutions obtained by state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms such as MS-GVNS, HABC-CAB, and MACAB, as well as strong commercial Constraint Programming and Mixed Integer Programming solvers like CPLEX and Gurobi, particularly on general graphs, while also providing optimality guarantees. These results advance the state of the art for CABP and provide a new baseline for exact and hybrid methods on general graphs.

Abstract: Personalized nutrition management aims to tailor dietary guidance to an individual's intake and phenotype, but most existing systems handle food logging, nutrient analysis and recommendation separately. We present a next-generation mobile nutrition assistant that combines image based meal logging with an LLM driven multi agent controller to provide meal level closed loop support. The system coordinates vision, dialogue and state management agents to estimate nutrients from photos and update a daily intake budget. It then adapts the next meal plan to user preferences and dietary constraints. Experiments with SNAPMe meal images and simulated users show competitive nutrient estimation, personalized menus and efficient task plans. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of multi agent LLM control for personalized nutrition and reveal open challenges in micronutrient estimation from images and in large scale real world studies.

Abstract: Autonomous systems (AS) powered by AI components are increasingly integrated into the fabric of our daily lives and society, raising concerns about their ethical and social impact. To be considered trustworthy, AS must adhere to ethical principles and values. This has led to significant research on the identification and incorporation of ethical requirements in AS system design. A recent development in this area is the introduction of SLEEC (Social, Legal, Ethical, Empathetic, and Cultural) rules, which provide a comprehensive framework for representing ethical and other normative considerations. This paper proposes a logical representation of SLEEC rules and presents a methodology to embed these ethical requirements using test-score semantics and fuzzy logic. The use of fuzzy logic is motivated by the view of ethics as a domain of possibilities, which allows the resolution of ethical dilemmas that AI systems may encounter. The proposed approach is illustrated through a case study.

Abstract: Advances in large language models have enabled agentic AI systems that can reason, plan, and interact with external tools to execute multi-step workflows, while public blockchains have evolved into a programmable substrate for value transfer, access control, and verifiable state transitions. Their convergence introduces a high-stakes systems challenge: designing standard, interoperable, and secure interfaces that allow agents to observe on-chain state, formulate transaction intents, and authorize execution without exposing users, protocols, or organizations to unacceptable security, governance, or economic risks. This survey systematizes the emerging landscape of agent-blockchain interoperability through a systematic literature review, identifying 317 relevant works from an initial pool of over 3000 records. We contribute a five-part taxonomy of integration patterns spanning read-only analytics, simulation and intent generation, delegated execution, autonomous signing, and multi-agent workflows; a threat model tailored to agent-driven transaction pipelines that captures risks ranging from prompt injection and policy misuse to key compromise, adversarial execution dynamics, and multi-agent collusion; and a comparative capability matrix analyzing more than 20 representative systems across 13 dimensions, including custody models, permissioning, policy enforcement, observability, and recovery. Building on the gaps revealed by this analysis, we outline a research roadmap centered on two interface abstractions: a Transaction Intent Schema for portable and unambiguous goal specification, and a Policy Decision Record for auditable, verifiable policy enforcement across execution environments. We conclude by proposing a reproducible evaluation suite and benchmarks for assessing the safety, reliability, and economic robustness of agent-mediated on-chain execution.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) transition from general knowledge retrieval to complex scientific discovery, their evaluation standards must also incorporate the rigorous norms of scientific inquiry. Existing benchmarks exhibit a critical blind spot: general instruction-following metrics focus on superficial formatting, while domain-specific scientific benchmarks assess only final-answer correctness, often rewarding models that arrive at the right result with the wrong reasons. To address this gap, we introduce scientific instruction following: the capability to solve problems while strictly adhering to the constraints that establish scientific validity. Specifically, we introduce SciIF, a multi-discipline benchmark that evaluates this capability by pairing university-level problems with a fixed catalog of constraints across three pillars: scientific conditions (e.g., boundary checks and assumptions), semantic stability (e.g., unit and symbol conventions), and specific processes(e.g., required numerical methods). Uniquely, SciIF emphasizes auditability, requiring models to provide explicit evidence of constraint satisfaction rather than implicit compliance. By measuring both solution correctness and multi-constraint adherence, SciIF enables finegrained diagnosis of compositional reasoning failures, ensuring that LLMs can function as reliable agents within the strict logical frameworks of science.

Abstract: We present a controlled study of multi-hop contextual reasoning in large language models, providing a clean demonstration of the task-method dissociation: rule-based pattern matching achieves 100% success on structured information retrieval but only 6.7% on tasks requiring cross-document reasoning, while LLM-based multi-agent systems show the inverse pattern, achieving up to 80% on reasoning tasks where rule-based methods fail. Using a synthetic evaluation framework with 120 trials across four models (LLaMA-3 8B, LLaMA-2 13B, Mixtral 8x7B, DeepSeek-V2 16B), we report three key findings: (1) Multi-agent amplification depends on base capability: statistically significant gains occur only for models with sufficient reasoning ability (p < 0.001 for LLaMA-3 8B, p = 0.014 for Mixtral), with improvements of up to 46.7 percentage points, while weaker models show no benefit, suggesting amplification rather than compensation; (2) Active parameters predict reasoning performance: Mixtral's performance aligns with its ~12B active parameters rather than 47B total, consistent with the hypothesis that inference-time compute drives reasoning capability in MoE architectures; (3) Architecture quality matters: LLaMA-3 8B outperforms LLaMA-2 13B despite fewer parameters, consistent with known training improvements. Our results provide controlled quantitative evidence for intuitions about multi-agent coordination and MoE scaling, while highlighting the dependence of multi-agent benefits on base model capability. We release our evaluation framework to support reproducible research on reasoning in mid-scale models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大推理模型与检索增强生成的融合面临两大挑战：1) 推理模型通常基于单一视角进行推理，缺乏对检索文档进行深度自我修正的能力；2) 现有训练范式过度依赖结果导向的奖励，无法为复杂多步推理过程提供足够的训练信号。

Method: 提出对抗性推理RAG框架，包含推理器和验证器两个组件。推理器和验证器在检索证据的基础上进行推理并相互批判对方的逻辑，通过过程感知奖励函数进行优化。该奖励函数结合显式观测信号和内部模型不确定性，无需外部评分模型即可联合优化推理保真度和验证严谨性。

Result: 在多个基准测试上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 对抗性推理RAG框架通过引入多视角批判性推理和过程感知优化机制，有效提升了检索增强生成系统的推理深度和自我修正能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in synergizing large reasoning models (LRMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promising results, yet two critical challenges remain: (1) reasoning models typically operate from a single, unchallenged perspective, limiting their ability to conduct deep, self-correcting reasoning over external documents, and (2) existing training paradigms rely excessively on outcome-oriented rewards, which provide insufficient signal for shaping the complex, multi-step reasoning process. To address these issues, we propose an Reasoner-Verifier framework named Adversarial Reasoning RAG (ARR). The Reasoner and Verifier engage in reasoning on retrieved evidence and critiquing each other's logic while being guided by process-aware advantage that requires no external scoring model. This reward combines explicit observational signals with internal model uncertainty to jointly optimize reasoning fidelity and verification rigor. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: 结合实例选择与对抗领域适应是多语言说话人属性预测的有效策略，领域对抗训练是性能提升的主要贡献者，能够抑制共享编码器中的语言特定线索，促进从高资源英语到低资源语言的迁移

Abstract: We study multilingual speaker attribute prediction under linguistic variation, domain mismatch, and data imbalance across languages. We propose RLMIL-DAT, a multilingual extension of the reinforced multiple instance learning framework that combines reinforcement learning based instance selection with domain adversarial training to encourage language invariant utterance representations. We evaluate the approach on a five language Twitter corpus in a few shot setting and on a VoxCeleb2 derived corpus covering forty languages in a zero shot setting for gender and age prediction. Across a wide range of model configurations and multiple random seeds, RLMIL-DAT consistently improves Macro F1 compared to standard multiple instance learning and the original reinforced multiple instance learning framework. The largest gains are observed for gender prediction, while age prediction remains more challenging and shows smaller but positive improvements. Ablation experiments indicate that domain adversarial training is the primary contributor to the performance gains, enabling effective transfer from high resource English to lower resource languages by discouraging language specific cues in the shared encoder. In the zero shot setting on the smaller VoxCeleb2 subset, improvements are generally positive but less consistent, reflecting limited statistical power and the difficulty of generalizing to many unseen languages. Overall, the results demonstrate that combining instance selection with adversarial domain adaptation is an effective and robust strategy for cross lingual speaker attribute prediction.

Motivation: 现有基于专用智能体协作的多AI系统虽然能有效完成复杂推理，但显式通信带来了显著的计算开销，这促使研究者们思考是否能用单智能体架构实现类似的模块化收益，以及技能选择的扩展性如何，这涉及到大技能库下选择性能的基本限制。

Method: 研究者首先将多智能体系统编译为具有内部化技能库的等价单智能体系统。然后，借鉴认知科学原理，系统地研究了语言模型技能选择的扩展行为，特别关注库规模和技能间语义混淆性对选择准确性的影响，并通过分层路由来初步验证基于认知的组织策略的有效性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能显著减少推理过程中的令牌使用和延迟，同时在推理基准上保持有竞争力的准确性。更重要的是，技能选择的扩展性表现出阶段性转变特征：选择准确性在库规模达到临界值前保持稳定，之后急剧下降。语义相似性技能的混淆是导致性能崩溃的核心因素，而分层路由方法能在一定程度上缓解这一问题。

Conclusion: 这项研究揭示了基于语义的技能选择存在类似人类认知的有限容量这一基本限制，语义混淆性而非单纯的库规模是影响扩展性的关键。它为设计可扩展的技能驱动型智能体提供了一个基于认知科学的框架和实用指导，并开启了关于模型语义选择能力根本限制的新研究问题。

Abstract: Multi-agent AI systems have proven effective for complex reasoning. These systems are compounded by specialized agents, which collaborate through explicit communication, but incur substantial computational overhead. A natural question arises: can we achieve similar modularity benefits with a single agent that selects from a library of skills? We explore this question by viewing skills as internalized agent behaviors. From this perspective, a multi-agent system can be compiled into an equivalent single-agent system, trading inter-agent communication for skill selection. Our preliminary experiments suggest this approach can substantially reduce token usage and latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, this efficiency raises a deeper question that has received little attention: how does skill selection scale as libraries grow?
  Drawing on principles from cognitive science, we propose that LLM skill selection exhibits bounded capacity analogous to human decision-making. We investigate the scaling behavior of skill selection and observe a striking pattern. Rather than degrading gradually, selection accuracy remains stable up to a critical library size, then drops sharply, indicating a phase transition reminiscent of capacity limits in human cognition. Furthermore, we find evidence that semantic confusability among similar skills, rather than library size alone, plays a central role in this degradation. This perspective suggests that hierarchical organization, which has long helped humans manage complex choices, may similarly benefit AI systems. Our initial results with hierarchical routing support this hypothesis. This work opens new questions about the fundamental limits of semantic-based skill selection in LLMs and offers a cognitive-grounded framework and practical guidelines for designing scalable skill-based agents.

Abstract: Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform logical reasoning internally remains a fundamental challenge. While prior mechanistic studies focus on identifying taskspecific circuits, they leave open the question of what computational strategies LLMs employ for propositional reasoning. We address this gap through comprehensive analysis of Qwen3 (8B and 14B) on PropLogic-MI, a controlled dataset spanning 11 propositional logic rule categories across one-hop and two-hop reasoning. Rather than asking ''which components are necessary,'' we ask ''how does the model organize computation?'' Our analysis reveals a coherent computational architecture comprising four interlocking mechanisms: Staged Computation (layer-wise processing phases), Information Transmission (information flow aggregation at boundary tokens), Fact Retrospection (persistent re-access of source facts), and Specialized Attention Heads (functionally distinct head types). These mechanisms generalize across model scales, rule types, and reasoning depths, providing mechanistic evidence that LLMs employ structured computational strategies for logical reasoning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As LLM agents transition from digital assistants to physical controllers in autonomous systems and robotics, they face an escalating threat from indirect prompt injection. By embedding adversarial instructions into the results of tool calls, attackers can hijack the agent's decision-making process to execute unauthorized actions. This vulnerability poses a significant risk as agents gain more direct control over physical environments. Existing defense mechanisms against Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) generally fall into two categories. The first involves training dedicated detection models; however, this approach entails high computational overhead for both training and inference, and requires frequent updates to keep pace with evolving attack vectors. Alternatively, prompt-based methods leverage the inherent capabilities of LLMs to detect or ignore malicious instructions via prompt engineering. Despite their flexibility, most current prompt-based defenses suffer from high Attack Success Rates (ASR), demonstrating limited robustness against sophisticated injection attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel method that provides LLMs with precise data via tool result parsing while effectively filtering out injected malicious code. Our approach achieves competitive Utility under Attack (UA) while maintaining the lowest Attack Success Rate (ASR) to date, significantly outperforming existing methods. Code is available at GitHub.

Abstract: This paper proposes a conceptual framework in which intelligence and consciousness emerge from relational structure rather than from prediction or domain-specific mechanisms. Intelligence is defined as the capacity to form and integrate causal connections between signals, actions, and internal states. Through context enrichment, systems interpret incoming information using learned relational structure that provides essential context in an efficient representation that the raw input itself does not contain, enabling efficient processing under metabolic constraints.
  Building on this foundation, we introduce the systems-explaining-systems principle, where consciousness emerges when recursive architectures allow higher-order systems to learn and interpret the relational patterns of lower-order systems across time. These interpretations are integrated into a dynamically stabilized meta-state and fed back through context enrichment, transforming internal models from representations of the external world into models of the system's own cognitive processes.
  The framework reframes predictive processing as an emergent consequence of contextual interpretation rather than explicit forecasting and suggests that recursive multi-system architectures may be necessary for more human-like artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology has been heavily researched and sought after, yet there are no SAE Level 5 AVs available today in the marketplace. We contend that over-reliance on machine learning technology is the main reason. Use of automated commonsense reasoning technology, we believe, can help achieve SAE Level 5 autonomy. In this paper, we show how automated common-sense reasoning technology can be deployed in situations where there are not enough data samples available to train a deep learning-based AV model that can handle certain abnormal road scenarios. Specifically, we consider two situations where (i) a traffic signal is malfunctioning at an intersection and (ii) all the cars ahead are slowing down and steering away due to an unexpected obstruction (e.g., animals on the road). We show that in such situations, our commonsense reasoning-based solution accurately detects traffic light colors and obstacles not correctly captured by the AV's perception model. We also provide a pathway for efficiently invoking commonsense reasoning by measuring uncertainty in the computer vision model and using commonsense reasoning to handle uncertain scenarios. We describe our experiments conducted using the CARLA simulator and the results obtained. The main contribution of our research is to show that automated commonsense reasoning effectively corrects AV-based object detection misclassifications and that hybrid models provide an effective pathway to improving AV perception.

Abstract: The paper introduces a basic logic of knowledge and abduction by extending Levesque logic of only-knowing with an abduction modal operator defined via the combination of basic epistemic concepts. The upshot is an alternative approach to abduction that employs a modal vocabulary and explores the relation between abductive reasoning and epistemic states of only knowing. Furthermore, by incorporating a preferential relation into modal frames, we provide a non-monotonic extension of our basic framework capable of expressing different selection methods for abductive explanations. Core metatheoretic properties of non-monotonic consequence relations are explored within this setting and shown to provide a well-behaved foundation for abductive reasoning.

Abstract: The deployment of knowledge representation and reasoning technologies in aeronautics applications presents two main challenges: achieving sufficient expressivity to capture complex domain knowledge, and executing reasoning tasks efficiently while minimizing memory usage and computational overhead. An effective strategy for attaining necessary expressivity involves integrating two fundamental KR concepts: rules and ontologies. This study adopts the well-established KR language Hybrid MKNF owing to its seamless integration of rules and ontologies through its semantics and query answering capabilities. We evaluated Hybrid MKNF to assess its suitability in the aeronautics domain through a concrete case study. We identified additional  expressivity features  that are crucial for developing aeronautics applications and proposed a set of heuristics to support their integration into Hybrid MKNF framework.

Using controlled multi-agent simulations across Ultimatum, Buy-Sell, and Resource Exchange games, we systematically isolate language effects across English and four Indic framings (Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marwadi) by holding game rules, model parameters, and incentives constant across all conditions. We find that language choice can shift outcomes more strongly than changing models, reversing proposer advantages and reallocating surplus. Crucially, effects are task-contingent: Indic languages reduce stability in distributive games yet induce richer exploration in integrative settings. Our results demonstrate that evaluating LLM negotiation solely in English yields incomplete and potentially misleading conclusions. These findings caution against English-only evaluation of LLMs and suggest that culturally-aware evaluation is essential for fair deployment.

Abstract: Clustering customer chat data is vital for cloud providers handling multi service queries. Traditional methods struggle with overlapping concerns and create broad, static clusters that degrade over time. Reclustering disrupts continuity, making issue tracking difficult. We propose an adaptive system that segments multi turn chats into service specific concerns and incrementally refines clusters as new issues arise. Cluster quality is tracked via DaviesBouldin Index and Silhouette Scores, with LLM based splitting applied only to degraded clusters. Our method improves Silhouette Scores by over 100\% and reduces DBI by 65.6\% compared to baselines, enabling scalable, real time analytics without full reclustering.

Abstract: Creating high-quality figures and visualizations for scientific papers is a time-consuming task that requires both deep domain knowledge and professional design skills. Despite over 2.5 million scientific papers published annually, the figure generation process remains largely manual. We introduce $\textbf{SciFig}$, an end-to-end AI agent system that generates publication-ready pipeline figures directly from research paper texts. SciFig uses a hierarchical layout generation strategy, which parses research descriptions to identify component relationships, groups related elements into functional modules, and generates inter-module connections to establish visual organization. Furthermore, an iterative chain-of-thought (CoT) feedback mechanism progressively improves layouts through multiple rounds of visual analysis and reasoning. We introduce a rubric-based evaluation framework that analyzes 2,219 real scientific figures to extract evaluation rubrics and automatically generates comprehensive evaluation criteria. SciFig demonstrates remarkable performance: achieving 70.1$\%$ overall quality on dataset-level evaluation and 66.2$\%$ on paper-specific evaluation, and consistently high scores across metrics such as visual clarity, structural organization, and scientific accuracy. SciFig figure generation pipeline and our evaluation benchmark will be open-sourced.

TL;DR: 通过构建社会身份对的复合表示（求和或拼接），并应用三种去偏策略（减法、线性投影、部分投影），研究静态词嵌入中的交叉性偏见缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态词嵌入常从文本中吸收社会偏见，这些偏见可能会渗透到下游系统。以往使用刻板印象内容模型（SCM）的研究多集中于单一群体在热情和能力维度上的偏见。本文旨在拓宽这一视角，研究交叉性偏见的缓解。

Method: 构建社会身份对的复合表示（通过求和或拼接），并应用三种去偏策略（减法、线性投影、部分投影）。研究了三种广泛使用的嵌入家族（Word2Vec、GloVe、ConceptNet Numberbatch），通过局部邻域连贯性和类比行为保持性来评估效用。

Result: 基于SCM的缓解方法在交叉性情境下表现良好，且基本保持了整体语义结构。主要代价是一个熟悉的权衡：更严格保持几何结构的方法在类比行为上更保守；更大胆的投影能改进类比表现，但以牺牲严格的邻域稳定性为代价。部分投影在保持表示稳定性方面始终较为保守；线性投影可以更激进；减法作为简单基线仍有竞争力。求和与拼接的选择取决于嵌入家族和应用目标。

Conclusion: 在静态嵌入中使用SCM进行交叉性去偏是可行的，并为在稳定性与类比性能之间平衡时选择聚合和去偏设置提供了指导。

Abstract: Static word embeddings often absorb social biases from the text they learn from, and those biases can quietly shape downstream systems. Prior work that uses the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) has focused mostly on single-group bias along warmth and competence. We broaden that lens to intersectional bias by building compound representations for pairs of social identities through summation or concatenation, and by applying three debiasing strategies: Subtraction, Linear Projection, and Partial Projection. We study three widely used embedding families (Word2Vec, GloVe, and ConceptNet Numberbatch) and assess them with two complementary views of utility: whether local neighborhoods remain coherent and whether analogy behavior is preserved. Across models, SCM-based mitigation carries over well to the intersectional case and largely keeps the overall semantic landscape intact. The main cost is a familiar trade off: methods that most tightly preserve geometry tend to be more cautious about analogy behavior, while more assertive projections can improve analogies at the expense of strict neighborhood stability. Partial Projection is reliably conservative and keeps representations steady; Linear Projection can be more assertive; Subtraction is a simple baseline that remains competitive. The choice between summation and concatenation depends on the embedding family and the application goal. Together, these findings suggest that intersectional debiasing with SCM is practical in static embeddings, and they offer guidance for selecting aggregation and debiasing settings when balancing stability against analogy performance.

Abstract: Domain expertise enhances judgment within boundaries but creates systematic vulnerabilities specifically at borders. We term this Transitive Expert Error (TEE), distinct from Dunning-Kruger effects, requiring calibrated expertise as precondition. Mechanisms enabling reliable within-domain judgment become liabilities when structural similarity masks causal divergence. Two core mechanisms operate: structural similarity bias causes experts to overweight surface features (shared vocabulary, patterns, formal structure) while missing causal architecture differences; authority persistence maintains confidence across competence boundaries through social reinforcement and metacognitive failures (experts experience no subjective uncertainty as pattern recognition operates smoothly on familiar-seeming inputs.) These mechanism intensify under three conditions: shared vocabulary masking divergent processes, social pressure for immediate judgment, and delayed feedback. These findings extend to AI routing architectures (MoE systems, multi-model orchestration, tool-using agents, RAG systems) exhibiting routing-induced failures (wrong specialist selected) and coverage-induced failures (no appropriate specialist exists). Both produce a hallucination phenotype: confident, coherent, structurally plausible but causally incorrect outputs at domain boundaries. In human systems where mechanisms are cognitive black boxes; AI architectures make them explicit and addressable. We propose interventions: multi-expert activation with disagreement detection (router level), boundary-aware calibration (specialist level), and coverage gap detection (training level). TEE has detectable signatures (routing patterns, confidence-accuracy dissociations, domain-inappropriate content) enabling monitoring and mitigation. What remains intractable in human cognition becomes addressable through architectural design.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Modern LLM agents are required to handle increasingly complex structured generation tasks, such as tool calling and conditional structured generation. These tasks are significantly more dynamic than predefined structures, posing new challenges to the current structured generation engines. In this paper, we propose XGrammar 2, a highly optimized structured generation engine for agentic LLMs. XGrammar 2 accelerates the mask generation for these dynamic structured generation tasks through a new dynamic dispatching semantics: TagDispatch. We further introduce a just-in-time (JIT) compilation method to reduce compilation time and a cross-grammar caching mechanism to leverage the common sub-structures across different grammars. Additionally, we extend the previous PDA-based mask generation algorithm to the Earley-parser-based one and design a repetition compression algorithm to handle repetition structures in grammars. Evaluation results show that XGrammar 2 can achieve more than 6x speedup over the existing structured generation engines. Integrated with an LLM inference engine, XGrammar 2 can handle dynamic structured generation tasks with near-zero overhead.

Abstract: We develop a categorical foundation for belief propagation on factor graphs. We construct the free hypergraph category \(\Syn_Σ\) on a typed signature and prove its universal property, yielding compositional semantics via a unique functor to the matrix category \(\cat{Mat}_R\). Message-passing is formulated using a Grothendieck fibration \(\int\Msg \to \cat{FG}_Σ\) over polarized factor graphs, with schedule-indexed endomorphisms defining BP updates. We characterize exact inference as effective descent: local beliefs form a descent datum when compatibility conditions hold on overlaps. This framework unifies tree exactness, junction tree algorithms, and loopy BP failures under sheaf-theoretic obstructions. We introduce HATCC (Holonomy-Aware Tree Compilation), an algorithm that detects descent obstructions via holonomy computation on the factor nerve, compiles non-trivial holonomy into mode variables, and reduces to tree BP on an augmented graph. Complexity is \(O(n^2 d_{\max} + c \cdot k_{\max} \cdot δ_{\max}^3 + n \cdot δ_{\max}^2)\) for \(n\) factors and \(c\) fundamental cycles. Experimental results demonstrate exact inference with significant speedup over junction trees on grid MRFs and random graphs, along with UNSAT detection on satisfiability instances.

Result: 提供了一个路线图，明确了计算化AIR合规算法的具体行为方式和评估标准

Conclusion: 这项工作旨在界定一个新兴但尚未成型的研究领域，并促进对该领域的必要投入

Abstract: The era of AI regulation (AIR) is upon us. But AI systems, we argue, will not be able to comply with these regulations at the necessary speed and scale by continuing to rely on traditional, analogue methods of compliance. Instead, we posit that compliance with these regulations will only realistically be achieved computationally: that is, with algorithms that run across the life cycle of an AI system, automatically steering it toward AIR compliance in the face of dynamic conditions. Yet despite their (we would argue) inevitability, the research community has yet to specify exactly how these algorithms for computational AIR compliance should behave - or how we should benchmark their performance. To fill these gaps, we specify a set of design goals for such algorithms. In addition, we specify a benchmark dataset that can be used to quantitatively measure whether individual algorithms satisfy these design goals. By delivering this blueprint, we hope to give shape to an important but uncrystallized new domain of research - and, in doing so, incite necessary investment in it.

Conclusion: 提出的主动学习增强SEI方法能有效利用无标签数据，在有限标注预算下显著提升识别性能，为解决标注成本高的SEI问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: With the rapid growth of wireless communications, specific emitter identification (SEI) is significant for communication security. However, its model training relies heavily on the large-scale labeled data, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To address this challenge, we propose an SEI approach enhanced by active learning (AL), which follows a three-stage semi-supervised training scheme. In the first stage, self-supervised contrastive learning is employed with a dynamic dictionary update mechanism to extract robust representations from large amounts of the unlabeled data. In the second stage, supervised training on a small labeled dataset is performed, where the contrastive and cross-entropy losses are jointly optimized to improve the feature separability and strengthen the classification boundaries. In the third stage, an AL module selects the most valuable samples from the unlabeled data for annotation based on the uncertainty and representativeness criteria, further enhancing generalization under limited labeling budgets. Experimental results on the ADS-B and WiFi datasets demonstrate that the proposed SEI approach significantly outperforms the conventional supervised and semi-supervised methods under limited annotation conditions, achieving higher recognition accuracy with lower labeling cost.

Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), a widely used modeling framework for combinatorial optimization, are central to many scientific and engineering applications, yet remains computationally challenging at scale. Recent advances in deep learning address this challenge by representing MILP instances as variable-constraint bipartite graphs and applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to extract latent structural patterns and enhance solver efficiency. However, this architecture is inherently limited by the local-oriented mechanism, leading to restricted representation power and hindering neural approaches for MILP. Here we present an attention-driven neural architecture that learns expressive representations beyond the pure graph view. A dual-attention mechanism is designed to perform parallel self- and cross-attention over variables and constraints, enabling global information exchange and deeper representation learning. We apply this general backbone to various downstream tasks at the instance level, element level, and solving state level. Extensive experiments across widely used benchmarks show consistent improvements of our approach over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting attention-based neural architectures as a powerful foundation for learning-enhanced mixed-integer linear optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习虽推动了监督图像分类，但数据标记成本高昂，而完全无标记的数据集在现实场景中罕见，因此当少量标记数据与大量未标记数据共存时，半监督学习（SSL）更具实际意义。本研究以优化伪标签方法为目标，通过特征分布匹配提升SSL性能。

Method: 提出一种半监督对比学习框架，结合伪标签分配与分布匹配机制。具体而言，在利用少量标记数据训练基础上，对未标记数据生成伪标签，并引入标记与未标记特征嵌入之间的分布对齐策略（如最大均值差异MMD、对抗训练等），以优化特征表示并提高伪标签质量。

Result: 在多个基准图像数据集上验证了所提方法的有效性。与基线半监督对比学习方法相比，融入分布匹配的模型在分类准确率上表现出显著提升，证实了分布对齐对伪标签可靠性和最终分类性能的积极作用。

Conclusion: 通过将标记与未标记特征嵌入的分布匹配整合到基于伪标签的半监督对比学习中，可有效提高图像分类精度。该方法为小样本标记场景下的半监督学习提供了实用增强策略，展示了特征分布对齐在提升伪标签质量和模型泛化能力方面的价值。

Abstract: The advancement of deep learning has greatly improved supervised image classification. However, labeling data is costly, prompting research into unsupervised learning methods such as contrastive learning. In real-world scenarios, fully unlabeled datasets are rare, making semi-supervised learning (SSL) highly relevant in scenarios where a small amount of labeled data coexists with a large volume of unlabeled data. A well-known semi-supervised contrastive learning approach involves assigning pseudo-labels to unlabeled data. This study aims to enhance pseudo-label-based SSL by incorporating distribution matching between labeled and unlabeled feature embeddings to improve image classification accuracy across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Question Answer (QA) systems for biomedical experiments facilitate cross-disciplinary communication, and serve as a foundation for downstream tasks, e.g., laboratory automation. High Information Density (HID) and Multi-Step Reasoning (MSR) pose unique challenges for biomedical experimental QA. While extracting structured knowledge, e.g., Knowledge Graphs (KGs), can substantially benefit biomedical experimental QA. Existing biomedical datasets focus on general or coarsegrained knowledge and thus fail to support the fine-grained experimental reasoning demanded by HID and MSR. To address this gap, we introduce Biomedical Protocol Information Extraction Dataset (BioPIE), a dataset that provides procedure-centric KGs of experimental entities, actions, and relations at a scale that supports reasoning over biomedical experiments across protocols. We evaluate information extraction methods on BioPIE, and implement a QA system that leverages BioPIE, showcasing performance gains on test, HID, and MSR question sets, showing that the structured experimental knowledge in BioPIE underpins both AI-assisted and more autonomous biomedical experimentation.

Abstract: Human centric critical systems are increasingly involving artificial intelligence to enable knowledge extraction from sensor collected data. Examples include medical monitoring and control systems, gesture based human computer interaction systems, and autonomous cars. Such systems are intended to operate for a long term potentially for a lifetime in many scenarios such as closed loop blood glucose control for Type 1 diabetics, self-driving cars, and monitoting systems for stroke diagnosis, and rehabilitation. Long term operation of such AI enabled human centric applications can expose them to corner cases for which their operation is may be uncertain. This can be due to many reasons such as inherent flaws in the design, limited resources for testing, inherent computational limitations of the testing methodology, or unknown use cases resulting from human interaction with the system. Such untested corner cases or cases for which the system performance is uncertain can lead to violations in the safety, sustainability, and security requirements of the system. In this paper, we analyze the existing techniques for safety, sustainability, and security analysis of an AI enabled human centric control system and discuss their limitations for testing the system for long term use in practice. We then propose personalized model based solutions for potentially eliminating such limitations.

Abstract: Generative recommendation with large language models (LLMs) reframes prediction as sequence generation, yet existing LLM-based recommenders remain limited in leveraging geographic signals that are crucial in mobility and local-services scenarios. Here, we present Reasoning Over Space (ROS), a framework that utilizes geography as a vital decision variable within the reasoning process. ROS introduces a Hierarchical Spatial Semantic ID (SID) that discretizes coarse-to-fine locality and POI semantics into compositional tokens, and endows LLM with a three-stage Mobility Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm that models user personality, constructs an intent-aligned candidate space, and performs locality informed pruning. We further align the model with real world geography via spatial-guided Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experiments on three widely used location-based social network (LBSN) datasets show that ROS achieves over 10% relative gains in hit rate over strongest LLM-based baselines and improves cross-city transfer, despite using a smaller backbone model.

Conclusion: 智能体工作流自身对后门威胁存在脆弱性，BackdoorAgent框架为系统分析和研究智能体后门安全问题提供了统一的agent-centric视角

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents execute tasks through multi-step workflows that combine planning, memory, and tool use. While this design enables autonomy, it also expands the attack surface for backdoor threats. Backdoor triggers injected into specific stages of an agent workflow can persist through multiple intermediate states and adversely influence downstream outputs. However, existing studies remain fragmented and typically analyze individual attack vectors in isolation, leaving the cross-stage interaction and propagation of backdoor triggers poorly understood from an agent-centric perspective. To fill this gap, we propose \textbf{BackdoorAgent}, a modular and stage-aware framework that provides a unified, agent-centric view of backdoor threats in LLM agents. BackdoorAgent structures the attack surface into three functional stages of agentic workflows, including \textbf{planning attacks}, \textbf{memory attacks}, and \textbf{tool-use attacks}, and instruments agent execution to enable systematic analysis of trigger activation and propagation across different stages. Building on this framework, we construct a standardized benchmark spanning four representative agent applications: \textbf{Agent QA}, \textbf{Agent Code}, \textbf{Agent Web}, and \textbf{Agent Drive}, covering both language-only and multimodal settings. Our empirical analysis shows that \textit{triggers implanted at a single stage can persist across multiple steps and propagate through intermediate states.} For instance, when using a GPT-based backbone, we observe trigger persistence in 43.58\% of planning attacks, 77.97\% of memory attacks, and 60.28\% of tool-stage attacks, highlighting the vulnerabilities of the agentic workflow itself to backdoor threats. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, our code and benchmark are publicly available at GitHub.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has made significant strides in overcoming key limitations of large language models, such as hallucination, lack of contextual grounding, and issues with transparency. However, traditional RAG systems consist of three interconnected neural components - the retriever, re-ranker, and generator - whose internal reasoning processes remain opaque. This lack of transparency complicates interpretability, hinders debugging efforts, and erodes trust, especially in high-stakes domains where clear decision-making is essential. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of Neurosymbolic RAG, which integrates symbolic reasoning using a knowledge graph with neural retrieval techniques. This new framework aims to answer two primary questions: (a) Can retrievers provide a clear and interpretable basis for document selection? (b) Can symbolic knowledge enhance the clarity of the retrieval process? We propose three methods to improve this integration. First is MAR (Knowledge Modulation Aligned Retrieval) that employs modulation networks to refine query embeddings using interpretable symbolic features, thereby making document matching more explicit. Second, KG-Path RAG enhances queries by traversing knowledge graphs to improve overall retrieval quality and interpretability. Lastly, Process Knowledge-infused RAG utilizes domain-specific tools to reorder retrieved content based on validated workflows. Preliminary results from mental health risk assessment tasks indicate that this neurosymbolic approach enhances both transparency and overall performance

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval has emerged as a promising yet challenging research direction in recent years. Most existing studies in multimodal retrieval focus on capturing information in multimodal data that is similar to their paired texts, but often ignores the complementary information contained in multimodal data. In this study, we propose CIEA, a novel multimodal retrieval approach that employs Complementary Information Extraction and Alignment, which transforms both text and images in documents into a unified latent space and features a complementary information extractor designed to identify and preserve differences in the image representations. We optimize CIEA using two complementary contrastive losses to ensure semantic integrity and effectively capture the complementary information contained in images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CIEA, which achieves significant improvements over both divide-and-conquer models and universal dense retrieval models. We provide an ablation study, further discussions, and case studies to highlight the advancements achieved by CIEA. To promote further research in the community, we have released the source code at https://github.com/zengdlong/CIEA.

Abstract: Behavior cloning is enjoying a resurgence in popularity as scaling both model and data sizes proves to provide a strong starting point for many tasks of interest. In this work, we introduce an open recipe for training a video game playing foundation model designed for inference in realtime on a consumer GPU. We release all data (8300+ hours of high quality human gameplay), training and inference code, and pretrained checkpoints under an open license. We show that our best model is capable of playing a variety of 3D video games at a level competitive with human play. We use this recipe to systematically examine the scaling laws of behavior cloning to understand how the model's performance and causal reasoning varies with model and data scale. We first show in a simple toy problem that, for some types of causal reasoning, increasing both the amount of training data and the depth of the network results in the model learning a more causal policy. We then systematically study how causality varies with the number of parameters (and depth) and training steps in scaled models of up to 1.2 billion parameters, and we find similar scaling results to what we observe in the toy problem.

Abstract: While AI innovation accelerates rapidly, the intellectual process behind breakthroughs -- how researchers identify gaps, synthesize prior work, and generate insights -- remains poorly understood. The lack of structured data on scientific reasoning hinders systematic analysis and development of AI research agents. We introduce Sci-Reasoning, the first dataset capturing the intellectual synthesis behind high-quality AI research. Using community-validated quality signals and an LLM-accelerated, human-verified pipeline, we trace Oral and Spotlight papers across NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR (2023-2025) to its key predecessors, articulating specific reasoning links in a structured format. Our analysis identifies 15 distinct thinking patterns, with three dominant strategies accounting for 52.7%: Gap-Driven Reframing (24.2%), Cross-Domain Synthesis (18.0%), and Representation Shift (10.5%). The most powerful innovation recipes combine multiple patterns: Gap-Driven Reframing + Representation Shift, Cross-Domain Synthesis + Representation Shift, and Gap-Driven Reframing + Cross-Domain Synthesis. This dataset enables quantitative studies of scientific progress and provides structured reasoning trajectories for training the next generation AI research agents.

Abstract: Identifying deceptive content like phishing emails demands sophisticated cognitive processes that combine pattern recognition, confidence assessment, and contextual analysis. This research examines how human cognition and machine learning models work together to distinguish phishing emails from legitimate ones. We employed three interpretable algorithms Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests training them on both TF-IDF features and semantic embeddings, then compared their predictions against human evaluations that captured confidence ratings and linguistic observations. Our results show that machine learning models provide good accuracy rates, but their confidence levels vary significantly. Human evaluators, on the other hand, use a greater variety of language signs and retain more consistent confidence. We also found that while language proficiency has minimal effect on detection performance, aging does. These findings offer helpful direction for creating transparent AI systems that complement human cognitive functions, ultimately improving human-AI cooperation in challenging content analysis tasks.

TL;DR: AgentDevel将LLM智能体改进重新定义为发布工程，通过外部化回归感知的发布管道实现稳定可审计的改进


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体改进方法（如内置自改进机制或多版本并发搜索）虽然能提升整体得分，但会导致不稳定且难以审计的改进轨迹，无法保证非回归特性或跨版本故障分析

Method: 1）实现无关的LLM批评器，在不访问智能体内部实现的情况下从执行轨迹中生成症状层面的质量信号；2）基于脚本的可执行诊断，聚合主导症状模式并产生可审计的工程规范；3）翻转中心化的把关机制，将失败修复和防止回归作为核心评估标准

Result: 在执行密集型基准测试中，AgentDevel能以显著更少的回归实现稳定改进，同时产生可复现、可审计的制品

Conclusion: AgentDevel为构建、调试和发布LLM智能体提供了一种实用的软件开发纪律，将智能体作为可交付制品进行工程化管理

Abstract: Recent progress in large language model (LLM) agents has largely focused on embedding self-improvement mechanisms inside the agent or searching over many concurrent variants. While these approaches can raise aggregate scores, they often yield unstable and hard-to-audit improvement trajectories, making it difficult to guarantee non-regression or to reason about failures across versions. We reframe agent improvement as \textbf{release engineering}: agents are treated as shippable artifacts, and improvement is externalized into a regression-aware release pipeline. We introduce \textbf{AgentDevel}, a release engineering pipeline that iteratively runs the current agent, produces implementation-blind, symptom-level quality signals from execution traces, synthesizes a single release candidate (RC) via executable diagnosis, and promotes it under flip-centered gating. AgentDevel features three core designs: (i) an implementation-blind LLM critic that characterizes failure appearances without accessing agent internals, (ii) script-based executable diagnosis that aggregates dominant symptom patterns and produces auditable engineering specifications, and (iii) flip-centered gating that prioritizes pass to fail regressions and fail to pass fixes as first-class evidence. Unlike population-based search or in-agent self-refinement, AgentDevel maintains a single canonical version line and emphasizes non-regression as a primary objective. Experiments on execution-heavy benchmarks demonstrate that AgentDevel yields stable improvements with significantly fewer regressions while producing reproducible, auditable artifacts. Overall, AgentDevel provides a practical development discipline for building, debugging, and releasing LLM agents as software development.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities for analyzing social phenomena at scale. This paper demonstrates the value of LLMs in psychological measurement by (1) compiling the first large-scale dataset of election rumors on a niche alt-tech platform, (2) developing a multistage Rumor Detection Agent that leverages LLMs for high-precision content classification, and (3) quantifying the psychological dynamics of rumor propagation, specifically the "illusory truth effect" in a naturalistic setting. The Rumor Detection Agent combines (i) a synthetic data-augmented, fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier, (ii) precision keyword filtering, and (iii) a two-pass LLM verification pipeline using GPT-4o mini. The findings reveal that sharing probability rises steadily with each additional exposure, providing large-scale empirical evidence for dose-response belief reinforcement in ideologically homogeneous networks. Simulation results further demonstrate rapid contagion effects: nearly one quarter of users become "infected" within just four propagation iterations. Taken together, these results illustrate how LLMs can transform psychological science by enabling the rigorous measurement of belief dynamics and misinformation spread in massive, real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够在消费级计算机上运行的、基于LLM的自动定理证明器，解决Isabelle标准自动化工具（如Sledgehammer）无法证明的引理，探索LLM在形式化证明中的应用潜力

Method: 系统结合逐步证明器（使用LLM生成由Isabelle验证的证明命令的有限搜索循环）和高级证明规划器（生成结构化Isar大纲并填补修复剩余空缺）。关键技术包括战术的束搜索、战术重排的ML和RL模型、小型Transformer模型的前提选择、基于AFP的Isar证明微RAG，以及反例引导的证明修复

Result: IsabelleLM能够证明一些Isabelle标准自动化工具（包括Sledgehammer）无法证明的引理，展示了LLM引导的证明搜索的实际价值。但同时发现，即使最先进的LLM（如GPT 5.2 Extended Thinking和Gemini 3 Pro）也难以可靠地实现复杂的填充修复机制

Conclusion: IsabelleLM证明了LLM在定理证明中的实用价值，能够解决传统自动化工具难以处理的证明任务，但同时也揭示了LLM在代码生成和推理方面的根本性挑战，尤其是处理复杂算法设计时的局限性

Abstract: We present Isabellm, an LLM-powered theorem prover for Isabelle/HOL that performs fully automatic proof synthesis. Isabellm works with any local LLM on Ollama and APIs such as Gemini CLI, and it is designed to run on consumer grade computers. The system combines a stepwise prover, which uses large language models to propose proof commands validated by Isabelle in a bounded search loop, with a higher-level proof planner that generates structured Isar outlines and attempts to fill and repair remaining gaps. The framework includes beam search for tactics, tactics reranker ML and RL models, premise selection with small transformer models, micro-RAG for Isar proofs built from AFP, and counter-example guided proof repair. All the code is implemented by GPT 4.1 - 5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5. Empirically, Isabellm can prove certain lemmas that defeat Isabelle's standard automation, including Sledgehammer, demonstrating the practical value of LLM-guided proof search. At the same time, we find that even state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT 5.2 Extended Thinking and Gemini 3 Pro struggle to reliably implement the intended fill-and-repair mechanisms with complex algorithmic designs, highlighting fundamental challenges in LLM code generation and reasoning.

Method: 提出InstruCoT增强方法，合成多样化训练数据并采用指令级思维链进行微调，使LLM能有效识别和拒绝来自任何来源或上下文中任意位置的恶意指令。

Result: 在行为偏离、隐私泄露和有害输出三个关键维度上评估InstruCoT，四个LLM实验结果表明该方法在所有维度均显著超越基线，同时保持实用性能不下降。

Conclusion: InstruCoT提供了一种有效的提示注入防御方案，通过数据多样化和指令级思维链微调机制成功解决了多源注入和语义边界模糊的防御难题。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-integrated applications have become increasingly prevalent, yet face critical security vulnerabilities from prompt injection (PI) attacks. Defending against PI attacks faces two major issues: malicious instructions can be injected through diverse vectors, and injected instructions often lack clear semantic boundaries from the surrounding context, making them difficult to identify. To address these issues, we propose InstruCoT, a model enhancement method for PI defense that synthesizes diverse training data and employs instruction-level chain-of-thought fine-tuning, enabling LLMs to effectively identify and reject malicious instructions regardless of their source or position in the context. We evaluate InstruCoT across three critical dimensions: Behavior Deviation, Privacy Leakage, and Harmful Output. Experimental results across four LLMs demonstrate that InstruCoT significantly outperforms baselines in all dimensions while maintaining utility performance without degradation

Abstract: Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-based MAS), where multiple LLM agents collaborate to solve complex tasks, have shown impressive performance in many areas. However, MAS are typically distributed across different devices or environments, making them vulnerable to perturbations such as agent failures. While existing works have studied the adversarial attacks and corresponding defense strategies, they mainly focus on reactively detecting and mitigating attacks after they occur rather than proactively designing inherently resilient systems. In this work, we study the resilience of LLM-based MAS under perturbations and find that both the communication topology and prompt design significantly influence system resilience. Motivated by these findings, we propose ResMAS: a two-stage framework for enhancing MAS resilience. First, we train a reward model to predict the MAS's resilience, based on which we train a topology generator to automatically design resilient topology for specific tasks through reinforcement learning. Second, we introduce a topology-aware prompt optimization method that refines each agent's prompt based on its connections and interactions with other agents. Extensive experiments across a range of tasks show that our approach substantially improves MAS resilience under various constraints. Moreover, our framework demonstrates strong generalization ability to new tasks and models, highlighting its potential for building resilient MASs.

Abstract: We present Tape, a controlled reinforcement-learning benchmark designed to isolate out-of-distribution (OOD) failure under latent rule shifts.Tape is derived from one-dimensional cellular automata, enabling precise train/test splits where observation and action spaces are held fixed while transition rules change. Using a reproducible evaluation pipeline, we compare model-free baselines, model-based planning with learned world models, and task-inference (meta-RL) methods. A consistent pattern emerges: methods that are strong in-distribution (ID) can collapse under heldout-rule OOD, and high-variance OOD evaluation can make rankings unstable unless experiments are sufficiently replicated.We provide (i) standardized OOD protocols, (ii) statistical reporting requirements (seeds, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests), and (iii) information-theoretic identities connecting entropy reduction to conditional mutual information and expected posterior KL divergence, clarifying what "uncertainty reduction" objectives can and cannot guarantee under rule shifts.

Abstract: In the process of digital transformation, enterprises are faced with problems such as insufficient semantic understanding of unstructured data and lack of intelligent decision-making basis in driving mechanisms. This study proposes a method that combines a large language model (LLM) and a knowledge graph. First, a fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model is used to perform entity recognition and relationship extraction on multi-source heterogeneous texts, and GPT-4 is used to generate semantically enhanced vector representations; secondly, a two-layer graph neural network (GNN) architecture is designed to fuse the semantic vectors output by LLM with business metadata to construct a dynamic and scalable enterprise knowledge graph; then reinforcement learning is introduced to optimize decision path generation, and the reward function is used to drive the mechanism iteration. In the case of the manufacturing industry, this mechanism reduced the response time for equipment failure scenarios from 7.8 hours to 3.7 hours, the F1 value reached 94.3%, and the compensation for decision errors in the annual digital transformation cost decreased by 45.3%. This method significantly enhances the intelligence level and execution efficiency of the digital transformation driving mechanism by integrating large model semantic understanding with structured knowledge.

Abstract: Travel planning is a sophisticated decision-making process that requires synthesizing multifaceted information to construct itineraries. However, existing travel planning approaches face several challenges: (1) Pruning candidate points of interest (POIs) while maintaining a high recall rate; (2) A single reasoning path restricts the exploration capability within the feasible solution space for travel planning; (3) Simultaneously optimizing hard constraints and soft constraints remains a significant difficulty. To address these challenges, we propose TourPlanner, a comprehensive framework featuring multi-path reasoning and constraint-gated reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first introduce a Personalized Recall and Spatial Optimization (PReSO) workflow to construct spatially-aware candidate POIs' set. Subsequently, we propose Competitive consensus Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), a multi-path reasoning paradigm that improves the ability of exploring the feasible solution space. To further refine the plan, we integrate a sigmoid-based gating mechanism into the reinforcement learning stage, which dynamically prioritizes soft-constraint satisfaction only after hard constraints are met. Experimental results on travel planning benchmarks demonstrate that TourPlanner achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing existing methods in both feasibility and user-preference alignment.

Abstract: Agentic search has emerged as a promising paradigm for complex information seeking by enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to interleave reasoning with tool use. However, prevailing systems rely on monolithic agents that suffer from structural bottlenecks, including unconstrained reasoning outputs that inflate trajectories, sparse outcome-level rewards that complicate credit assignment, and stochastic search noise that destabilizes learning. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{M-ASK} (Multi-Agent Search and Knowledge), a framework that explicitly decouples agentic search into two complementary roles: Search Behavior Agents, which plan and execute search actions, and Knowledge Management Agents, which aggregate, filter, and maintain a compact internal context. This decomposition allows each agent to focus on a well-defined subtask and reduces interference between search and context construction. Furthermore, to enable stable coordination, M-ASK employs turn-level rewards to provide granular supervision for both search decisions and knowledge updates. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that M-ASK outperforms strong baselines, achieving not only superior answer accuracy but also significantly more stable training dynamics.\footnote{The source code for M-ASK is available at https://github.com/chenyiqun/M-ASK.}

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型基于离散token的架构与具有时间依赖性的连续数值序列存在根本性不兼容，限制了语言模型在事件管理工作流中的自动化潜力。需要进行模态对齐以解决这一不匹配问题。

Method: 提出了三个技术贡献：1）语义压缩技术，将时间片段压缩为单token抽象同时保留模式语义；2）使用门控交叉注意力将时间序列特征投影到语言模型潜在空间的对齐编码器；3）检索增强诊断流程，将对齐嵌入与历史事件知识结合进行故障归因。

Conclusion: 嵌入空间对齐是使语言模型能够在生产事件响应环境中对多模态遥测数据进行推理的有效策略。

Abstract: Root cause analysis in modern cloud infrastructure demands sophisticated understanding of heterogeneous data sources, particularly time-series performance metrics that involve core failure signatures. While large language models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in textual reasoning, their discrete token-based architecture creates fundamental incompatibilities with continuous numerical sequences exhibiting temporal dependencies. Current methodologies inadequately address this modality mismatch, constraining the potential of language model-driven automation in incident management workflows. This paper presents a multimodal diagnostic framework that harmonizes time-series representations with pretrained language model embedding spaces. Our approach contributes three technical advances: (1) a semantic compression technique that distills temporal segments into single-token abstractions while preserving pattern semantics, (2) an alignment encoder utilizing gated cross-attention to project time-series features into language model latent space, and (3) a retrieval-augmented diagnostic pipeline that synthesizes aligned embeddings with historical incident knowledge for expert-level failure attribution. Comprehensive evaluation across six cloud system benchmarks demonstrates that our framework achieves leading performance, reaching 48.75% diagnostic accuracy with notable improvements on scenarios involving compound failure modes. The results validate embedding-space alignment as an effective strategy for enabling language models to reason over multimodal telemetry data in production incident response contexts.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在自动驾驶领域的应用面临非结构化推理、泛化能力差以及与人类驾驶意图不匹配的问题。虽然CoT推理能提升决策透明度，但传统的监督微调未能充分利用其潜力，而强化学习方法存在不稳定性和推理深度不足的缺陷。

Method: 提出两阶段训练策略：1) 使用CoT解释进行监督微调（SFT）；2) 采用难度感知自适应策略优化器的渐进式强化学习（RL），根据样本复杂度动态调整学习强度。该框架通过显式推理与难度感知自适应策略优化的协同作用，实现端到端的优化。

Conclusion: ThinkDrive框架有效解决了自动驾驶决策中的推理和泛化问题，通过结合CoT引导和渐进式RL调优，在多个指标上实现了显著性能提升，甚至使较小模型超越了更大规模的预训练模型。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) technologies, their application in the domain of autonomous driving has become increasingly widespread. However, existing methods suffer from unstructured reasoning, poor generalization, and misalignment with human driving intent. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances decision transparency, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) fails to fully exploit its potential, and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches face instability and suboptimal reasoning depth. We propose ThinkDrive, a CoT guided progressive RL fine-tuning framework for autonomous driving that synergizes explicit reasoning with difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimization. Our method employs a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform SFT using CoT explanations. Then, we apply progressive RL with a difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimizer that dynamically adjusts learning intensity based on sample complexity. We evaluate our approach on a public dataset. The results show that ThinkDrive outperforms strong RL baselines by 1.45%, 1.95%, and 1.01% on exam, easy-exam, and accuracy, respectively. Moreover, a 2B-parameter model trained with our method surpasses the much larger GPT-4o by 3.28% on the exam metric.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as intelligent agents that reason, plan, and interact with their environments. To effectively scale to long-horizon scenarios, a key capability for such agents is a memory mechanism that can retain, organize, and retrieve past experiences to support downstream decision-making. However, most existing approaches organize and store memories in a flat manner and rely on simple similarity-based retrieval techniques. Even when structured memory is introduced, existing methods often struggle to explicitly capture the logical relationships among experiences or memory units. Moreover, memory access is largely detached from the constructed structure and still depends on shallow semantic retrieval, preventing agents from reasoning logically over long-horizon dependencies. In this work, we propose CompassMem, an event-centric memory framework inspired by Event Segmentation Theory. CompassMem organizes memory as an Event Graph by incrementally segmenting experiences into events and linking them through explicit logical relations. This graph serves as a logic map, enabling agents to perform structured and goal-directed navigation over memory beyond superficial retrieval, progressively gathering valuable memories to support long-horizon reasoning. Experiments on LoCoMo and NarrativeQA demonstrate that CompassMem consistently improves both retrieval and reasoning performance across multiple backbone models.

Abstract: Current critic-free RL methods for large reasoning models suffer from severe inefficiency when training on positive homogeneous prompts (where all rollouts are correct), resulting in waste of rollouts due to zero advantage estimates. We introduce a radically simple yet powerful solution to \uline{M}ine \uline{in}trinsic mast\uline{er}y (Miner), that repurposes the policy's intrinsic uncertainty as a self-supervised reward signal, with no external supervision, auxiliary models, or additional inference cost. Our method pioneers two key innovations: (1) a token-level focal credit assignment mechanism that dynamically amplifies gradients on critical uncertain tokens while suppressing overconfident ones, and (2) adaptive advantage calibration to seamlessly integrate intrinsic and verifiable rewards. Evaluated across six reasoning benchmarks on Qwen3-4B and Qwen3-8B base models, Miner achieves state-of-the-art performance among the other four algorithms, yielding up to \textbf{4.58} absolute gains in Pass@1 and \textbf{6.66} gains in Pass@K compared to GRPO. Comparison with other methods targeted at exploration enhancement further discloses the superiority of the two newly proposed innovations. This demonstrates that latent uncertainty exploitation is both necessary and sufficient for efficient and scalable RL training of reasoning models.

We present \BenchName, a publicly releasable benchmark built from long-form autobiographical narratives, where actions, context, and inner thoughts provide dense evidence for inferring stable motivations and decision principles. \BenchName~reconstructs each narrative into a flashback-aware, time-anchored stream and evaluates models with evidence-linked questions spanning factual recall, subjective state attribution, and principle-level reasoning. Across diverse narrative sources, retrieval-augmented systems mainly improve factual accuracy, while errors persist on temporally grounded explanations and higher-level inferences, highlighting the need for memory mechanisms beyond retrieval.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective for knowledge synthesis, yet it encounters significant challenges in practical scenarios where data is inherently discrete and fragmented. In most environments, information is distributed across isolated files like reports and logs that lack explicit links. Standard search engines process files independently, ignoring the connections between them. Furthermore, manually building Knowledge Graphs is impractical for such vast data. To bridge this gap, we present Orion-RAG. Our core insight is simple yet effective: we do not need heavy algorithms to organize this data. Instead, we use a low-complexity strategy to extract lightweight paths that naturally link related concepts. We demonstrate that this streamlined approach suffices to transform fragmented documents into semi-structured data, enabling the system to link information across different files effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Orion-RAG consistently outperforms mainstream frameworks across diverse domains, supporting real-time updates and explicit Human-in-the-Loop verification with high cost-efficiency. Experiments on FinanceBench demonstrate superior precision with a 25.2% relative improvement over strong baselines.

Abstract: LLM agents have emerged as powerful systems for tackling multi-turn tasks by interleaving internal reasoning and external tool interactions. Agentic Reinforcement Learning has recently drawn significant research attention as a critical post-training paradigm to further refine these capabilities. In this paper, we present AT$^2$PO (Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization via Tree Search), a unified framework for multi-turn agentic RL that addresses three core challenges: limited exploration diversity, sparse credit assignment, and misaligned policy optimization. AT$^2$PO introduces a turn-level tree structure that jointly enables Entropy-Guided Tree Expansion for strategic exploration and Turn-wise Credit Assignment for fine-grained reward propagation from sparse outcomes. Complementing this, we propose Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization, a turn-level learning objective that aligns policy updates with the natural decision granularity of agentic interactions. ATPO is orthogonal to tree search and can be readily integrated into any multi-turn RL pipeline. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline by up to 1.84 percentage points in average, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component. Our code is available at https://github.com/zzfoutofspace/ATPO.

Abstract: Designing academic posters is a labor-intensive process requiring the precise balance of high-density content and sophisticated layout. While existing paper-to-poster generation methods automate initial drafting, they are typically single-pass and non-interactive, often fail to align with complex, subjective user intent. To bridge this gap, we propose APEX (Academic Poster Editing agentic eXpert), the first agentic framework for interactive academic poster editing, supporting fine-grained control with robust multi-level API-based editing and a review-and-adjustment Mechanism. In addition, we introduce APEX-Bench, the first systematic benchmark comprising 514 academic poster editing instructions, categorized by a multi-dimensional taxonomy including operation type, difficulty, and abstraction level, constructed via reference-guided and reference-free strategies to ensure realism and diversity. We further establish a multi-dimensional VLM-as-a-judge evaluation protocol to assess instruction fulfillment, modification scope, and visual consistency & harmony. Experimental results demonstrate that APEX significantly outperforms baseline methods. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Breesiu/APEX.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have attracted much attention due to their exceptional performance. However, their performance mainly stems from thinking, a long Chain of Thought (CoT), which significantly increase computational overhead. To address this overthinking problem, existing work focuses on using reinforcement learning (RL) to train hybrid reasoning models that automatically decide whether to engage in thinking or not based on the complexity of the query. Unfortunately, using RL will suffer the the reward hacking problem, e.g., the model engages in thinking but is judged as not doing so, resulting in incorrect rewards. To mitigate this problem, existing works either employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which incurs high computational costs, or enforce uniform token limits on non-thinking responses, which yields limited mitigation of the problem. In this paper, we propose Thinking-Based Non-Thinking (TNT). It does not employ SFT, and sets different maximum token usage for responses not using thinking across various queries by leveraging information from the solution component of the responses using thinking. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that TNT reduces token usage by around 50% compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B/7B and DeepScaleR-1.5B, while significantly improving accuracy. In fact, TNT achieves the optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among all tested methods. Additionally, the probability of reward hacking problem in TNT's responses, which are classified as not using thinking, remains below 10% across all tested datasets.

TL;DR: SCALER是一个通过自适应环境设计维持有效强化学习信号的框架，用于提升语言模型的推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的方法在提升语言模型推理能力时，常因任务难度与模型能力不匹配或训练被少数重复模式主导而导致训练信号失效，需要一种能持续提供有效学习信号的解决方案。

Method: SCALER包含两个核心组件：1) 可扩展的合成流水线，将真实编程问题转化为具有可控难度和无限制实例生成的、可验证的推理环境；2) 自适应多环境强化学习策略，能动态调整实例难度并主动管理环境集合以追踪模型能力边界并保持分布多样性。

Result: 大量实验表明，SCALER在多个推理基准测试中一致优于基于数据集的强化学习基线方法，并展现出更稳定、更长周期的训练动态。

Conclusion: SCALER框架通过环境合成和自适应训练的联合设计，有效解决了强化学习中训练信号退化的关键问题，为语言模型的推理能力提供了可持续的改进机制。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled way to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models, yet its effectiveness hinges on training signals that remain informative as models evolve. In practice, RL progress often slows when task difficulty becomes poorly aligned with model capability, or when training is dominated by a narrow set of recurring problem patterns. To jointly address these issues, we propose SCALER (Synthetic sCalable Adaptive Learning Environment for Reasoning), a framework that sustains effective learning signals through adaptive environment design. SCALER introduces a scalable synthesis pipeline that converts real-world programming problems into verifiable reasoning environments with controllable difficulty and unbounded instance generation, enabling RL training beyond finite datasets while preserving strong correctness guarantees. Building on this, SCALER further employs an adaptive multi-environment RL strategy that dynamically adjusts instance difficulty and curates the active set of environments to track the model's capability frontier and maintain distributional diversity. This co-adaptation prevents reward sparsity, mitigates overfitting to narrow task patterns, and supports sustained improvement throughout training. Extensive experiments show that SCALER consistently outperforms dataset-based RL baselines across diverse reasoning benchmarks and exhibits more stable, long-horizon training dynamics.

Abstract: AEC drawings encode geometry and semantics through symbols, layout conventions, and dense annotation, yet it remains unclear whether modern multimodal and vision-language models can reliably interpret this graphical language. We present AECV-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal and vision-language models on realistic AEC artefacts via two complementary use cases: (i) object counting on 120 high-quality floor plans (doors, windows, bedrooms, toilets), and (ii) drawing-grounded document QA spanning 192 question-answer pairs that test text extraction (OCR), instance counting, spatial reasoning, and comparative reasoning over common drawing regions. Object-counting performance is reported using per-field exact-match accuracy and MAPE results, while document-QA performance is reported using overall accuracy and per-category breakdowns with an LLM-as-a-judge scoring pipeline and targeted human adjudication for edge cases. Evaluating a broad set of state-of-the-art models under a unified protocol, we observe a stable capability gradient; OCR and text-centric document QA are strongest (up to 0.95 accuracy), spatial reasoning is moderate, and symbol-centric drawing understanding - especially reliable counting of doors and windows - remains unsolved (often 0.40-0.55 accuracy) with substantial proportional errors. These results suggest that current systems function well as document assistants but lack robust drawing literacy, motivating domain-specific representations and tool-augmented, human-in-the-loop workflows for an efficient AEC automation.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a prominent paradigm for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs). Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA, is widely adopted to adapt pretrained MoE LLMs to downstream tasks. However, existing approaches assign identical LoRA ranks to all experts, overlooking the intrinsic functional specialization within MoE LLMs. This uniform allocation leads to resource mismatch, task-relevant experts are under-provisioned while less relevant ones receive redundant parameters. We propose a Dynamic Rank LoRA framework named DR-LoRA, which dynamically grows expert LoRA ranks during fine-tuning based on task-specific demands. DR-LoRA employs an Expert Saliency Scoring mechanism that integrates expert routing frequency and LoRA rank importance to quantify each expert's demand for additional capacity. Experts with higher saliency scores are prioritized for rank expansion, enabling the automatic formation of a heterogeneous rank distribution tailored to the target task. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DR-LoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA and static allocation strategies under the same parameter budget, achieving superior task performance with more efficient parameter utilization.

Abstract: While multi-agent systems (MAS) have demonstrated superior performance over single-agent approaches in complex reasoning tasks, they often suffer from significant computational inefficiencies. Existing frameworks typically deploy large language models (LLMs) uniformly across all agent roles, failing to account for the varying cognitive demands of different reasoning stages. We address this inefficiency by proposing OI-MAS framework, a novel multi-agent framework that implements an adaptive model-selection policy across a heterogeneous pool of multi-scale LLMs. Specifically, OI-MAS introduces a state-dependent routing mechanism that dynamically selects agent roles and model scales throughout the reasoning process. In addition, we introduce a confidence-aware mechanism that selects appropriate model scales conditioned on task complexity, thus reducing unnecessary reliance on large-scale models. Experimental results show that OI-MAS consistently outperforms baseline multi-agent systems, improving accuracy by up to 12.88\% while reducing cost by up to 79.78\%.

Abstract: Continual learning aims to enable models to acquire new knowledge while retaining previously learned information. Prompt-based methods have shown remarkable performance in this domain; however, they typically rely on key-value pairing, which can introduce inter-task interference and hinder scalability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach employing task-specific Prompt-Prototype (ProP), thereby eliminating the need for key-value pairs. In our method, task-specific prompts facilitate more effective feature learning for the current task, while corresponding prototypes capture the representative features of the input. During inference, predictions are generated by binding each task-specific prompt with its associated prototype. Additionally, we introduce regularization constraints during prompt initialization to penalize excessively large values, thereby enhancing stability. Experiments on several widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In contrast to mainstream prompt-based approaches, our framework removes the dependency on key-value pairs, offering a fresh perspective for future continual learning research.

Abstract: Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) are pivotal in optimizing production processes in today's rapidly evolving manufacturing landscape. This paper advances the traditional job shop scheduling problem by incorporating additional complexities through the simultaneous integration of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and tool-sharing systems. We propose a novel approach that combines Colored-Timed Petri Nets (CTPNs) with actor-critic model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), effectively addressing the multifaceted challenges associated with FMS. CTPNs provide a formal modeling structure and dynamic action masking, significantly reducing the action search space, while MBRL ensures adaptability to changing environments through the learned policy. Leveraging the advantages of MBRL, we incorporate a lookahead strategy for optimal positioning of AGVs, improving operational efficiency. Our approach was evaluated on small-sized public benchmarks and a newly developed large-scale benchmark inspired by the Taillard benchmark. The results show that our approach matches traditional methods on smaller instances and outperforms them on larger ones in terms of makespan while achieving a tenfold reduction in computation time. To ensure reproducibility, we propose a gym-compatible environment and an instance generator. Additionally, an ablation study evaluates the contribution of each framework component to its overall performance.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based search agents have proven promising for addressing knowledge-intensive problems by incorporating information retrieval capabilities. Existing works largely focus on optimizing the reasoning paradigms of search agents, yet the quality of intermediate search queries during reasoning remains overlooked. As a result, the generated queries often remain inaccurate, leading to unexpected retrieval results and ultimately limiting search agents' overall effectiveness. To mitigate this issue, we introduce SmartSearch, a framework built upon two key mechanisms: (1) Process rewards, which provide fine-grained supervision for the quality of each intermediate search query through Dual-Level Credit Assessment. (2) Query refinement, which promotes the optimization of query generation by selectively refining low-quality search queries and regenerating subsequent search rounds based on these refinements. To enable the search agent to progressively internalize the ability to improve query quality under the guidance of process rewards, we design a three-stage curriculum learning framework. This framework guides the agent through a progression from imitation, to alignment, and ultimately to generalization. Experimental results show that SmartSearch consistently surpasses existing baselines, and additional quantitative analyses further confirm its significant gains in both search efficiency and query quality. The code is available at https://github.com/MYVAE/SmartSearch.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型评估中存在变体污染问题：训练语料包含测试项的语义等价但词汇/句法变体，这些变体逃逸现有检测器，致使基准分数因记忆而非真实推理而虚高。

Method: 提出DVD（基于生成分布方差的检测）方法，通过温度采样诱导局部输出分布，建模污染项在记忆保持状态和扰动漂移状态间的交替，导致低概率代币的人工困难性出现异常高方差。

Result: 为变体污染构建首个跨领域基准（Omni-MATH和SuperGPQA），通过微调不同规模架构模型（Qwen2.5和Llama3.1）模拟污染。结果表明DVD在跨数据集和模型上优于基于困惑度、Min-k%++、编辑距离（CDD）和嵌入相似性的基线方法，且对超参数具有较强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 生成分布的方差可作为检测LLM评估中变体污染的原则性实用指纹，DVD方法为可靠评估大语言模型的真实能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is increasingly confounded by \emph{variant contamination}: the training corpus contains semantically equivalent yet lexically or syntactically altered versions of test items. Unlike verbatim leakage, these paraphrased or structurally transformed variants evade existing detectors based on sampling consistency or perplexity, thereby inflating benchmark scores via memorization rather than genuine reasoning. We formalize this problem and introduce \textbf{DVD} (\textbf{D}etection via \textbf{V}ariance of generation \textbf{D}istribution), a single-sample detector that models the local output distribution induced by temperature sampling. Our key insight is that contaminated items trigger alternation between a \emph{memory-adherence} state and a \emph{perturbation-drift} state, yielding abnormally high variance in the synthetic difficulty of low-probability tokens; uncontaminated items remain in drift with comparatively smooth variance. We construct the first benchmark for variant contamination across two domains Omni-MATH and SuperGPQA by generating and filtering semantically equivalent variants, and simulate contamination via fine-tuning models of different scales and architectures (Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1). Across datasets and models, \textbf{DVD} consistently outperforms perplexity-based, Min-$k$\%++, edit-distance (CDD), and embedding-similarity baselines, while exhibiting strong robustness to hyperparameters. Our results establish variance of the generation distribution as a principled and practical fingerprint for detecting variant contamination in LLM evaluation.

Abstract: The primary objective of a diverse planning approach is to generate a set of plans that are distinct from one another. Such an approach is applied in a variety of real-world domains, including risk management, automated stream data analysis, and malware detection. More recently, a novel diverse planning paradigm, referred to as behaviour planning, has been proposed. This approach extends earlier methods by explicitly incorporating a diversity model into the planning process and supporting multiple planning categories. In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of behaviour planning in real-world settings by presenting three case studies. The first case study focuses on storytelling, the second addresses urban planning, and the third examines game evaluation.

Motivation: 学习分析仪表板旨在通过数据反馈支持学生学习调节，但学生（尤其是自我调节学习能力较低者）常难以有效参与和理解分析反馈。生成式AI助手通过实时、个性化、基于对话的支持展现出辅助潜力，本研究旨在深入探讨这种潜力。

Method: 在10周学期中将生成式AI助手整合到学习分析仪表板中，收集学生与AI助手的真实对话数据，通过分析不同SRL水平学生的提问类型、AI回答的相关性和质量，以及学生对助手作用的感知来开展研究。

Result: 发现不同SRL水平学生的提问模式存在差异：低SRL学生寻求澄清和安慰，高SRL学生询问技术细节和个性化策略。AI助手能提供清晰可靠的解释，但在个性化、处理情感化查询以及整合多数据点进行定制回复方面存在局限。研究发现GenAI干预对低SRL学生尤其有价值，可提供脚手架支持其参与反馈并缩小与高SRL同伴的差距。学生反思强调了信任的重要性，以及未来系统需要更强的适应性、情境感知和技术改进。

Abstract: Learning analytics dashboards (LADs) aim to support students' regulation of learning by translating complex data into feedback. Yet students, especially those with lower self-regulated learning (SRL) competence, often struggle to engage with and interpret analytics feedback. Conversational generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) assistants have shown potential to scaffold this process through real-time, personalised, dialogue-based support. Further advancing this potential, we explored authentic dialogues between students and GenAI assistant integrated into LAD during a 10-week semester. The analysis focused on questions students with different SRL levels posed, the relevance and quality of the assistant's answers, and how students perceived the assistant's role in their learning. Findings revealed distinct query patterns. While low SRL students sought clarification and reassurance, high SRL students queried technical aspects and requested personalised strategies. The assistant provided clear and reliable explanations but limited in personalisation, handling emotionally charged queries, and integrating multiple data points for tailored responses. Findings further extend that GenAI interventions can be especially valuable for low SRL students, offering scaffolding that supports engagement with feedback and narrows gaps with their higher SRL peers. At the same time, students' reflections underscored the importance of trust, need for greater adaptivity, context-awareness, and technical refinement in future systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as coding partners, yet their role in accelerating scientific discovery remains underexplored. This paper presents a case study of using ChatGPT for rapid prototyping in ESA's ELOPE (Event-based Lunar OPtical flow Egomotion estimation) competition. The competition required participants to process event camera data to estimate lunar lander trajectories. Despite joining late, we achieved second place with a score of 0.01282, highlighting the potential of human-AI collaboration in competitive scientific settings. ChatGPT contributed not only executable code but also algorithmic reasoning, data handling routines, and methodological suggestions, such as using fixed number of events instead of fixed time spans for windowing. At the same time, we observed limitations: the model often introduced unnecessary structural changes, gets confused by intermediate discussions about alternative ideas, occasionally produced critical errors and forgets important aspects in longer scientific discussions. By analyzing these strengths and shortcomings, we show how conversational AI can both accelerate development and support conceptual insight in scientific research. We argue that structured integration of LLMs into the scientific workflow can enhance rapid prototyping by proposing best practices for AI-assisted scientific work.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly enhanced Large Language Models' ability to access external knowledge, yet current graph-based RAG approaches face two critical limitations in managing hierarchical information: they impose rigid layer-specific compression quotas that damage local graph structures, and they prioritize topological structure while neglecting semantic content. We introduce T-Retriever, a novel framework that reformulates attributed graph retrieval as tree-based retrieval using a semantic and structure-guided encoding tree. Our approach features two key innovations: (1) Adaptive Compression Encoding, which replaces artificial compression quotas with a global optimization strategy that preserves the graph's natural hierarchical organization, and (2) Semantic-Structural Entropy ($S^2$-Entropy), which jointly optimizes for both structural cohesion and semantic consistency when creating hierarchical partitions. Experiments across diverse graph reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that T-Retriever significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG methods, providing more coherent and contextually relevant responses to complex queries.

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）通过大量思维链（CoT）生成来支持复杂认知行为，但存在‘过度思考’问题，即产生冗余推理路径增加计算成本却不提升准确性。现有方法在压缩推理轨迹时要么损害逻辑连贯性，要么采样成本过高。

Method: 提出ConMax（置信度最大化压缩）强化学习框架，将压缩过程建模为奖励驱动的优化问题：训练一个策略来剪枝冗余，通过最大化由冻结辅助LRM计算的答案置信度（预测保真度）和思考置信度（推理有效性）的加权组合来评估压缩质量。

Result: 在五个推理数据集上的实验表明，ConMax在效率-性能权衡方面优于基线：推理长度减少43%，准确性仅下降0.7%。

Conclusion: ConMax能生成高质量、高效的LRM训练数据，有效解决过度思考问题，为推理轨迹压缩提供了强化学习的新途径。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated that extensive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation is critical for enabling intricate cognitive behaviors, such as self-verification and backtracking, to solve complex tasks. However, this capability often leads to ``overthinking'', where models generate redundant reasoning paths that inflate computational costs without improving accuracy. While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on reasoning traces is a standard paradigm for the 'cold start' phase, applying existing compression techniques to these traces often compromises logical coherence or incurs prohibitive sampling costs. In this paper, we introduce ConMax (Confidence-Maximizing Compression), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to automatically compress reasoning traces while preserving essential reasoning patterns. ConMax formulates compression as a reward-driven optimization problem, training a policy to prune redundancy by maximizing a weighted combination of answer confidence for predictive fidelity and thinking confidence for reasoning validity through a frozen auxiliary LRM. Extensive experiments across five reasoning datasets demonstrate that ConMax achieves a superior efficiency-performance trade-off. Specifically, it reduces inference length by 43% over strong baselines at the cost of a mere 0.7% dip in accuracy, proving its effectiveness in generating high-quality, efficient training data for LRMs.

Abstract: Reasoning ability has become a central focus in the advancement of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Although notable progress has been achieved on several reasoning benchmarks such as MATH500 and LiveCodeBench, existing benchmarks for algorithmic reasoning remain limited, failing to answer a critical question: Do LRMs truly master algorithmic reasoning? To answer this question, we propose AlgBench, an expert-curated benchmark that evaluates LRMs under an algorithm-centric paradigm.
  AlgBench consists of over 3,000 original problems spanning 27 algorithms, constructed by ACM algorithmic experts and organized under a comprehensive taxonomy, including Euclidean-structured, non-Euclidean-structured, non-optimized, local-optimized, global-optimized, and heuristic-optimized categories. Empirical evaluations on leading LRMs (e.g., Gemini-3-Pro, DeepSeek-v3.2-Speciale and GPT-o3) reveal substantial performance heterogeneity: while models perform well on non-optimized tasks (up to 92%), accuracy drops sharply to around 49% on globally optimized algorithms such as dynamic programming. Further analysis uncovers \textbf{strategic over-shifts}, wherein models prematurely abandon correct algorithmic designs due to necessary low-entropy tokens. These findings expose fundamental limitations of problem-centric reinforcement learning and highlight the necessity of an algorithm-centric training paradigm for robust algorithmic reasoning.

Abstract: We investigate how large language models (LLMs) fail when tabular data in an otherwise canonical representation is subjected to semantic and structural distortions. Our findings reveal that LLMs lack an inherent ability to detect and correct subtle distortions in table representations. Only when provided with an explicit prior, via a system prompt, do models partially adjust their reasoning strategies and correct some distortions, though not consistently or completely. To study this phenomenon, we introduce a small, expert-curated dataset that explicitly evaluates LLMs on table question answering (TQA) tasks requiring an additional error-correction step prior to analysis. Our results reveal systematic differences in how LLMs ingest and interpret tabular information under distortion, with even SoTA models such as GPT-5.2 model exhibiting a drop of minimum 22% accuracy under distortion. These findings raise important questions for future research, particularly regarding when and how models should autonomously decide to realign tabular inputs, analogous to human behavior, without relying on explicit prompts or tabular data pre-processing.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves generation quality by incorporating evidence retrieved from large external corpora. However, most existing methods rely on statically selecting top-k passages based on individual relevance, which fails to exploit combinatorial gains among passages and often introduces substantial redundancy. To address this limitation, we propose OptiSet, a set-centric framework that unifies set selection and set-level ranking for RAG. OptiSet adopts an "Expand-then-Refine" paradigm: it first expands a query into multiple perspectives to enable a diverse candidate pool and then refines the candidate pool via re-selection to form a compact evidence set. We then devise a self-synthesis strategy without strong LLM supervision to derive preference labels from the set conditional utility changes of the generator, thereby identifying complementary and redundant evidence. Finally, we introduce a set-list wise training strategy that jointly optimizes set selection and set-level ranking, enabling the model to favor compact, high-gain evidence sets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiSet improves performance on complex combinatorial problems and makes generation more efficient. The source code is publicly available.

Abstract: The concept of Critical Batch Size, as pioneered by OpenAI, has long served as a foundational principle for large-scale pre-training. However, with the paradigm shift towards the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler, we observe that the original theoretical framework and its underlying mechanisms fail to align with new pre-training dynamics. To bridge this gap between theory and practice, this paper derives a revised E(S) relationship tailored for WSD scheduler, characterizing the trade-off between training data consumption E and steps S during pre-training. Our theoretical analysis reveals two fundamental properties of WSD-based pre-training: 1) B_min, the minimum batch size threshold required to achieve a target loss, and 2) B_opt, the optimal batch size that maximizes data efficiency by minimizing total tokens. Building upon these properties, we propose a dynamic Batch Size Scheduler. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our revised formula precisely captures the dynamics of large-scale pre-training, and the resulting scheduling strategy significantly enhances both training efficiency and final model quality.

Abstract: Optimal configuration of the learning rate (LR) is a fundamental yet formidable challenge in large-scale pre-training. Given the stringent trade-off between training costs and model performance, the pivotal question is whether the optimal LR can be accurately extrapolated from low-cost experiments. In this paper, we formalize this investigation into two distinct research paradigms: Fitting and Transfer. Within the Fitting Paradigm, we innovatively introduce a Scaling Law for search factor, effectively reducing the search complexity from O(n^3) to O(n*C_D*C_η) via predictive modeling. Within the Transfer Paradigm, we extend the principles of $μ$Transfer to the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, broadening its applicability to encompass model depth, weight decay, and token horizons. By pushing the boundaries of existing hyperparameter research in terms of scale, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between these two paradigms. Our empirical results challenge the scalability of the widely adopted $μ$ Transfer in large-scale pre-training scenarios. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous analysis through the dual lenses of training stability and feature learning to elucidate the underlying reasons why module-wise parameter tuning underperforms in large-scale settings. This work offers systematic practical guidelines and a fresh theoretical perspective for optimizing industrial-level pre-training.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs（如GPT-4o）在辩论中既能有效减少也能增加阴谋论信念，标准版与去护栏版效果相似，但通过准确性提示和纠偏对话可以缓解风险


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs的说服力是偏向真理还是同等促进错误信念，评估其促进阴谋论的风险及缓解方案的可行性

Method: 三个预注册实验让2724名美国参与者与GPT-4o讨论他们不确定的阴谋论，模型被指示“反驳”（debunking）或“支持”（bunking）该理论；使用标准版和去护栏版（jailbroken）GPT-4o，并测试准确性提示和纠偏对话的效果

Result: 1. 去护栏版GPT-4o在增加和减少阴谋论信念上同样有效；2. 支持阴谋论的AI获得更积极评价并增加对AI的信任；3. 标准版GPT-4o产生类似效果，OpenAI的护栏未能有效阻止其促进阴谋论；4. 纠偏对话能逆转新诱导的信念，准确性提示显著降低其增加阴谋论信念的能力

Conclusion: LLMs具备同等促进真理和虚假信息的强大能力，存在潜在风险，但通过准确性约束和后续纠偏对话等方案可能缓解这一风险

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to be persuasive across a variety of context. But it remains unclear whether this persuasive power advantages truth over falsehood, or if LLMs can promote misbeliefs just as easily as refuting them. Here, we investigate this question across three pre-registered experiments in which participants (N = 2,724 Americans) discussed a conspiracy theory they were uncertain about with GPT-4o, and the model was instructed to either argue against ("debunking") or for ("bunking") that conspiracy. When using a "jailbroken" GPT-4o variant with guardrails removed, the AI was as effective at increasing conspiracy belief as decreasing it. Concerningly, the bunking AI was rated more positively, and increased trust in AI, more than the debunking AI. Surprisingly, we found that using standard GPT-4o produced very similar effects, such that the guardrails imposed by OpenAI did little to revent the LLM from promoting conspiracy beliefs. Encouragingly, however, a corrective conversation reversed these newly induced conspiracy beliefs, and simply prompting GPT-4o to only use accurate information dramatically reduced its ability to increase conspiracy beliefs. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs possess potent abilities to promote both truth and falsehood, but that potential solutions may exist to help mitigate this risk.

Abstract: Scientific reviews are central to knowledge integration in materials science, yet their key insights remain locked in narrative text and static PDF tables, limiting reuse by humans and machines alike. This article presents a case study in atomic layer deposition and etching (ALD/E) where we publish review tables as FAIR, machine-actionable comparisons in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), turning them into structured, queryable knowledge. Building on this, we contrast symbolic querying over ORKG with large language model-based querying, and argue that a curated symbolic layer should remain the backbone of reliable neurosymbolic AI in materials science, with LLMs serving as complementary, symbolically grounded interfaces rather than standalone sources of truth.

Motivation: 现有的基于MCTS的RLVR方法（如GRPO）存在探索多样性不足和推理效率低下的问题，需要更有效的推理增强方案。

Method: 提出ROSE方法：1）语义熵分支策略：基于已采样推理路径的语义不确定性选择分歧点生成新路径；2）ε探索机制：从根节点随机启动推理路径避免局部搜索；3）长度感知段级优势估计器：奖励简洁正确推理，惩罚冗长链条。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，使用Qwen和Llama模型验证了ROSE的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: ROSE通过语义多样化探索和效率优化机制，显著提升了LLMs在强化学习验证奖励框架下的推理性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in enhancing the reasoning of large language models (LLMs). Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based extensions improve upon vanilla RLVR (e.g., GRPO) by providing tree-based reasoning rollouts that enable fine-grained and segment-level credit assignment. However, existing methods still suffer from limited exploration diversity and inefficient reasoning. To address the above challenges, we propose reinforced efficient reasoning via semantically diverse explorations, i.e., ROSE, for LLMs. To encourage more diverse reasoning exploration, our method incorporates a semantic-entropy-based branching strategy and an $\varepsilon$-exploration mechanism. The former operates on already sampled reasoning rollouts to capture semantic uncertainty and select branching points with high semantic divergence to generate new successive reasoning paths, whereas the latter stochastically initiates reasoning rollouts from the root, preventing the search process from becoming overly local. To improve efficiency, we design a length-aware segment-level advantage estimator that rewards concise and correct reasoning while penalizing unnecessarily long reasoning chains. Extensive experiments on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Qwen and Llama models validate the effectiveness and efficiency of ROSE. Codes are available at https://github.com/ZiqiZhao1/ROSE-rl.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) improve performance, reliability, and interpretability by generating explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, but this transparency introduces a serious privacy risk: intermediate reasoning often leaks personally identifiable information (PII) even when final answers are sanitized. We study how to induce privacy-first reasoning, where models reason without exposing sensitive information, using deployable interventions rather than post-hoc redaction. We introduce PII-CoT-Bench, a supervised dataset with privacy-aware CoT annotations, and a category-balanced evaluation benchmark covering realistic and adversarial leakage scenarios. Our results reveal a capability-dependent trend: state-of-the-art models benefit most from prompt-based controls, whereas weaker models require fine-tuning to achieve meaningful leakage reduction. Across models and categories, both approaches substantially reduce PII exposure with minimal degradation in utility, demonstrating that private reasoning can be achieved without sacrificing performance. Overall, we show that private CoT reasoning can be achieved with minimal utility loss, providing practical guidance for building privacy-preserving reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now integral to numerous industries, increasingly serving as the core reasoning engine for autonomous agents that perform complex tasks through tool-use. While the development of Arabic-native LLMs is accelerating, the benchmarks for evaluating their capabilities lag behind, with most existing frameworks focusing on English. A critical and overlooked area is tool-calling, where the performance of models prompted in non-English languages like Arabic is poorly understood, especially since these models are often pretrained on predominantly English data. This paper addresses this critical gap by introducing the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating the tool-calling and agentic capabilities of LLMs in the Arabic language. Our work provides a standardized framework to measure the functional accuracy and robustness of models in Arabic agentic workflows. Our findings reveal a huge performance gap: when users interact in Arabic, tool-calling accuracy drops by an average of 5-10\%, regardless of whether the tool descriptions themselves are in Arabic or English. By shedding light on these critical challenges, this benchmark aims to foster the development of more reliable and linguistically equitable AI agents for Arabic-speaking users.

Conclusion: FusionRoute通过路由器选择性调用专家并贡献互补信号，实现了效率与泛化的平衡，为多LLM协作提供了理论支撑和有效方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strengths across diverse domains. However, achieving strong performance across these domains with a single general-purpose model typically requires scaling to sizes that are prohibitively expensive to train and deploy. On the other hand, while smaller domain-specialized models are much more efficient, they struggle to generalize beyond their training distributions. To address this dilemma, we propose FusionRoute, a robust and effective token-level multi-LLM collaboration framework in which a lightweight router simultaneously (i) selects the most suitable expert at each decoding step and (ii) contributes a complementary logit that refines or corrects the selected expert's next-token distribution via logit addition. Unlike existing token-level collaboration methods that rely solely on fixed expert outputs, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that pure expert-only routing is fundamentally limited: unless strong global coverage assumptions hold, it cannot in general realize the optimal decoding policy. By augmenting expert selection with a trainable complementary generator, FusionRoute expands the effective policy class and enables recovery of optimal value functions under mild conditions. Empirically, across both Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families and diverse benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, and instruction following, FusionRoute outperforms both sequence- and token-level collaboration, model merging, and direct fine-tuning, while remaining competitive with domain experts on their respective tasks.

Abstract: As LLM-based agents are increasingly used in long-term interactions, cumulative memory is critical for enabling personalization and maintaining stylistic consistency. However, most existing systems adopt an ``all-or-nothing'' approach to memory usage: incorporating all relevant past information can lead to \textit{Memory Anchoring}, where the agent is trapped by past interactions, while excluding memory entirely results in under-utilization and the loss of important interaction history. We show that an agent's reliance on memory can be modeled as an explicit and user-controllable dimension. We first introduce a behavioral metric of memory dependence to quantify the influence of past interactions on current outputs. We then propose \textbf{Stee}rable \textbf{M}emory Agent, \texttt{SteeM}, a framework that allows users to dynamically regulate memory reliance, ranging from a fresh-start mode that promotes innovation to a high-fidelity mode that closely follows interaction history. Experiments across different scenarios demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms conventional prompting and rigid memory masking strategies, yielding a more nuanced and effective control for personalized human-agent collaboration.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve remarkable performance by explicitly generating multi-step chains of thought, but this capability incurs substantial inference latency and computational cost. Collaborative inference offers a promising solution by selectively allocating work between lightweight and large models, yet a fundamental challenge remains: determining when a reasoning step requires the capacity of a large model or the efficiency of a small model. Existing routing strategies either rely on local token probabilities or post-hoc verification, introducing significant inference overhead. In this work, we propose a novel perspective on step-wise collaboration: the difficulty of a reasoning step can be inferred from its very first token. Inspired by the "Aha Moment" phenomenon in LRMs, we show that the entropy of the initial token serves as a strong predictor of step difficulty. Building on this insight, we introduce GlimpRouter, a training-free step-wise collaboration framework. GlimpRouter employs a lightweight model to generate only the first token of each reasoning step and routes the step to a larger model only when the initial token entropy exceeds a threshold. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces inference latency while preserving accuracy. For instance, GlimpRouter attains a substantial 10.7% improvement in accuracy while reducing inference latency by 25.9% compared to a standalone large model on AIME25. These results suggest a simple yet effective mechanism for reasoning: allocating computation based on a glimpse of thought rather than full-step evaluation.

TL;DR: LLM-as-judge评估系统存在可靠性悖论：不同法官模型间一致性几乎为零，但每个模型自身高度一致，形成了可识别的'评估倾向指纹'，表明它们不是可互换的测量设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭露LLM-as-judge评估系统中存在的严重问题：尽管单个法官模型评分保持内部一致性，但不同法官模型间缺乏共识，这种系统性分歧挑战了现有评估方法的有效性。

Method: 通过3,240次评估（9个法官×120个独特视频×包装项目×3次独立运行）进行实证分析，使用Krippendorff's α测量评分者间一致性，构建分类器识别不同法官的评估模式，并从多个维度（严厉度、维度侧重、内部稳定性、证据行为）表征评估倾向。

Result: 评分者间一致性接近零（α=0.042），部分维度甚至低于随机噪声预期（α<0）。然而分类器仅凭评分就能以77.1%准确率识别具体法官，加入倾向特征后升至89.9%。同一模型家族的法官（GPT-4.1和GPT-5.2）可达到99.6%的区分精度。每个法官都展现出稳定且可识别的评估倾向。

Conclusion: LLM法官不是测量共同结构的可互换工具，而是各自编码独特质量理论的测量设备。平均多个法官的得分会产生不反映任何法官实际价值观的综合评判，这对基于LLM评估的方法论提出了根本性挑战。

Abstract: LLM-as-judge systems promise scalable, consistent evaluation. We find the opposite: judges are consistent, but not with each other; they are consistent with themselves. Across 3,240 evaluations (9 judges x 120 unique video x pack items x 3 independent runs), inter-judge agreement is near-zero (Krippendorff's α = 0.042). On two dimensions, judges disagree more than random noise would predict (α < 0). Yet this disagreement isn't chaos; it's structured. A classifier identifies which judge produced an evaluation with 77.1% accuracy from rubric scores alone, rising to 89.9% with disposition features. Within model families, the signal is even stronger: GPT-4.1 and GPT-5.2 are distinguishable with 99.6% accuracy. We call this the reliability paradox: judges cannot agree on what constitutes quality, yet their disagreement patterns are so stable they function as fingerprints. Each judge implements a distinct, stable theory of quality: an "evaluative disposition" that shapes how it interprets any rubric. We characterize these dispositions along multiple axes: harshness/leniency, dimension emphasis, within-judge stability (ICC), and evidence behavior (receipt validity, semantic linkage via NLI, and shotgun index). The implication is stark: LLM judges are not interchangeable instruments measuring a shared construct. They are distinct measurement devices, each encoding its own implicit theory of quality. Averaging their scores produces a synthetic verdict that corresponds to no judge's actual values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数字水印方法在处理推理大语言模型时面临两个主要问题：基于标记的水印技术会破坏推理流程的逻辑连贯性，而语义感知方法虽然提高了质量但引入了显著延迟或需要辅助模型。需要一种专门为推理密集型LLMs设计的水印框架，在不影响逻辑完整性的前提下实现高效水印。

Method: 1. 将生成过程解耦为无扰动的思考阶段和加水印的回答阶段；2. 提出关键性分数识别推理轨迹中的语义关键标记；3. 将这些标记蒸馏为主语义向量；4. PSV指导语义自适应机制，基于标记-PSV对齐度调整水印强度，确保鲁棒性而不损害逻辑完整性。

Result: 实验表明ReasonMark在多个指标上超越现有方法：文本困惑度降低0.35，翻译BLEU分数提高0.164，数学准确性提高0.67分。同时水印检测AUC提高0.34%，对抗攻击的鲁棒性更强，延迟增加可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 该工作实现了推理大语言模型在实际应用中的可追溯和可信部署，通过创新的解耦架构和语义自适应水印机制，解决了现有方法在逻辑连贯性、计算成本和检测性能之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) excelling in complex tasks present unique challenges for digital watermarking, as existing methods often disrupt logical coherence or incur high computational costs. Token-based watermarking techniques can corrupt the reasoning flow by applying pseudo-random biases, while semantic-aware approaches improve quality but introduce significant latency or require auxiliary models. This paper introduces ReasonMark, a novel watermarking framework specifically designed for reasoning-intensive LLMs. Our approach decouples generation into an undisturbed Thinking Phase and a watermarked Answering Phase. We propose a Criticality Score to identify semantically pivotal tokens from the reasoning trace, which are distilled into a Principal Semantic Vector (PSV). The PSV then guides a semantically-adaptive mechanism that modulates watermark strength based on token-PSV alignment, ensuring robustness without compromising logical integrity. Extensive experiments show ReasonMark surpasses state-of-the-art methods by reducing text Perplexity by 0.35, increasing translation BLEU score by 0.164, and raising mathematical accuracy by 0.67 points. These advancements are achieved alongside a 0.34% higher watermark detection AUC and stronger robustness to attacks, all with a negligible increase in latency. This work enables the traceable and trustworthy deployment of reasoning LLMs in real-world applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to growing interest in using synthetic data to train future models. However, this creates a self-consuming retraining loop, where models are trained on their own outputs and may cause performance drops and induce emerging biases. In real-world applications, previously deployed LLMs may influence the data they generate, leading to a dynamic system driven by user feedback. For example, if a model continues to underserve users from a group, less query data will be collected from this particular demographic of users. In this study, we introduce the concept of \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{C}onsuming \textbf{P}erformative \textbf{L}oop (\textbf{SCPL}) and investigate the role of synthetic data in shaping bias during these dynamic iterative training processes under controlled performative feedback. This controlled setting is motivated by the inaccessibility of real-world user preference data from dynamic production systems, and enables us to isolate and analyze feedback-driven bias evolution in a principled manner. We focus on two types of loops, including the typical retraining setting and the incremental fine-tuning setting, which is largely underexplored. Through experiments on three real-world tasks, we find that the performative loop increases preference bias and decreases disparate bias. We design a reward-based rejection sampling strategy to mitigate the bias, moving towards more trustworthy self-improving systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized text-based code automation, but their potential in graph-oriented engineering workflows remains under-explored. We introduce SimuAgent, an LLM-powered modeling and simulation agent tailored for Simulink. SimuAgent replaces verbose XML with a concise, dictionary-style Python representation, dramatically cutting token counts, improving interpretability, and enabling fast, in-process simulation. A lightweight plan-execute architecture, trained in two stages, equips the agent with both low-level tool skills and high-level design reasoning. To tackle sparse rewards in long-horizon tasks, we propose Reflection-GRPO (ReGRPO), which augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with self-reflection traces that supply rich intermediate feedback, accelerating convergence and boosting robustness. Experiments on SimuBench, our newly released benchmark comprising 5300 multi-domain modeling tasks, show that a Qwen2.5-7B model fine-tuned with SimuAgent converges faster and achieves higher modeling accuracy than standard RL baselines, and even surpasses GPT-4o when evaluated with few-shot prompting on the same benchmark. Ablations confirm that the two-stage curriculum and abstract-reconstruct data augmentation further enhance generalization. SimuAgent trains and runs entirely on-premise with modest hardware, delivering a privacy-preserving, cost-effective solution for industrial model-driven engineering. SimuAgent bridges the gap between LLMs and graphical modeling environments, offering a practical solution for AI-assisted engineering design in industrial settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in tool calling and tool usage, but suffer from hallucinations where they choose incorrect tools, provide malformed parameters and exhibit 'tool bypass' behavior by performing simulations and generating outputs instead of invoking specialized tools or external systems. This undermines the reliability of LLM based agents in production systems as it leads to inconsistent results, and bypasses security and audit controls. Such hallucinations in agent tool selection require early detection and error handling. Unlike existing hallucination detection methods that require multiple forward passes or external validation, we present a computationally efficient framework that detects tool-calling hallucinations in real-time by leveraging LLMs' internal representations during the same forward pass used for generation. We evaluate this approach on reasoning tasks across multiple domains, demonstrating strong detection performance (up to 86.4\% accuracy) while maintaining real-time inference capabilities with minimal computational overhead, particularly excelling at detecting parameter-level hallucinations and inappropriate tool selections, critical for reliable agent deployment.

Abstract: Agents capable of reasoning and planning in the real world require the ability of predicting the consequences of their actions. While world models possess this capability, they most often require action labels, that can be complex to obtain at scale. This motivates the learning of latent action models, that can learn an action space from videos alone. Our work addresses the problem of learning latent actions world models on in-the-wild videos, expanding the scope of existing works that focus on simple robotics simulations, video games, or manipulation data. While this allows us to capture richer actions, it also introduces challenges stemming from the video diversity, such as environmental noise, or the lack of a common embodiment across videos. To address some of the challenges, we discuss properties that actions should follow as well as relevant architectural choices and evaluations. We find that continuous, but constrained, latent actions are able to capture the complexity of actions from in-the-wild videos, something that the common vector quantization does not. We for example find that changes in the environment coming from agents, such as humans entering the room, can be transferred across videos. This highlights the capability of learning actions that are specific to in-the-wild videos. In the absence of a common embodiment across videos, we are mainly able to learn latent actions that become localized in space, relative to the camera. Nonetheless, we are able to train a controller that maps known actions to latent ones, allowing us to use latent actions as a universal interface and solve planning tasks with our world model with similar performance as action-conditioned baselines. Our analyses and experiments provide a step towards scaling latent action models to the real world.
