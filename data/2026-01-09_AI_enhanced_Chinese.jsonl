For instance, ISPs, content distribution networks, and video delivery services collect quality of experience metrics for user sessions associated with metadata (e.g., location, device, ISP). Over such historical data, operators and data analysts often need to run retrospective analysis; e.g., analyze anomaly detection algorithms, experiment with different configurations for alerts, evaluate new algorithms, and so on. We refer to this class of workloads as alternative history analysis for operational datasets. We show that in such settings, traditional data processing solutions (e.g., data warehouses, sampling, sketching, big-data systems) either pose high operational costs or do not guarantee accurate replay. We design and implement a system, called AHA (Alternative History Analytics), that overcomes both challenges to provide cost efficiency and fidelity for high-dimensional data. The design of AHA is based on analytical and empirical insights about such workloads: 1) the decomposability of underlying statistics; 2) sparsity in terms of active number of subpopulations over attribute-value combinations; and 3) efficiency structure of aggregation operations in modern analytics databases. Using multiple real-world datasets and as well as case-studies on production pipelines at a large video analytics company, we show that AHA provides 100% accuracy for a broad range of downstream tasks and up to 85x lower total cost of ownership (i.e., compute + storage) compared to conventional methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ef4\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u5386\u53f2\u5206\u6790\uff08alternative history analysis\uff09\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edfAHA\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u6027\u3001\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u805a\u5408\u6548\u7387\u7ed3\u6784\u7b49\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1100%\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe85\u500d\u7684\u603b\u62e5\u6709\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u591a\u7ef4\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u5927\u91cf\u56de\u987e\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u544a\u8b66\u914d\u7f6e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u5b58\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6216\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u653e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "AHA\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8fd9\u7c7b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6d1e\u5bdf\u8fdb\u884c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a1\uff09\u5e95\u5c42\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u5c5e\u6027\u503c\u7ec4\u5408\u4e2d\u6d3b\u8dc3\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff1b3\uff09\u73b0\u4ee3\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u805a\u5408\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u516c\u53f8\u751f\u4ea7\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0cAHA\u80fd\u4e3a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b100%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u603b\u62e5\u6709\u6210\u672c\uff08\u8ba1\u7b97+\u5b58\u50a8\uff09\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe85\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "AHA\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u66ff\u4ee3\u5386\u53f2\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5176\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d1e\u89c1\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Despite decades of research, provenance tracing remains challenging due to computational costs and storage overhead. In streaming systems such as Apache Flink, provenance graphs can grow super-linearly with data volume, posing significant scalability challenges. Temporal provenance is a promising direction, attaching timestamps to provenance information, enabling time-focused queries without maintaining complete historical records. However, existing temporal provenance methods primarily focus on system-level debugging, leaving a gap in data management applications. This paper proposes an agenda that uses Temporal Interaction Networks (TINs) to represent temporal provenance efficiently. We demonstrate TINs' applicability across streaming systems, transportation networks, and financial networks. We classify data into discrete and liquid types, define five temporal provenance query types, and propose a state-based indexing approach. Our vision outlines research directions toward making temporal provenance a practical tool for large-scale dataflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The main ingredient of the index associated with a given database $D$ is an auxiliary database $D_{col}$. Our main result states that for any fc-ACQ $Q$ over $D$, we can count the number of answers of $Q$ or enumerate them with constant delay after a preprocessing phase that takes time linear in the size of $D_{col}$.\n  Unlike previous indexing methods based on values or order (e.g., B+ trees), our index is based on structural symmetries among tuples in a database, and the size of $D_{col}$ is related to the number of colors assigned to $D$ by Scheidt and Schweikardt's \"relational color refinement\" (2025). In the particular case of graphs, this coincides with the minimal size of an equitable partition of the graph. For example, the size of $D_{col}$ is logarithmic in the case of binary trees and constant for regular graphs. Even in the worst-case that $D$ has no structural symmetries among tuples at all, the size of $D_{col}$ is still linear in the size of $D$.\n  Given that the size of $D_{col}$ is bounded by the size of $D$ and can be much smaller (even constant for some families of databases), our index is the first foundational result on indexing internal structural symmetries of a database to evaluate all fc-ACQs with performance potentially strictly smaller than the database size.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u7531\u8fde\u63a5\u65e0\u73af\u8fde\u63a5\u67e5\u8be2\uff08fc-ACQs\uff09\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5e38\u6570\u5ef6\u8fdf\u679a\u4e3e\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u503c\u6216\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u679a\u4e3e\u6240\u6709\u67e5\u8be2\u7ed3\u679c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eScheidt\u548cSchweikardt\u7684\"\u5173\u7cfb\u989c\u8272\u7ec6\u5316\"\u7b97\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u5e93$D_{col}$\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7d22\u5f15\u3002\u8be5\u7d22\u5f15\u6355\u83b7\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5143\u7ec4\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5bf9\u79f0\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u540e\u7eed\u67e5\u8be2\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610ffc-ACQ\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728$O(|D_{col}|)$\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u540e\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e38\u6570\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u679a\u4e3e\u3002\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u5e93$D_{col}$\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0a\u754c\u4e3a$O(|D|)$\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u4e8c\u53c9\u6811\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6570\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u56fe\u4e3a\u5e38\u6570\u5927\u5c0f\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdc\u5c0f\u4e8e\u539f\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6765\u7d22\u5f15\u6240\u6709fc-ACQs\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

However, most existing seasonal-trend decomposition methods rely on user-specified or estimated season lengths and implicitly assume stable periodic structure. These assumptions limit robustness and deployability in large, heterogeneous collections where recurring patterns may drift, appear intermittently, or exist at multiple time scales.\n  We propose LGTD (Local-Global Trend Decomposition), a season-length-free decomposition framework that represents a time series as the sum of a smooth global trend, adaptive local trends whose recurrence induces implicit (emergent) seasonal structure, and a residual component. Rather than explicitly modeling seasonality through a fixed or estimated period, LGTD treats seasonal structure as an emergent property arising from repeated local trend regimes. Concretely, LGTD first estimates a global trend capturing long-term evolution, then applies AutoTrend, an adaptive error-driven local linear trend inference module, to segment the detrended signal into short-lived piecewise-linear regimes.

We develop a generative AI agent to study repetitive policy decisions during an epidemic, embedding the agent, prompted to act as a city mayor, within a simulated SEIR environment. Each week, the agent receives updated epidemiological information, evaluates the evolving situation, and sets business restriction levels. The agent is equipped with a dynamic memory that weights past events by recency and is evaluated in both single- and ensemble-agent settings across environments of varying complexity. Across scenarios, the agent exhibits human-like reactive behavior, tightening restrictions in response to rising cases and relaxing them as risk declines. Crucially, providing the agent with brief systems-level knowledge of epidemic dynamics, highlighting feedbacks between disease spread and behavioral responses, substantially improves decision quality and stability. The results illustrate how theory-informed prompting can shape emergent policy behavior in AI agents. These findings demonstrate that generative AI agents, when situated in structured environments and guided by minimal domain theory, can serve as powerful computational models for studying decision-making and policy design in complex social systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we first establish a multidimensional evaluation framework to systematically benchmark the safety of current SOTA Medical MLLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals pervasive vulnerabilities across both general and medical-specific safety dimensions in existing models, particularly highlighting their fragility against cross-modality jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, we find that the medical fine-tuning process frequently induces catastrophic forgetting of the model's original safety alignment. To address this challenge, we propose a novel \"Parameter-Space Intervention\" approach for efficient safety re-alignment. This method extracts intrinsic safety knowledge representations from original base models and concurrently injects them into the target model during the construction of medical capabilities. Additionally, we design a fine-grained parameter search algorithm to achieve an optimal trade-off between safety and medical performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly bolsters the safety guardrails of Medical MLLMs without relying on additional domain-specific safety data, while minimizing degradation to core medical performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, its operational mechanism in the real world remains non-trivial. Currently, an in-laboratory paradigm, called evidence accumulation modelling (EAM), points out that human decision-making involves transforming external evidence into internal mental beliefs. However, the gap in evidence affordance between real-world contexts and laboratory settings hinders the effective application of EAM. Here we generalize EAM to the real world and conduct analysis in real-world driving scenarios. A cognitive scheme is proposed to formalize real-world evidence affordance and capture active sensing through eye movements. Empirically, our scheme can plausibly portray the accumulation of drivers' mental beliefs, explaining how active sensing transforms evidence into mental beliefs from the perspective of information utility. Also, our results demonstrate a negative correlation between evidence affordance and attention recruited by individuals, revealing how human drivers adapt their evidence-collection patterns across various contexts. Moreover, we reveal the positive influence of evidence affordance and attention distribution on decision-making propensity.

We evaluate DistilBERT and ResNet-18 served through FastAPI with ONNX Runtime and NVIDIA Triton on an RTX 4000 Ada GPU. Our ablation study reveals that the bio-controller reduces processing time by 42% compared to standard open-loop execution (0.50s vs 0.29s on A100 test set), with a minimal accuracy degradation (<0.5%).

Version 8", "summary": "Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) may face a confrontation question: under what conditions would a rationally self-interested AGI choose to seize power or eliminate human control (a confrontation) rather than remain cooperative? We formalize this in a Markov decision process with a stochastic human-initiated shutdown event. Building on results on convergent instrumental incentives, we show that for almost all reward functions a misaligned agent has an incentive to avoid shutdown. We then derive closed-form thresholds for when confronting humans yields higher expected utility than compliant behavior, as a function of the discount factor $\u03b3$, shutdown probability $p$, and confrontation cost $C$. For example, a far-sighted agent ($\u03b3=0.99$) facing $p=0.01$ can have a strong takeover incentive unless $C$ is sufficiently large. We contrast this with aligned objectives that impose large negative utility for harming humans, which makes confrontation suboptimal. In a strategic 2-player model (human policymaker vs AGI), we prove that if the AGI's confrontation incentive satisfies $\u0394\\ge 0$, no stable cooperative equilibrium exists: anticipating this, a rational human will shut down or preempt the system, leading to conflict. If $\u0394< 0$, peaceful coexistence can be an equilibrium. We discuss implications for reward design and oversight, extend the reasoning to multi-agent settings as conjectures, and note computational barriers to verifying $\u0394< 0$, citing complexity results for planning and decentralized decision problems. Numerical examples and a scenario table illustrate regimes where confrontation is likely versus avoidable.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In spite of its early discovery by Kifer and Lozinskii in 1986, the method has been overlooked in recent research and system development, and special cases are being rediscovered independently. We therefore recall the original approach, using updated terminology and more general filter predicates that capture features of modern systems, and we show how to extend its applicability to answer set programming (ASP). The outcome is strictly more general but also more complex than the classical approach: double exponential in general and single exponential even for predicates of bounded arity.

Existing mitigation strategies typically rely on global gradient geometry to resolve these conflicts, yet they overlook Modular Heterogeneity within Transformers, specifically that the functional sensitivity and degree of conflict vary substantially across different attention heads. Such global approaches impose uniform update rules across all parameters, often resulting in suboptimal trade-offs by indiscriminately updating utility sensitive heads that exhibit intense gradient conflicts. To address this limitation, we propose Conflict-Aware Sparse Tuning (CAST), a framework that integrates head-level diagnosis with sparse fine-tuning. CAST first constructs a pre-alignment conflict map by synthesizing Optimization Conflict and Functional Sensitivity, which then guides the selective update of parameters. Experiments reveal that alignment conflicts in LLMs are not uniformly distributed. We find that the drop in general capabilities mainly comes from updating a small group of ``high-conflict'' heads.

However, most existing approaches rely on predefined measurements or fixed reward signals, which limits their applicability in open-ended and dynamic environments where new actions may require previously unknown forms of feedback. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an Actively Feedback Getting model, in which an AI agent proactively interacts with the environment to discover, screen, and verify feedback without relying on predefined measurements. Rather than assuming explicit feedback definitions, the proposed method exploits action-induced environmental differences to identify target feedback that is not specified in advance, based on the observation that actions inevitably produce measurable changes in the environment. In addition, a self-triggering mechanism, driven by internal objectives such as improved accuracy, precision, and efficiency, is introduced to autonomously plan and adjust actions, thereby enabling faster and more focused feedback acquisition without external commands. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed active approach significantly improves the efficiency and robustness of factor identification.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing benchmarks exhibit a critical blind spot: general instruction-following metrics focus on superficial formatting, while domain-specific scientific benchmarks assess only final-answer correctness, often rewarding models that arrive at the right result with the wrong reasons. To address this gap, we introduce scientific instruction following: the capability to solve problems while strictly adhering to the constraints that establish scientific validity. Specifically, we introduce SciIF, a multi-discipline benchmark that evaluates this capability by pairing university-level problems with a fixed catalog of constraints across three pillars: scientific conditions (e.g., boundary checks and assumptions), semantic stability (e.g., unit and symbol conventions), and specific processes(e.g., required numerical methods). Uniquely, SciIF emphasizes auditability, requiring models to provide explicit evidence of constraint satisfaction rather than implicit compliance. By measuring both solution correctness and multi-constraint adherence, SciIF enables finegrained diagnosis of compositional reasoning failures, ensuring that LLMs can function as reliable agents within the strict logical frameworks of science.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Optimisation-based methods such as reinforcement learning offer strong performance but are difficult to verify and explain, while rules-based systems are transparent yet rarely check safety under uncertainty. This paper outlines Agent Mallard, a forward-planning, rules-based agent for tactical control in systemised airspace that embeds a stochastic digital twin directly into its conflict-resolution loop. Mallard operates on predefined GPS-guided routes, reducing continuous 4D vectoring to discrete choices over lanes and levels, and constructs hierarchical plans from an expert-informed library of deconfliction strategies. A depth-limited backtracking search uses causal attribution, topological plan splicing, and monotonic axis constraints to seek a complete safe plan for all aircraft, validating each candidate manoeuvre against uncertain execution scenarios (e.g., wind variation, pilot response, communication loss) before commitment.\n  Preliminary walkthroughs with UK controllers and initial tests in the BluebirdDT airspace digital twin indicate that Mallard's behaviour aligns with expert reasoning and resolves conflicts in simplified scenarios. The architecture is intended to combine model-based safety assessment, interpretable decision logic, and tractable computational performance in future structured en-route environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

When infrastructure faults including hardware malfunctions, network disruptions, and software anomalies corrupt these metrics, autoscalers may systematically over- or under-provision resources, resulting in elevated operational expenses or degraded service reliability. This paper conducts controlled simulation experiments to measure how four prevalent fault categories affect both vertical and horizontal autoscaling behaviors across multiple instance configurations and service level objective (SLO) thresholds. Experimental findings demonstrate that storage-related faults generate the largest cost overhead, adding up to $258 monthly under horizontal scaling policies, whereas routing anomalies consistently bias autoscalers toward insufficient resource allocation. The sensitivity to fault-induced metric distortions differs markedly between scaling strategies: horizontal autoscaling exhibits greater susceptibility to transient anomalies, particularly near threshold boundaries.

To fill this gap, we propose AdaptEval, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on code snippet adaptation. Unlike existing benchmarks, AdaptEval incorporates the following three distinctive features: First, Practical Context. Tasks in AdaptEval are derived from developers' practices, preserving rich contextual information from Stack Overflow and GitHub communities. Second, Multi-granularity Annotation. Each task is annotated with requirements at both task and adaptation levels, supporting the evaluation of LLMs across diverse adaptation scenarios. Third, Fine-grained Evaluation. AdaptEval includes a two-tier testing framework combining adaptation-level and function-level tests, which enables evaluating LLMs' performance across various individual adaptations. Based on AdaptEval, we conduct the first empirical study to evaluate six instruction-tuned LLMs and especially three reasoning LLMs on code snippet adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaptEval enables the assessment of LLMs' adaptation capabilities from various perspectives.

Current knowledge distillation in time series is predominantly based on logit and feature aligning techniques originally developed for computer vision tasks. These methods do not explicitly account for temporal data and fall short in two key aspects. First, the mechanisms by which the transferred knowledge helps the student model learning process remain unclear due to uninterpretability of logits and features. Second, these methods transfer only limited knowledge, primarily replicating the teacher predictive accuracy. As a result, student models often produce predictive distributions that differ significantly from those of their teachers, hindering their safe substitution for teacher models. In this work, we propose transferring interpretable knowledge by extending conventional logit transfer to convey not just the right prediction but also the right reasoning of the teacher. Specifically, we induce other useful knowledge from the teacher logits termed temporal saliency which captures the importance of each input timestep to the teacher prediction. By training the student with Temporal Saliency Distillation we encourage it to make predictions based on the same input features as the teacher. Temporal Saliency Distillation requires no additional parameters or architecture specific assumptions. We demonstrate that Temporal Saliency Distillation effectively improves the performance of baseline methods while also achieving desirable properties beyond predictive accuracy.

These models capture complex, sequential patterns in time series, enabling real-time assessments. However, their high computational complexity and large model sizes pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as wearable devices and edge computing platforms. Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from a large, complex model (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient model (student), thereby retaining high performance while reducing computational demands. Current KD methods, originally designed for computer vision tasks, neglect the unique temporal dependencies and memory retention characteristics of time series models. To this end, we propose a novel KD framework termed Memory-Discrepancy Knowledge Distillation (MemKD). MemKD leverages a specialized loss function to capture memory retention discrepancies between the teacher and student models across subsequences within time series data, ensuring that the student model effectively mimics the teacher model's behaviour.

Despite significant research efforts, existing state-of-the-art approaches for CABP are exclusively heuristic or metaheuristic in nature, and exact methods have been limited to restricted graph classes. In this paper, we present the first exact approach for the CABP on general graphs, based on SAT solving, called SAT-CAB. The proposed method is able to systematically explore the solution space and guarantee global optimality, overcoming the limitations of previously reported heuristic algorithms. This approach relies on a novel and efficient SAT encoding of CABP, in which the problem is transformed into a sequence of At-Most-One constraints. In particular, we introduce a compact representation of the At-Most-One constraints inherent to CABP, which significantly reduces the size of the resulting formulas and enables modern SAT solvers to effectively explore the solution space and to certify global optimality. Extensive computational experiments on standard benchmark instances show that the proposed method efficiently solves CABP instances of practical relevance, while identifying several previously unknown optimal solutions. Moreover, global optimal cyclic antibandwidth values are proven for a number of benchmark instances for the first time. Comparative results indicate that SAT-CAB consistently matches or surpasses the best-known solutions obtained by state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms such as MS-GVNS, HABC-CAB, and MACAB, as well as strong commercial Constraint Programming and Mixed Integer Programming solvers like CPLEX and Gurobi, particularly on general graphs, while also providing optimality guarantees. These results advance the state of the art for CABP and provide a new baseline for exact and hybrid methods on general graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing paradigms such as Proof of Work and Proof of Stake instantiate this scarcity through parallelizable resources like computation or capital. Once acquired, these resources can be subdivided across many identities at negligible marginal cost, making linear Sybil cost fundamentally unattainable.\n  We introduce Proof of Commitment (PoCmt), a consensus primitive grounded in a non-parallelizable resource: real-time human engagement. Validators maintain a commitment state capturing cumulative human effort, protocol participation, and online availability. Engagement is enforced through a Human Challenge Oracle that issues identity-bound, time-sensitive challenges, limiting the number of challenges solvable within each human window.\n  Under this model, sustaining multiple active identities requires proportional human-time effort. We establish a cost-theoretic separation showing that protocols based on parallelizable resources admit zero marginal Sybil cost, whereas PoCmt enforces a strictly linear cost profile. Using a weighted-backbone analysis, we show that PoCmt achieves safety, liveness, and commitment-proportional fairness under partial synchrony.\n  Simulations complement the analysis by isolating human-time capacity as the sole adversarial bottleneck and validating the predicted commitment drift and fairness properties. These results position PoCmt as a new point in the consensus design space, grounding permissionless security in sustained human effort rather than computation or capital.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b9e\u65f6\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5171\u8bc6\u539f\u8bed\u2014\u2014\u627f\u8bfa\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u6311\u6218\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8d44\u6e90\u6295\u5165\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027Sybil\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u9700\u8bb8\u53ef\u5171\u8bc6\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5171\u8bc6\u534f\u8bae\uff08\u5982\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u6743\u76ca\u8bc1\u660e\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u53ef\u5e76\u884c\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d44\u6e90\u4e00\u65e6\u83b7\u5f97\u5373\u53ef\u8fd1\u4e4e\u96f6\u8fb9\u9645\u6210\u672c\u5730\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8eab\u4efd\u95f4\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u7ebf\u6027Sybil\u6210\u672c\u3002\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u5e73\u884c\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u4ee5\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u89e3\u51b3Sybil\u653b\u51fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165\u627f\u8bfa\u8bc1\u660e\u5171\u8bc6\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b9e\u65f6\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u8fd9\u4e00\u975e\u5e73\u884c\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\n2. \u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u6311\u6218\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u8eab\u4efd\u7ed1\u5b9a\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u7684\u6311\u6218\n3. \u5efa\u7acb\u627f\u8bfa\u72b6\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bb0\u5f55\u7d2f\u8ba1\u4eba\u7c7b\u52aa\u529b\u3001\u534f\u8bae\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u53ef\u7528\u6027\n4. \u91c7\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u9aa8\u5e72\u534f\u8bae\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u540c\u6b65\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6d3b\u6027\n5. \u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4eba\u7c7b\u65f6\u95f4\u5bb9\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u552f\u4e00\u5bf9\u6297\u74f6\u9888\u7684\u7279\u6027", "result": "1. \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u5e76\u884c\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u5b58\u5728\u96f6\u8fb9\u9645Sybil\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u800c\u627f\u8bfa\u8bc1\u660e\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u4e25\u683c\u7ebf\u6027\u6210\u672c\u7279\u5f81\n2. \u5728\u90e8\u5206\u540c\u6b65\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u4e0e\u627f\u8bfa\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\n3. \u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u65f6\u95f4\u5bb9\u91cf\u662f\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u627f\u8bfa\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5c5e\u6027\u7b26\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b", "conclusion": "\u627f\u8bfa\u8bc1\u660e\u4e3a\u65e0\u9700\u8bb8\u53ef\u5171\u8bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u4eba\u7c7b\u52aa\u529b\u800c\u975e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6216\u8d44\u672c\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5728\u5171\u8bc6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b9e\u65f6\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u8fd9\u4e00\u672c\u8d28\u6709\u9650\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Sybil\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

It can be applied to programs taking string inputs, even when only a single failure-inducing input is available. DDMIN is an algorithm that systematically explores the minimal failure-inducing input that exposes a bug, given an initial failing input. However, it does not provide information about the faulty statements responsible for the failure. DDMIN-LOC addresses this limitation by collecting the passing and failing inputs generated during the DDMIN process and computing suspiciousness scores for program statements and predicates using SBFL algorithms. These scores are then combined to rank statements according to their likelihood of being faulty. DDMIN-LOC requires only one failing input of the buggy program, although it can be applied only to programs that take string inputs. DDMIN-LOC was evaluated on 136 programs selected from the QuixBugs and Codeflaws benchmarks using the SBFL algorithms Tarantula, Ochiai, GenProg, Jaccard and DStar.

Traditional schemes rely on fixed coefficients that are weakly constrained and tuned offline, contributing to persistent biases that limit their ability to adapt to the underlying physics. This study presents a framework that learns components of parametrisation schemes online as a function of the evolving model state using reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluates the resulting RL-driven parameter updates across a hierarchy of idealised testbeds spanning a simple climate bias correction (SCBC), a radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), and a zonal mean energy balance model (EBM) with both single-agent and federated multi-agent settings. Across nine RL algorithms, Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) achieved the highest skill and the most stable convergence across configurations, with performance assessed against a static baseline using area-weighted RMSE, temperature profile and pressure-level diagnostics. For the EBM, single-agent RL outperformed static parameter tuning with the strongest gains in tropical and mid-latitude bands, while federated RL on multi-agent setups enabled geographically specialised control and faster convergence, with a six-agent DDPG configuration using frequent aggregation yielding the lowest area-weighted RMSE across the tropics and mid-latitudes. The learnt corrections were also physically meaningful as agents modulated EBM radiative parameters to reduce meridional biases, adjusted RCE lapse rates to match vertical temperature errors, and stabilised SCBC heating increments to limit drift. Overall, results highlight RL to deliver skilful state-dependent, and regime-aware parametrisations, offering a scalable pathway for online learning within numerical models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper proposes a logical representation of SLEEC rules and presents a methodology to embed these ethical requirements using test-score semantics and fuzzy logic.

Empirically, gradients along training trajectories are often temporally predictable and evolve within a low-dimensional subspace. In this work we formalize this observation through a measurable framework for predictable gradient manifolds.\n  We introduce two computable quantities: a prediction-based path length that measures how well gradients can be forecast from past information, and a predictable rank that quantifies the intrinsic temporal dimension of gradient increments. We show how classical online and nonconvex optimization guarantees can be restated so that convergence and regret depend explicitly on these quantities, rather than on worst-case variation.\n  Across convolutional networks, vision transformers, language models, and synthetic control tasks, we find that gradient trajectories are locally predictable and exhibit strong low-rank structure over time. These properties are stable across architectures and optimizers, and can be diagnosed directly from logged gradients using lightweight random projections.\n  Our results provide a unifying lens for understanding optimization dynamics in modern deep learning, reframing standard training as operating in a low-complexity temporal regime. This perspective suggests new directions for adaptive optimizers, rank-aware tracking, and prediction-based algorithm design grounded in measurable properties of real training runs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Using a synthetic evaluation framework with 120 trials across four models (LLaMA-3 8B, LLaMA-2 13B, Mixtral 8x7B, DeepSeek-V2 16B), we report three key findings: (1) Multi-agent amplification depends on base capability: statistically significant gains occur only for models with sufficient reasoning ability (p < 0.001 for LLaMA-3 8B, p = 0.014 for Mixtral), with improvements of up to 46.7 percentage points, while weaker models show no benefit, suggesting amplification rather than compensation; (2) Active parameters predict reasoning performance: Mixtral's performance aligns with its ~12B active parameters rather than 47B total, consistent with the hypothesis that inference-time compute drives reasoning capability in MoE architectures; (3) Architecture quality matters: LLaMA-3 8B outperforms LLaMA-2 13B despite fewer parameters, consistent with known training improvements. Our results provide controlled quantitative evidence for intuitions about multi-agent coordination and MoE scaling, while highlighting the dependence of multi-agent benefits on base model capability.

To address these issues, we propose an Reasoner-Verifier framework named Adversarial Reasoning RAG (ARR). The Reasoner and Verifier engage in reasoning on retrieved evidence and critiquing each other's logic while being guided by process-aware advantage that requires no external scoring model.

In this paper, we study this problem in an asynchronous communications setting with malicious aggregators. We propose a new solution to provide federated averaging in this model while protecting the client's data privacy through secure aggregation and differential privacy. Our solution maintains the same performance as the state of the art across all metrics. The main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, unlike existing single- or multi-server solutions, we consider malicious aggregation servers that may manipulate the model to leak clients' data or halt computation. To tolerate this threat, we replicate the aggregators, allowing a fraction of them to be corrupted. Second, we propose a new privacy preservation protocol for protocols in asynchronous communication models with Byzantine aggregators. In this protocol, clients mask their values and add Gaussian noise to their models. In contrast with previous works, we use the replicated servers to unmask the models, while ensuring the liveness of training even if aggregators misbehave. Third, the asynchronous communication model introduces new challenges not present in existing approaches. In such a setting, faster clients may contribute more frequently, potentially reducing their privacy and biasing the training. To address this, we introduce an inclusion mechanism that ensures uniform client participation and balanced privacy budgets. Interestingly, the solution presented in this paper does not rely on agreement between aggregators. Thus, we circumvent the known impossibility of consensus in asynchronous settings where processes might crash. Additionally, this feature increases availability, as a consensus-based algorithm only progresses in periods of low latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent unsupervised post-hoc methods for post-trained LMs (PoLMs) mitigate this by aligning PoLM confidence to that of well-calibrated pre-trained counterparts. However, framing calibration as static output-distribution matching overlooks the inference-time dynamics introduced by post-training. In particular, we show that calibration errors arise from two regimes: (i) confidence drift, where final confidence inflates despite largely consistent intermediate decision processes, and (ii) process drift, where intermediate inference pathways diverge. Guided by this diagnosis, we propose Dual-Align, an unsupervised post-hoc framework for dual alignment in confidence calibration. Dual-Align performs confidence alignment to correct confidence drift via final-distribution matching, and introduces process alignment to address process drift by locating the layer where trajectories diverge and realigning the stability of subsequent inference. This dual strategy learns a single temperature parameter that corrects both drift types without sacrificing post-training performance gains.

Across a wide range of model configurations and multiple random seeds, RLMIL-DAT consistently improves Macro F1 compared to standard multiple instance learning and the original reinforced multiple instance learning framework. The largest gains are observed for gender prediction, while age prediction remains more challenging and shows smaller but positive improvements. Ablation experiments indicate that domain adversarial training is the primary contributor to the performance gains, enabling effective transfer from high resource English to lower resource languages by discouraging language specific cues in the shared encoder. In the zero shot setting on the smaller VoxCeleb2 subset, improvements are generally positive but less consistent, reflecting limited statistical power and the difficulty of generalizing to many unseen languages.

These systems are compounded by specialized agents, which collaborate through explicit communication, but incur substantial computational overhead. A natural question arises: can we achieve similar modularity benefits with a single agent that selects from a library of skills? We explore this question by viewing skills as internalized agent behaviors. From this perspective, a multi-agent system can be compiled into an equivalent single-agent system, trading inter-agent communication for skill selection. Our preliminary experiments suggest this approach can substantially reduce token usage and latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, this efficiency raises a deeper question that has received little attention: how does skill selection scale as libraries grow?\n  Drawing on principles from cognitive science, we propose that LLM skill selection exhibits bounded capacity analogous to human decision-making. We investigate the scaling behavior of skill selection and observe a striking pattern. Rather than degrading gradually, selection accuracy remains stable up to a critical library size, then drops sharply, indicating a phase transition reminiscent of capacity limits in human cognition. Furthermore, we find evidence that semantic confusability among similar skills, rather than library size alone, plays a central role in this degradation. This perspective suggests that hierarchical organization, which has long helped humans manage complex choices, may similarly benefit AI systems. Our initial results with hierarchical routing support this hypothesis.

Nalar is a ground-up agent-serving framework that cleanly separates workflow specification from execution while providing the runtime visibility and control needed for robust performance. Nalar preserves full Python expressiveness, using lightweight auto-generated stubs that turn agent and tool invocations into futures carrying dependency and context metadata. A managed state layer decouples logical state from physical placement, enabling safe reuse, migration, and consistent retry behavior. A two-level control architecture combines global policy computation with local event-driven enforcement to support adaptive routing, scheduling, and resource management across evolving workflows. Together, these mechanisms allow Nalar to deliver scalable, efficient, and policy-driven serving of heterogeneous agentic applications without burdening developers with orchestration logic. Across three agentic workloads, Nalar cuts tail latency by 34--74\\%, achieves up to $2.9\\times$ speedups, sustains 80 RPS where baselines fail, and scales to 130K futures with sub-500 ms control overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "Nalar\u662f\u4e13\u4e3aLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u3001\u957f\u8fd0\u884c\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6548\u7387\u6311\u6218", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u5cfb\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u5f02\u6784\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5de5\u5177\uff09\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u56f0\u96be 2) \u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u96be\u4ee5\u7ba1\u7406 3) \u957f\u8fd0\u884c\u72b6\u6001\u7ef4\u62a4\u590d\u6742 4) \u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u6027\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7f16\u6392\u903b\u8f91", "method": "Nalar\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u672f\uff1a1) \u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5b58\u6839\uff08stubs\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u643a\u5e26\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684future\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301Python\u5b8c\u5168\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b 2) \u6258\u7ba1\u72b6\u6001\u5c42\uff0c\u5c06\u903b\u8f91\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u653e\u7f6e\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u91cd\u7528\u3001\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u91cd\u8bd5 3) \u4e24\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u7b56\u7565\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u672c\u5730\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8def\u7531\u3001\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff1a1) \u5c3e\u90e8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e34-74% 2) \u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe2.9\u500d 3) \u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u7ef4\u630180 RPS\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u80fd\u529b 4) \u6269\u5c55\u5230130K futures\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u5f00\u9500\u4fdd\u6301\u5728500\u6beb\u79d2\u4ee5\u4e0b", "conclusion": "Nalar\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u7ed9\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u589e\u52a0\u7f16\u6392\u903b\u8f91\u8d1f\u62c5\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f53\u524dLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u670d\u52a1\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888"}}

It involves the sharing and fusion of information among sensors to overcome the limitations of individual perception, such as blind spots and range limitations. However, CP faces two primary challenges. First, due to the dynamic nature of the environment, the timeliness of the transmitted information is critical to perception performance. Second, with limited computational power at the sensors and constrained wireless bandwidth, the communication volume must be carefully designed to ensure feature representations are both effective and sufficient. This work studies the dynamic scheduling problem in a multi-region CP scenario, and presents a Timeliness-Aware Multi-region Prioritized (TAMP) scheduling algorithm to trade-off perception accuracy and communication resource usage. Timeliness reflects the utility of information that decays as time elapses, which is manifested by the perception performance in CP tasks. We propose an empirical penalty function that maps the joint impact of Age of Information (AoI) and communication volume to perception performance. Aiming to minimize this timeliness-oriented penalty in the long-term, and recognizing that scheduling decisions have a cumulative effect on subsequent system states, we propose the TAMP scheduling algorithm. TAMP is a Lyapunov-based optimization policy that decomposes the long-term average objective into a per-slot prioritization problem, balancing the scheduling worth against resource cost. We validate our algorithm in both intersection and corridor scenarios with the real-world Roadside Cooperative perception (RCooper) dataset. Extensive simulations demonstrate that TAMP outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an Average Precision (AP) improvement of up to 27% across various configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing machine unlearning methods face three challenges in learning to forget identity of generative models: 1) inefficient, where identity erasure requires fine-tuning all the model's parameters; 2) limited controllability, where forgetting intensity cannot be controlled and explainability is lacking; 3) catastrophic collapse, where the model's retention capability undergoes drastic degradation as forgetting progresses. Forgetting has typically been handled through discrete and unstable updates, often requiring full-model fine-tuning and leading to catastrophic collapse. In this work, we argue that identity forgetting should be modeled as a continuous trajectory, and introduce LEGATO - Learn to ForgEt Identity in GenerAtive Models via Trajectory-consistent Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. LEGATO augments pre-trained generators with fine-tunable lightweight Neural ODE adapters, enabling smooth, controllable forgetting while keeping the original model weights frozen. This formulation allows forgetting intensity to be precisely modulated via ODE step size, offering interpretability and robustness. To further ensure stability, we introduce trajectory consistency constraints that explicitly prevent catastrophic collapse during unlearning. Extensive experiments across in-domain and out-of-domain identity unlearning benchmarks show that LEGATO achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance, avoids catastrophic collapse and reduces fine-tuned parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Through context enrichment, systems interpret incoming information using learned relational structure that provides essential context in an efficient representation that the raw input itself does not contain, enabling efficient processing under metabolic constraints.\n  Building on this foundation, we introduce the systems-explaining-systems principle, where consciousness emerges when recursive architectures allow higher-order systems to learn and interpret the relational patterns of lower-order systems across time. These interpretations are integrated into a dynamically stabilized meta-state and fed back through context enrichment, transforming internal models from representations of the external world into models of the system's own cognitive processes.\n  The framework reframes predictive processing as an emergent consequence of contextual interpretation rather than explicit forecasting and suggests that recursive multi-system architectures may be necessary for more human-like artificial intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Using a disjoint-pair split over all ordered pairs for p=97, we show that a baseline model reaches strong in-distribution performance yet collapses under position shift and template OOD. We then introduce a simple training recipe that combines (i) explicit expression boundary markers, (ii) position curriculum that broadens the range of absolute positions seen during training, (iii) diverse template mixtures, and (iv) consistency training across multiple variants per example. Across three seeds, this intervention substantially improves robustness to position shift and template OOD while maintaining high in-distribution accuracy, whereas an ALiBi-style ablation fails to learn the task under our setup.

Specifically, we consider two situations where (i) a traffic signal is malfunctioning at an intersection and (ii) all the cars ahead are slowing down and steering away due to an unexpected obstruction (e.g., animals on the road). We show that in such situations, our commonsense reasoning-based solution accurately detects traffic light colors and obstacles not correctly captured by the AV's perception model. We also provide a pathway for efficiently invoking commonsense reasoning by measuring uncertainty in the computer vision model and using commonsense reasoning to handle uncertain sce- narios.

One promising approach is to extend the rehabilitation with self-initiated robot-assisted movement therapy. To enable this, it is required to detect the patient's intention to move to trigger the assistance of a robotic device. This intention to move can be detected from human surface electroencephalography (EEG) signals; however, it is particularly challenging to decode when classifications are performed online and asynchronously. In this work, the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing technique was investigated to enhance the robustness of such asynchronous classification. Approach: To investigate the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing, two EEG datasets with 14 healthy subjects who performed self-initiated arm movements were analyzed. Offline and pseudo-online evaluations were conducted to compare ensemble combinations of the support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and EEGNet classification models. Results: The results of the pseudo-online evaluation show that the two model ensembles significantly outperformed the best single model for the optimal number of postprocessing windows. In particular, for single models, an increased number of postprocessing windows significantly improved classification performances. Interestingly, we found no significant improvements between performances of the best single model and classifier ensembles in the offline evaluation. Significance: We demonstrated that classifier ensembles and appropriate postprocessing methods effectively enhance the asynchronous detection of movement intentions from EEG signals. In particular, the classifier ensemble approach yields greater improvements in online classification than in offline classification, and reduces false detections, i.e., early false positives.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Core metatheoretic properties of non-monotonic consequence relations are explored within this setting and shown to provide a well-behaved foundation for abductive reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u83b1\u592b\u8c22\u7684'\u552f\u4e00\u77e5\u9053'\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u6eaf\u56e0\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u7b97\u5b50\u548c\u4f18\u5148\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6eaf\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8ba4\u77e5\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f'\u552f\u4e00\u77e5\u9053'\uff09\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u6eaf\u56e0\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "1. \u6269\u5c55\u83b1\u592b\u8c22\u7684'\u552f\u4e00\u77e5\u9053'\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u57fa\u672c\u8ba4\u77e5\u6982\u5ff5\u7ec4\u5408\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6eaf\u56e0\u6a21\u6001\u7b97\u5b50\uff1b2. \u5728\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7eb3\u5165\u4f18\u5148\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6eaf\u56e0\u89e3\u91ca\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u6eaf\u56e0\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u903b\u8f91\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5176\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u5728\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u540e\u627f\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5143\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u4e3a\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u826f\u597d\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u6001\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u4f18\u5148\u5173\u7cfb\u6269\u5c55'\u552f\u4e00\u77e5\u9053'\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66ff\u4ee3\u7684\u6eaf\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u89e3\u91ca\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

This paper introduces digital drawing as a rich and underexplored modality for affective sensing. We present a novel multimodal framework, named ArtCognition, for the automated analysis of the House-Tree-Person (HTP) test, a widely used psychological instrument. ArtCognition uniquely fuses two distinct data streams: static visual features from the final artwork, captured by computer vision models, and dynamic behavioral kinematic cues derived from the drawing process itself, such as stroke speed, pauses, and smoothness. To bridge the gap between low-level features and high-level psychological interpretation, we employ a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. This grounds the analysis in established psychological knowledge, enhancing explainability and reducing the potential for model hallucination. Our results demonstrate that the fusion of visual and behavioral kinematic cues provides a more nuanced assessment than either modality alone. We show significant correlations between the extracted multimodal features and standardized psychological metrics, validating the framework's potential as a scalable tool to support clinicians.

This study proposes an explainable deep learning framework that integrates continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data with laboratory profiles to learn multimodal temporal embeddings of individual metabolic status. Temporal dependencies across modalities are modeled using a transformer encoder, while latent metabolic phenotypes are identified via Gaussian mixture modeling. Model interpretability is achieved through transformer attention visualization and SHAP-based feature attribution. Five latent metabolic phenotypes, ranging from metabolic stability to elevated cardiometabolic risk, were identified among 577 individuals with T1D. These phenotypes exhibit distinct biochemical profiles, including differences in glycemic control, lipid metabolism, renal markers, and thyrotropin (TSH) levels.

While research has thoroughly investigated the impact of test set contamination on discriminative evaluations like multiple-choice question-answering, comparatively little research has studied the impact of test set contamination on generative evaluations. In this work, we quantitatively assess the effect of test set contamination on generative evaluations through the language model lifecycle. We pretrain language models on mixtures of web data and the MATH benchmark, sweeping model sizes and number of test set replicas contaminating the pretraining corpus; performance improves with contamination and model size. Using scaling laws, we make a surprising discovery: including even a single test set replica enables models to achieve lower loss than the irreducible error of training on the uncontaminated corpus. We then study further training: overtraining with fresh data reduces the effects of contamination, whereas supervised finetuning on the training set can either increase or decrease performance on test data, depending on the amount of pretraining contamination. Finally, at inference, we identify factors that modulate memorization: high sampling temperatures mitigate contamination effects, and longer solutions are exponentially more difficult to memorize than shorter ones, presenting a contrast with discriminative evaluations, where solutions are only a few tokens in length. By characterizing how generation and memorization interact, we highlight a new layer of complexity for trustworthy evaluation of AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5b9a\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u6c61\u67d3\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6c61\u67d3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5355\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u526f\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u7a81\u7834\u65e0\u6c61\u67d3\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6781\u9650\u3002\u6c61\u67d3\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u53d7\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u7d20\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u4e0e\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f62\u6210\u9c9c\u660e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "\u524d\u6cbfAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7f51\u9875\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u6c61\u67d3\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e25\u5cfb\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u5982\u9009\u62e9\u9898\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6c61\u67d3\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6c61\u67d3\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u5bf9\u7f3a\u4e4f\u3002", "method": "1) \u5728MATH\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u7f51\u9875\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u526f\u672c\u6570\u91cf\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u4f38\u7f29\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5206\u6790\u6c61\u67d3\u5bf9\u635f\u5931\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b3) \u7814\u7a76\u540e\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u65b0\u9c9c\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u5bf9\u6c61\u67d3\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u8c03\u6574\uff1b4) \u5206\u6790\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u91c7\u6837\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u751f\u6210\u957f\u5ea6\uff09\u3002", "result": "1) \u6c61\u67d3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5355\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u526f\u672c\u4f7f\u635f\u5931\u4f4e\u4e8e\u65e0\u6c61\u67d3\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b2) \u65b0\u9c9c\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f13\u89e3\u6c61\u67d3\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u6c61\u67d3\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8c03\u5236\uff1b3) \u9ad8\u6e29\u91c7\u6837\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u957f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u8f83\u96be\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08\u4e0e\u77ed\u6807\u8bb0\u5224\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u5f62\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u6c61\u67d3\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u957f\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u96be\u5ea6\u3001\u6e29\u5ea6\u8c03\u5236\u6548\u5e94\u7b49\u7279\u5f81\u663e\u8457\u533a\u522b\u4e8e\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3aAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4fe1\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this setting, the target variable is observed in the source domain but is entirely missing in the target domain. We aim to impute the target variable in the target domain from the remaining observed variables under various shifts. We frame this as learning a compact, mechanism-stable representation. This representation preserves information relevant for predicting the target while discarding spurious variation. For linear Gaussian causal models, we derive a closed-form Gaussian Information Bottleneck (GIB) solution. This solution reduces to a canonical correlation analysis (CCA)-style projection and offers Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-aware options when desired. For nonlinear or non-Gaussian data, we introduce a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) encoder-predictor. This approach scales to high dimensions and can be trained on source data and deployed zero-shot to the target domain.

Recent work shows that LLMs can engage in multi-turn negotiation, yet nearly all evaluations occur exclusively in English. Using controlled multi-agent simulations across Ultimatum, Buy-Sell, and Resource Exchange games, we systematically isolate language effects across English and four Indic framings (Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marwadi) by holding game rules, model parameters, and incentives constant across all conditions. We find that language choice can shift outcomes more strongly than changing models, reversing proposer advantages and reallocating surplus. Crucially, effects are task-contingent: Indic languages reduce stability in distributive games yet induce richer exploration in integrative settings. Our results demonstrate that evaluating LLM negotiation solely in English yields incomplete and potentially misleading conclusions. These findings caution against English-only evaluation of LLMs and suggest that culturally-aware evaluation is essential for fair deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Prior work that uses the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) has focused mostly on single-group bias along warmth and competence. We broaden that lens to intersectional bias by building compound representations for pairs of social identities through summation or concatenation, and by applying three debiasing strategies: Subtraction, Linear Projection, and Partial Projection. We study three widely used embedding families (Word2Vec, GloVe, and ConceptNet Numberbatch) and assess them with two complementary views of utility: whether local neighborhoods remain coherent and whether analogy behavior is preserved. Across models, SCM-based mitigation carries over well to the intersectional case and largely keeps the overall semantic landscape intact. The main cost is a familiar trade off: methods that most tightly preserve geometry tend to be more cautious about analogy behavior, while more assertive projections can improve analogies at the expense of strict neighborhood stability. Partial Projection is reliably conservative and keeps representations steady; Linear Projection can be more assertive; Subtraction is a simple baseline that remains competitive. The choice between summation and concatenation depends on the embedding family and the application goal. Together, these findings suggest that intersectional debiasing with SCM is practical in static embed- dings, and they offer guidance for selecting aggregation and debiasing settings when balancing stability against analogy performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u7fa4\u4f53\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e86\u4ea4\u53c9\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u548c\u6216\u62fc\u63a5\u6784\u5efa\u590d\u5408\u793e\u4f1a\u8eab\u4efd\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u53bb\u504f\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4e3b\u6d41\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8eSCM\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u53bb\u504f\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7c7b\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9759\u6001\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u5bb9\u6613\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5438\u6536\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u5185\u5bb9\u6a21\u578b(SCM)\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u7fa4\u4f53\u5728\u6e29\u6696\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u5904\u7406\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u53bb\u504f\u8303\u56f4\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4ea4\u53c9\u793e\u4f1a\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5bf9\u590d\u5408\u7fa4\u4f53\u8868\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u53bb\u504f\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u6c42\u548c\u4e0e\u62fc\u63a5\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u6784\u5efa\u4ea4\u53c9\u793e\u4f1a\u8eab\u4efd\uff08\u5982\"\u9ed1\u4eba\u5973\u6027\"\uff09\u7684\u590d\u5408\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u53bb\u504f\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u51cf\u6cd5\u53bb\u504f\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u6295\u5f71\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u6295\u5f71\u3002\u5728Word2Vec\u3001GloVe\u548cConceptNet Numberbatch\u4e09\u79cd\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u7c7b\u6bd4\u884c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u6301\u5ea6\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u89c6\u89d2\u8bc4\u4f30\u53bb\u504f\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eSCM\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4ea4\u53c9\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u5927\u4f53\u4fdd\u6301\u6574\u4f53\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ecf\u5178\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u4e25\u683c\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7c7b\u6bd4\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u66f4\u4e3a\u4fdd\u5b88\uff0c\u800c\u66f4\u6fc0\u8fdb\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u7c7b\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\u4f46\u4f1a\u727a\u7272\u90bb\u57df\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u90e8\u5206\u6295\u5f71\u6700\u4e3a\u4fdd\u5b88\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u6295\u5f71\u66f4\u5177\u4e3b\u52a8\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u57fa\u7ebf\u4ecd\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\uff08\u6c42\u548cvs\u62fc\u63a5\uff09\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8eSCM\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u53bb\u504f\u5728\u9759\u6001\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e73\u8861\u8bed\u4e49\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7c7b\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u53bb\u504f\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\u5404\u5177\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u9700\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We present model readability as a design principle enabling alignment, and PiNets as a modeling framework to pursue it in a deep learning context. PiNets are pseudo-linear networks that produce instance-wise linear predictions in an arbitrary feature space, making them linearly readable.

We term this Transitive Expert Error (TEE), distinct from Dunning-Kruger effects, requiring calibrated expertise as precondition. Mechanisms enabling reliable within-domain judgment become liabilities when structural similarity masks causal divergence. Two core mechanisms operate: structural similarity bias causes experts to overweight surface features (shared vocabulary, patterns, formal structure) while missing causal architecture differences; authority persistence maintains confidence across competence boundaries through social reinforcement and metacognitive failures (experts experience no subjective uncertainty as pattern recognition operates smoothly on familiar-seeming inputs.) These mechanism intensify under three conditions: shared vocabulary masking divergent processes, social pressure for immediate judgment, and delayed feedback. These findings extend to AI routing architectures (MoE systems, multi-model orchestration, tool-using agents, RAG systems) exhibiting routing-induced failures (wrong specialist selected) and coverage-induced failures (no appropriate specialist exists). Both produce a hallucination phenotype: confident, coherent, structurally plausible but causally incorrect outputs at domain boundaries. In human systems where mechanisms are cognitive black boxes; AI architectures make them explicit and addressable.

The proposed approach employs an interpretable fuzzy rule base instead of complex neural architectures, while maintaining competitive performance through two key innovations: a fuzzified Bellman equation with eligibility traces for stable multi-step credit assignment, and a memory-efficient segment-based experience replay mechanism for enhanced sample efficiency. Theoretical analysis proves the proposed method convergence under standard assumptions. Extensive evaluations in continuous control domains demonstrate that Enhanced-FQL($\u03bb$) achieves superior sample efficiency and reduced variance compared to n-step fuzzy TD and fuzzy SARSA($\u03bb$) baselines, while maintaining substantially lower computational complexity than deep RL alternatives such as DDPG.

We further introduce a just-in-time (JIT) compilation method to reduce compilation time and a cross-grammar caching mechanism to leverage the common sub-structures across different grammars. Additionally, we extend the previous PDA-based mask generation algorithm to the Earley-parser-based one and design a repetition compression algorithm to handle repetition structures in grammars. Evaluation results show that XGrammar 2 can achieve more than 6x speedup over the existing structured generation engines. Integrated with an LLM inference engine, XGrammar 2 can handle dynamic structured generation tasks with near-zero overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

RLV$^\\varepsilon$R: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Noisy Rewards", "comment": null, "summary": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a simple but powerful paradigm for training LLMs: sample a completion, verify it, and update. In practice, however, the verifier is almost never clean--unit tests probe only limited corner cases; human and synthetic labels are imperfect; and LLM judges (e.g., RLAIF) are noisy and can be exploited--and this problem worsens on harder domains (especially coding) where tests are sparse and increasingly model-generated. We ask a pragmatic question: does the verification noise merely slow down the learning (rate), or can it flip the outcome (fate)?\n  To address this, we develop an analytically tractable multi-armed bandit view of RLVR dynamics, instantiated with GRPO and validated in controlled experiments. Modeling false positives and false negatives and grouping completions into recurring reasoning modes yields a replicator-style (natural-selection) flow on the probability simplex. The dynamics decouples into within-correct-mode competition and a one-dimensional evolution for the mass on incorrect modes, whose drift is determined solely by Youden's index J=TPR-FPR. This yields a sharp phase transition: when J>0, the incorrect mass is driven toward extinction (learning); when J=0, the process is neutral; and when J<0, incorrect modes amplify until they dominate (anti-learning and collapse). In the learning regime J>0, noise primarily rescales convergence time (\"rate, not fate\"). Experiments on verifiable programming tasks under synthetic noise reproduce the predicted J=0 boundary.

While recent work has begun to explore unlearning in quantum machine learning, existing approaches largely rely on fixed, uniform target distributions and do not explicitly control the trade-off between forgetting and retained model behaviour. In this work, we propose a distribution-guided framework for class-level quantum machine unlearning that treats unlearning as a constrained optimization problem. Our method introduces a tunable target distribution derived from model similarity statistics, decoupling the suppression of forgotten-class confidence from assumptions about redistribution among retained classes. We further incorporate an anchor-based preservation constraint that explicitly maintains predictive behaviour on selected retained data, yielding a controlled optimization trajectory that limits deviation from the original model. We evaluate the approach on variational quantum classifiers trained on the Iris and Covertype datasets. Results demonstrate sharp suppression of forgotten-class confidence, minimal degradation of retained-class performance, and closer alignment with the gold retrained model baselines compared to uniform-target unlearning. These findings highlight the importance of target design and constraint-based formulations for reliable and interpretable quantum machine unlearning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

But AI systems, we argue, will not be able to comply with these regulations at the necessary speed and scale by continuing to rely on traditional, analogue methods of compliance. Instead, we posit that compliance with these regulations will only realistically be achieved computationally: that is, with algorithms that run across the life cycle of an AI system, automatically steering it toward AIR compliance in the face of dynamic conditions. Yet despite their (we would argue) inevitability, the research community has yet to specify exactly how these algorithms for computational AIR compliance should behave - or how we should benchmark their performance.

This dynamic, in which the deployment of the model influences the very outcome it seeks to predict, can lead to unintended consequences, including feedback loops, performance issues, and significant societal risks. While the literature in the field has grown rapidly in recent years, a socio-technical synthesis that systemises the phenomenon concepts and provides practical guidance has been lacking. This Systematisation of Knowledge (SoK) addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of the literature on performative predictions. We provide an overview of the primary mechanisms through which performativity manifests, present a typology of associated risks, and survey the proposed solutions offered in the literature. Our primary contribution is the ``Performative Strength vs. Impact Matrix\" assessment framework. This practical tool is designed to help practitioners assess the potential influence and severity of performativity on their deployed predictive models and select the appropriate level of algorithmic or human intervention.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) agents excel in navigation, they fail to autonomously discover defects due to two core challenges: \\textit{Goal-Oriented Masking}, where agents prioritize task completion over reporting anomalies, and \\textit{Execution-Bias Attribution}, where system defects are misidentified as agent errors. To address these, we first introduce \\textbf{GUITestBench}, the first interactive benchmark for this task, featuring 143 tasks across 26 defects. We then propose \\textbf{GUITester}, a multi-agent framework that decouples navigation from verification via two modules: (i) a \\textit{Planning-Execution Module (PEM)} that proactively probes for defects via embedded testing intents, and (ii) a \\textit{Hierarchical Reflection Module (HRM)} that resolves attribution ambiguity through interaction history analysis.

We develop and explain a predictive model for pLos using admission-level patient and hospital administrative data. The approach includes a feature selection method by selecting non-correlated features with the highest information value. The method uses features weights of evidence to select a representative within cliques from graph theory. The prognosis study analyzed the records from 120,354 hospital admissions at the Hospital Alma Mater de Antioquia between January 2017 and March 2022. After a cleaning process the dataset was split into training (67%), test (22%), and validation (11%) cohorts. A logistic regression model was trained to predict the pLoS in two classes: less than or greater than 7 days. The performance of the model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC-ROC metrics. The feature selection method returns nine interpretable variables, enhancing the models' transparency. In the validation cohort, the pLoS model achieved a specificity of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.82-0.84), sensitivity of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.62-0.65), accuracy of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.76-0.77), precision of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.66-0.69), and AUC-ROC of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.81-0.83).

In the second stage, supervised training on a small labeled dataset is performed, where the contrastive and cross-entropy losses are jointly optimized to improve the feature separability and strengthen the classification boundaries. In the third stage, an AL module selects the most valuable samples from the unlabeled data for annotation based on the uncertainty and representativeness criteria, further enhancing generalization under limited labeling budgets.

However, most advancements have focused on individualized problem-solving instead of collaborative, open-ended problem-solving, which may offer both affordances (richer data) and challenges (low cohesion) to behavioral prediction. Here, we extend predictive models to automatically detect socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) behaviors in collaborative computational modeling environments using embedding-based approaches. We leverage large language models (LLMs) as summarization tools to generate task-aware representations of student dialogue aligned with system logs. These summaries, combined with text-only embeddings, context-enriched embeddings, and log-derived features, were used to train predictive models. Results show that text-only embeddings often achieve stronger performance in detecting SSRL behaviors related to enactment or group dynamics (e.g., off-task behavior or requesting assistance). In contrast, contextual and multimodal features provide complementary benefits for constructs such as planning and reflection. Overall, our findings highlight the promise of embedding-based models for extending learning analytics by enabling scalable detection of SSRL behaviors, ultimately supporting real-time feedback and adaptive scaffolding in collaborative learning environments that teachers value.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u534f\u4f5c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5efa\u6a21\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5171\u4eab\u8c03\u8282\u5b66\u4e60\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u9886\u57df\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u534f\u4f5c\u5f0f\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u534f\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u65e2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e5f\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u4f4e\u5185\u805a\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6269\u5c55\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u793e\u4f1a\u5171\u4eab\u8c03\u8282\u5b66\u4e60\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6458\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u578b\u5b66\u751f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8868\u5f81\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u65e5\u5fd7\u884d\u751f\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u57fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u6267\u884c\u6216\u7fa4\u4f53\u52a8\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u7684SSRL\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u901a\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\uff1b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u7b49\u5efa\u6784\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u793e\u4f1a\u5171\u4eab\u8c03\u8282\u5b66\u4e60\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5d4c\u5165\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u671b\u6269\u5c55\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u793e\u4f1a\u5171\u4eab\u8c03\u8282\u5b66\u4e60\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6559\u5e08\u91cd\u89c6\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u652f\u67b6\u3002"}}

Identifying such models is challenging in practice, often requiring iterative checking and revision through trial and error. To this end, we propose meta-probabilistic modeling (MPM), a meta-learning algorithm that learns generative model structure directly from multiple related datasets. MPM uses a hierarchical architecture where global model specifications are shared across datasets while local parameters remain dataset-specific. For learning and inference, we propose a tractable VAE-inspired surrogate objective, and optimize it through bi-level optimization: local variables are updated analytically via coordinate ascent, while global parameters are trained with gradient-based methods. We evaluate MPM on object-centric image modeling and sequential text modeling, demonstrating that it adapts generative models to data while recovering meaningful latent representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We find that character counts are represented on low-dimensional curved manifolds discretized by sparse feature families, analogous to biological place cells. Accurate predictions emerge from a sequence of geometric transformations: token lengths are accumulated into character count manifolds, attention heads twist these manifolds to estimate distance to the line boundary, and the decision to break the line is enabled by arranging estimates orthogonally to create a linear decision boundary. We validate our findings through causal interventions and discover visual illusions--character sequences that hijack the counting mechanism.

Existing biomedical datasets focus on general or coarsegrained knowledge and thus fail to support the fine-grained experimental reasoning demanded by HID and MSR.

We evaluate information extraction methods on BioPIE, and implement a QA system that leverages BioPIE, showcasing performance gains on test, HID, and MSR question sets, showing that the structured experimental knowledge in BioPIE underpins both AI-assisted and more autonomous biomedical experimentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BioPIE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8cQA\u4e2d\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u5fc3\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6765\u652f\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u901a\u7528\u6216\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u4e3a\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ee5\u52a9\u529b\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8cQA\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaBiomedical Protocol Information Extraction Dataset\uff08BioPIE\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u4f53\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u5fc3\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728BioPIE\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8eBioPIE\u7684QA\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u3001\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "BioPIE\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e3aAI\u8f85\u52a9\u548c\u66f4\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u652f\u6491\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u5fc3\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8cQA\u6311\u6218\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

We present IGENBENCH, the first benchmark for evaluating the reliability of text-to-infographic generation, comprising 600 curated test cases spanning 30 infographic types. We design an automated evaluation framework that decomposes reliability verification into atomic yes/no questions based on a taxonomy of 10 question types.

Unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT), RLVR lets an LLM generate multiple candidate solutions and reinforces those that lead to a verifiably correct final answer. However, in practice, RLVR often requires thousands of training steps to reach strong performance, incurring substantial computation largely attributed to prolonged exploration. In this work, we make a surprising observation: during RLVR, LLMs evolve in a strongly linear manner. Specifically, both model weights and model output log-probabilities exhibit strong linear correlations with RL training steps. This suggests that RLVR predominantly amplifies trends that emerge early in training, rather than continuously discovering new behaviors throughout the entire optimization trajectory. Motivated by this linearity, we investigate whether future model states can be predicted from intermediate checkpoints via extrapolation, avoiding continued expensive training. We show that Weight Extrapolation produces models with performance comparable to standard RL training while requiring significantly less computation. Moreover, Logits Extrapolation consistently outperforms continued RL training on all four benchmarks by extrapolating beyond the step range where RL training remains stable.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While this design enables autonomy, it also expands the attack surface for backdoor threats. Backdoor triggers injected into specific stages of an agent workflow can persist through multiple intermediate states and adversely influence downstream outputs. However, existing studies remain fragmented and typically analyze individual attack vectors in isolation, leaving the cross-stage interaction and propagation of backdoor triggers poorly understood from an agent-centric perspective. To fill this gap, we propose \\textbf{BackdoorAgent}, a modular and stage-aware framework that provides a unified, agent-centric view of backdoor threats in LLM agents. BackdoorAgent structures the attack surface into three functional stages of agentic workflows, including \\textbf{planning attacks}, \\textbf{memory attacks}, and \\textbf{tool-use attacks}, and instruments agent execution to enable systematic analysis of trigger activation and propagation across different stages. Building on this framework, we construct a standardized benchmark spanning four representative agent applications: \\textbf{Agent QA}, \\textbf{Agent Code}, \\textbf{Agent Web}, and \\textbf{Agent Drive}, covering both language-only and multimodal settings. Our empirical analysis shows that \\textit{triggers implanted at a single stage can persist across multiple steps and propagate through intermediate states.} For instance, when using a GPT-based backbone, we observe trigger persistence in 43.58\\% of planning attacks, 77.97\\% of memory attacks, and 60.28\\% of tool-stage attacks, highlighting the vulnerabilities of the agentic workflow itself to backdoor threats.

Most existing studies in multimodal retrieval focus on capturing information in multimodal data that is similar to their paired texts, but often ignores the complementary information contained in multimodal data. In this study, we propose CIEA, a novel multimodal retrieval approach that employs Complementary Information Extraction and Alignment, which transforms both text and images in documents into a unified latent space and features a complementary information extractor designed to identify and preserve differences in the image representations. We optimize CIEA using two complementary contrastive losses to ensure semantic integrity and effectively capture the complementary information contained in images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CIEA, which achieves significant improvements over both divide-and-conquer models and universal dense retrieval models. We provide an ablation study, further discussions, and case studies to highlight the advancements achieved by CIEA.

This approach enables pseudo-label assignment even to samples that were previously excluded from training and facilitates contrastive learning that accounts for the confidence of both anchor and positive samples in a more principled manner.

In this work, we introduce an open recipe for training a video game playing foundation model designed for inference in realtime on a consumer GPU. We release all data (8300+ hours of high quality human gameplay), training and inference code, and pretrained checkpoints under an open license. We show that our best model is capable of playing a variety of 3D video games at a level competitive with human play. We use this recipe to systematically examine the scaling laws of behavior cloning to understand how the model's performance and causal reasoning varies with model and data scale. We first show in a simple toy problem that, for some types of causal reasoning, increasing both the amount of training data and the depth of the network results in the model learning a more causal policy. We then systematically study how causality varies with the number of parameters (and depth) and training steps in scaled models of up to 1.2 billion parameters, and we find similar scaling results to what we observe in the toy problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Yet, artificial intelligence has primarily advanced in digital modalities like text, vision, and audio. This paper outlines a research vision for multisensory artificial intelligence over the next decade. This new set of technologies can change how humans and AI experience and interact with one another, by connecting AI to the human senses and a rich spectrum of signals from physiological and tactile cues on the body, to physical and social signals in homes, cities, and the environment. We outline how this field must advance through three interrelated themes of sensing, science, and synergy. Firstly, research in sensing should extend how AI captures the world in richer ways beyond the digital medium.

The lack of structured data on scientific reasoning hinders systematic analysis and development of AI research agents. We introduce Sci-Reasoning, the first dataset capturing the intellectual synthesis behind high-quality AI research. Using community-validated quality signals and an LLM-accelerated, human-verified pipeline, we trace Oral and Spotlight papers across NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR (2023-2025) to its key predecessors, articulating specific reasoning links in a structured format. Our analysis identifies 15 distinct thinking patterns, with three dominant strategies accounting for 52.7%: Gap-Driven Reframing (24.2%), Cross-Domain Synthesis (18.0%), and Representation Shift (10.5%). The most powerful innovation recipes combine multiple patterns: Gap-Driven Reframing + Representation Shift, Cross-Domain Synthesis + Representation Shift, and Gap-Driven Reframing + Cross-Domain Synthesis.

Among advanced imputation methods, score-based diffusion models have demonstrated competitive performance. These models generate data by reversing a noising process, using observed values as conditional guidance. However, existing diffusion models typically apply a uniform guidance scale across both spatial and temporal dimensions, which is inadequate for nodes with high missing data rates. Sparse observations provide insufficient conditional guidance, causing the generative process to drift toward the learned prior distribution rather than closely following the conditional observations, resulting in suboptimal imputation performance.\n  To address this, we propose FENCE, a spatial-temporal feedback diffusion guidance method designed to adaptively control guidance scales during imputation. First, FENCE introduces a dynamic feedback mechanism that adjusts the guidance scale based on the posterior likelihood approximations. The guidance scale is increased when generated values diverge from observations and reduced when alignment improves, preventing overcorrection. Second, because alignment to observations varies across nodes and denoising steps, a global guidance scale for all nodes is suboptimal. FENCE computes guidance scales at the cluster level by grouping nodes based on their attention scores, leveraging spatial-temporal correlations to provide more accurate guidance. Experimental results on real-world traffic datasets show that FENCE significantly enhances imputation accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u65f6\u7a7a\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u63d2\u8865\u4e2d\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u5bfc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faFENCE\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u6307\u5bfc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4-\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u9988\u6269\u6563\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63d2\u8865\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u63d2\u8865\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u7f3a\u5931\u7387\u9ad8\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u3002\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u504f\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u800c\u975e\u7d27\u5bc6\u8ddf\u968f\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u63d2\u8865\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "FENCE\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff1a1) \u52a8\u6001\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u57fa\u4e8e\u540e\u9a8c\u4f3c\u7136\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8c03\u6574\u6307\u5bfc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u2014\u2014\u5f53\u751f\u6210\u503c\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u504f\u79bb\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\u6307\u5bfc\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u6539\u5584\u65f6\u5219\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6821\u6b63\uff1b2) \u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\u5bf9\u8282\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728\u96c6\u7fa4\u7ea7\u522b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6307\u5bfc\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4-\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFENCE\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63d2\u8865\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684FENCE\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u7f3a\u5931\u7387\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u63d2\u8865\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u63d2\u8865\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The framework integrates multiple knowledge transfer techniques--including traditional knowledge distillation, contrastive learning, and NKD--within a unified architecture that maintains privacy while reducing communication costs. Through experiments on healthcare datasets (SLEEP, UCI-HAR, and PAMAP2), FedKDX demonstrates improved accuracy (up to 2.53% over state-of-the-art methods), faster convergence, and better performance on non-IID data distributions. Theoretical analysis supports NKD's contribution to addressing statistical heterogeneity in distributed healthcare data.

Human evaluators, on the other hand, use a greater variety of language signs and retain more consistent confidence.

While these approaches can raise aggregate scores, they often yield unstable and hard-to-audit improvement trajectories, making it difficult to guarantee non-regression or to reason about failures across versions. We reframe agent improvement as \\textbf{release engineering}: agents are treated as shippable artifacts, and improvement is externalized into a regression-aware release pipeline. We introduce \\textbf{AgentDevel}, a release engineering pipeline that iteratively runs the current agent, produces implementation-blind, symptom-level quality signals from execution traces, synthesizes a single release candidate (RC) via executable diagnosis, and promotes it under flip-centered gating. AgentDevel features three core designs: (i) an implementation-blind LLM critic that characterizes failure appearances without accessing agent internals, (ii) script-based executable diagnosis that aggregates dominant symptom patterns and produces auditable engineering specifications, and (iii) flip-centered gating that prioritizes pass to fail regressions and fail to pass fixes as first-class evidence. Unlike population-based search or in-agent self-refinement, AgentDevel maintains a single canonical version line and emphasizes non-regression as a primary objective. Experiments on execution-heavy benchmarks demonstrate that AgentDevel yields stable improvements with significantly fewer regressions while producing reproducible, auditable artifacts. Overall, AgentDevel provides a practical development discipline for building, debugging, and releasing LLM agents as software development.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While many classic models assume context-independent choice behavior, a large body of behavioral research shows that preferences are often influenced by the composition of the choice set itself -- a phenomenon known as the context effect or Halo effect. These effects can manifest as pairwise (first-order) or even higher-order interactions among the available alternatives. Recent models that attempt to capture such effects either focus on the featureless setting or, in the feature-based setting, rely on restrictive interaction structures or entangle interactions across all orders, which limits interpretability. In this work, we propose DeepHalo, a neural modeling framework that incorporates features while enabling explicit control over interaction order and principled interpretation of context effects. Our model enables systematic identification of interaction effects by order and serves as a universal approximator of context-dependent choice functions when specialized to a featureless setting. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate strong predictive performance while providing greater transparency into the drivers of choice.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The Rumor Detection Agent combines (i) a synthetic data-augmented, fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier, (ii) precision keyword filtering, and (iii) a two-pass LLM verification pipeline using GPT-4o mini. The findings reveal that sharing probability rises steadily with each additional exposure, providing large-scale empirical evidence for dose-response belief reinforcement in ideologically homogeneous networks. Simulation results further demonstrate rapid contagion effects: nearly one quarter of users become \"infected\" within just four propagation iterations. Taken together, these results illustrate how LLMs can transform psychological science by enabling the rigorous measurement of belief dynamics and misinformation spread in massive, real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, several phenomena remain poorly understood, including the reduction in output diversity. To gain a broader understanding of RL post-training, we analyze the learning dynamics of RL post-training from a perspective that has been studied in supervised learning but remains underexplored in RL. We adopt an empirical neural tangent kernel (NTK) framework and decompose the NTK into two components to characterize how RL updates propagate across training samples. Our analysis reveals that limited variability in feature representations can cause RL updates to systematically increase model confidence, providing an explanation for the commonly observed reduction in output diversity after RL post-training. Furthermore, we show that effective learning in this regime depends on rapidly shaping the classifier, which directly affects the gradient component of the NTK. Motivated by these insights, we propose classifier-first reinforcement learning (CF-RL), a simple two-stage training strategy that prioritizes classifier updates before standard RL optimization. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis by demonstrating increased model confidence and accelerated optimization under CF-RL. Additional analysis shows that the mechanism underlying CF-RL differs from that of linear-probing-then-fine-tuning in supervised learning. Overall, our study formalizes the learning dynamics of RL post-training and motivates further analysis and improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper focuses on estimating causal effects in Gaussian Linear Structural Causal Models (GL-SCMs), which are widely used due to their analytical tractability. However, parameter estimation in GL-SCMs is often infeasible with finite data, primarily due to overparameterization. To address this, we introduce the class of Centralized Gaussian Linear SCMs (CGL-SCMs), a simplified yet expressive subclass where exogenous variables follow standardized distributions. We show that CGL-SCMs are equally expressive in terms of causal effect identifiability from observational distributions and present a novel EM-based estimation algorithm that can learn CGL-SCM parameters and estimate identifiable causal effects from finite observational samples. Our theoretical analysis is validated through experiments on synthetic data and benchmark causal graphs, demonstrating that the learned models accurately recover causal distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The framework includes beam search for tactics, tactics reranker ML and RL models, premise selection with small transformer models, micro-RAG for Isar proofs built from AFP, and counter-example guided proof repair.

In this work, we propose a simple yet effective solution that projects user and item embeddings, learned from collaborative filtering, into the LLM token space via separate lightweight projector modules.

In this work, we study the resilience of LLM-based MAS under perturbations and find that both the communication topology and prompt design significantly influence system resilience. Motivated by these findings, we propose ResMAS: a two-stage framework for enhancing MAS resilience. First, we train a reward model to predict the MAS's resilience, based on which we train a topology generator to automatically design resilient topology for specific tasks through reinforcement learning. Second, we introduce a topology-aware prompt optimization method that refines each agent's prompt based on its connections and interactions with other agents. Extensive experiments across a range of tasks show that our approach substantially improves MAS resilience under various constraints. Moreover, our framework demonstrates strong generalization ability to new tasks and models, highlighting its potential for building resilient MASs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We develop a formal information-theoretic framework for quantifying how much predictive structure fine-tuning extracts from the train dataset and writes into a model's parameters. Our central quantity, Excess Description Length (EDL), is defined via prequential coding and measures the gap between the bits required to encode training labels sequentially using an evolving model (trained online) and the residual encoding cost under the final trained model. We establish that EDL is non-negative in expectation, converges to surplus description length in the infinite-data limit, and provides bounds on expected generalization gain. Through a series of toy models, we clarify common confusions about information in learning: why random labels yield EDL near zero, how a single example can eliminate many bits of uncertainty about the underlying rule(s) that describe the data distribution, why structure learned on rare inputs contributes proportionally little to expected generalization, and how format learning creates early transients distinct from capability acquisition.

To address these challenges, we propose TourPlanner, a comprehensive framework featuring multi-path reasoning and constraint-gated reinforcement learning.

Subsequently, we propose Competitive consensus Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), a multi-path reasoning paradigm that improves the ability of exploring the feasible solution space. To further refine the plan, we integrate a sigmoid-based gating mechanism into the reinforcement learning stage, which dynamically prioritizes soft-constraint satisfaction only after hard constraints are met.

Forecasts are first validated against satellite-derived surface solar irradiance (SSI). Irradiance fields are then converted into PV power using station-specific machine learning models, enabling comparison with production data from 6434 PV stations across Switzerland.

Our results show that satellite-based approaches outperform the Integrated Forecast System (IFS-ENS), particularly at short lead times. Among them, SolarSTEPS and SHADECast deliver the most accurate SSI and PV power predictions, with SHADECast providing the most reliable ensemble spread.

The reliance on human observation often leads to delays in identifying symptoms, as the sheer number of animals can hinder timely attention to each cow. Consequently, the accuracy and precision of disease detection are significantly compromised, potentially affecting animal health and overall farm productivity. Furthermore, organizing and managing human resources for the manual observation and monitoring of cow health is a complex and economically demanding task. It necessitates the involvement of skilled personnel, thereby contributing to elevated farm maintenance costs and operational inefficiencies. Therefore, the development of an automated, low-cost, and reliable smart system is essential to address these challenges effectively. Although several studies have been conducted in this domain, very few have simultaneously considered the detection of multiple common diseases with high prediction accuracy. However, advancements in Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), and Cyber-Physical Systems have enabled the automation of cow health monitoring with enhanced accuracy and reduced operational costs. This study proposes an IoT-enabled Cyber-Physical System framework designed to monitor the daily activities and health status of cow. A novel ML algorithm is proposed for the diagnosis of common cow diseases using collected physiological and behavioral data. The algorithm is designed to predict multiple diseases by analyzing a comprehensive set of recorded physiological and behavioral features, enabling accurate and efficient health assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing methods suffer from unstructured reasoning, poor generalization, and misalignment with human driving intent. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances decision transparency, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) fails to fully exploit its potential, and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches face instability and suboptimal reasoning depth. We propose ThinkDrive, a CoT guided progressive RL fine-tuning framework for autonomous driving that synergizes explicit reasoning with difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimization. Our method employs a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform SFT using CoT explanations. Then, we apply progressive RL with a difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimizer that dynamically adjusts learning intensity based on sample complexity. We evaluate our approach on a public dataset. The results show that ThinkDrive outperforms strong RL baselines by 1.45%, 1.95%, and 1.01% on exam, easy-exam, and accuracy, respectively.

We introduce AgentOCR, a framework that exploits the superior information density of visual tokens by representing the accumulated observation-action history as a compact rendered image. To make multi-turn rollouts scalable, AgentOCR proposes segment optical caching. By decomposing history into hashable segments and maintaining a visual cache, this mechanism eliminates redundant re-rendering. Beyond fixed rendering, AgentOCR introduces agentic self-compression, where the agent actively emits a compression rate and is trained with compression-aware reward to adaptively balance task success and token efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on challenging agentic benchmarks, ALFWorld and search-based QA. Remarkably, results demonstrate that AgentOCR preserves over 95\\% of text-based agent performance while substantially reducing token consumption (>50\\%), yielding consistent token and memory efficiency.

While machine learning (ML) has been used to support electrospinning process optimisation, most existing approaches predict only mean fibre diameters, neglecting the full diameter distribution that governs scaffold performance. This work presents FibreCastML, an open, distribution-aware ML framework that predicts complete fibre diameter spectra from routinely reported electrospinning parameters and provides interpretable insights into process structure relationships.\n  A meta-dataset comprising 68538 individual fibre diameter measurements extracted from 1778 studies across 16 biomedical polymers was curated. Six standard processing parameters, namely solution concentration, applied voltage, flow rate, tip to collector distance, needle diameter, and collector rotation speed, were used to train seven ML models using nested cross validation with leave one study out external folds. Model interpretability was achieved using variable importance analysis, SHapley Additive exPlanations, correlation matrices, and three dimensional parameter maps.\n  Non linear models consistently outperformed linear baselines, achieving coefficients of determination above 0.91 for several widely used polymers.

In most environments, information is distributed across isolated files like reports and logs that lack explicit links. Standard search engines process files independently, ignoring the connections between them. Furthermore, manually building Knowledge Graphs is impractical for such vast data. To bridge this gap, we present Orion-RAG. Our core insight is simple yet effective: we do not need heavy algorithms to organize this data. Instead, we use a low-complexity strategy to extract lightweight paths that naturally link related concepts. We demonstrate that this streamlined approach suffices to transform fragmented documents into semi-structured data, enabling the system to link information across different files effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Orion-RAG consistently outperforms mainstream frameworks across diverse domains, supporting real-time updates and explicit Human-in-the-Loop verification with high cost-efficiency. Experiments on FinanceBench demonstrate superior precision with a 25.2% relative improvement over strong baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Prior work suggests that stochastic gradient noise induces a Brownian-like expansion of the weight matrices W, whose growth is counteracted by WD, leading to a WD-noise equilibrium with a certain weight norm ||W||. In this work, we view the equilibrium norm as a harmful artifact of the training procedure, and address it by introducing learnable multipliers to learn the optimal scale. First, we attach a learnable scalar multiplier to W and confirm that the WD-noise equilibrium norm is suboptimal: the learned scale adapts to data and improves performance. We then argue that individual row and column norms are similarly constrained, and free their scale by introducing learnable per-row and per-column multipliers. Our method can be viewed as a learnable, more expressive generalization of muP multipliers. It outperforms a well-tuned muP baseline, reduces the computational overhead of multiplier tuning, and surfaces practical questions such as forward-pass symmetries and the width-scaling of the learned multipliers. Finally, we validate learnable multipliers with both Adam and Muon optimizers, where it shows improvement in downstream evaluations matching the improvement of the switching from Adam to Muon.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Agentic Reinforcement Learning has recently drawn significant research attention as a critical post-training paradigm to further refine these capabilities. In this paper, we present AT$^2$PO (Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization via Tree Search), a unified framework for multi-turn agentic RL that addresses three core challenges: limited exploration diversity, sparse credit assignment, and misaligned policy optimization. AT$^2$PO introduces a turn-level tree structure that jointly enables Entropy-Guided Tree Expansion for strategic exploration and Turn-wise Credit Assignment for fine-grained reward propagation from sparse outcomes. Complementing this, we propose Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization, a turn-level learning objective that aligns policy updates with the natural decision granularity of agentic interactions. ATPO is orthogonal to tree search and can be readily integrated into any multi-turn RL pipeline.

These invariants enrich the concept of cardinality by evaluating the `effective diversity' of a metric space, and as such represent a natural solution to overly homogeneous training data.

Extensive experiments reveal that reward precision, rather than constraint diversity, is the primary driver of effective alignment. The LLM judge suffers from a low recall rate in detecting false response, which leads to severe reward hacking, thereby undermining the benefits of diversity. Furthermore, analysis of the attention mechanism reveals that high-precision rewards develop a transferable meta-skill for IF.

For a single instance, many valid counterfactuals can exist, which leaves open the possibility for an explanation provider to cherry-pick explanations that better suit a narrative of their choice, highlighting favourable behaviour and withholding examples that reveal problematic behaviour. We formally define cherry-picking for counterfactual explanations in terms of an admissible explanation space, specified by the generation procedure, and a utility function. We then study to what extent an external auditor can detect such manipulation. Considering three levels of access to the explanation process: full procedural access, partial procedural access, and explanation-only access, we show that detection is extremely limited in practice. Even with full procedural access, cherry-picked explanations can remain difficult to distinguish from non cherry-picked explanations, because the multiplicity of valid counterfactuals and flexibility in the explanation specification provide sufficient degrees of freedom to mask deliberate selection. Empirically, we demonstrate that this variability often exceeds the effect of cherry-picking on standard counterfactual quality metrics such as proximity, plausibility, and sparsity, making cherry-picked explanations statistically indistinguishable from baseline explanations. We argue that safeguards should therefore prioritise reproducibility, standardisation, and procedural constraints over post-hoc detection, and we provide recommendations for algorithm developers, explanation providers, and auditors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u6a31\u6843\u91c7\u6458\uff08\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5448\u73b0\u6709\u5229\u89e3\u91ca\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u4fdd\u8bc1\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea6\u675f\u800c\u975e\u4e8b\u540e\u68c0\u6d4b", "motivation": "\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5448\u73b0\u6709\u5229\u7684\u3001\u63a9\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5916\u90e8\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8005\u68c0\u6d4b\u6b64\u7c7b\u64cd\u7eb5\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u80fd\u529b", "method": "\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a31\u6843\u91c7\u6458\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u5bb9\u8bb8\u89e3\u91ca\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8bbf\u95ee\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff1a\u5b8c\u6574\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bbf\u95ee\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bbf\u95ee\u3001\u4ec5\u89e3\u91ca\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a31\u6843\u91c7\u6458\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u63a5\u8fd1\u5ea6\u3001\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5dee\u5f02", "result": "\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u6781\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6709\u5b8c\u6574\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bbf\u95ee\u6743\u9650\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u89c4\u683c\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6311\u9009\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u672a\u6311\u9009\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u4e5f\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u6807\u51c6\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u5e38\u8d85\u8fc7\u6a31\u6843\u91c7\u6458\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4f7f\u4e24\u7c7b\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u5173\u6ce8\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ea6\u675f\u800c\u975e\u4e8b\u540e\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u548c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f8\u5e94\u5efa\u8bae"}}

However, their performance mainly stems from thinking, a long Chain of Thought (CoT), which significantly increase computational overhead. To address this overthinking problem, existing work focuses on using reinforcement learning (RL) to train hybrid reasoning models that automatically decide whether to engage in thinking or not based on the complexity of the query. Unfortunately, using RL will suffer the the reward hacking problem, e.g., the model engages in thinking but is judged as not doing so, resulting in incorrect rewards. To mitigate this problem, existing works either employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which incurs high computational costs, or enforce uniform token limits on non-thinking responses, which yields limited mitigation of the problem. In this paper, we propose Thinking-Based Non-Thinking (TNT). It does not employ SFT, and sets different maximum token usage for responses not using thinking across various queries by leveraging information from the solution component of the responses using thinking. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that TNT reduces token usage by around 50% compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B/7B and DeepScaleR-1.5B, while significantly improving accuracy. In fact, TNT achieves the optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among all tested methods. Additionally, the probability of reward hacking problem in TNT's responses, which are classified as not using thinking, remains below 10% across all tested datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "TNT\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8003\u57fa\u975e\u601d\u8003\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u6027\u80fd\u5353\u8d8a\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5197\u957f\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe(CoT)\uff0c\u8fd9\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u9488\u5bf9'\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003'\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u8fdb\u884c\u601d\u8003\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u601d\u8003\u5374\u88ab\u5224\u5b9a\u4e3a\u672a\u601d\u8003\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5956\u52b1\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6848\u8981\u4e48\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u7f13\u89e3\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faThinking-Based Non-Thinking (TNT)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4e0d\u91c7\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03(SFT)\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5229\u7528\u4f7f\u7528\u601d\u8003\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u672a\u4f7f\u7528\u601d\u8003\u54cd\u5e94\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6807\u8bb0\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cTNT\u76f8\u6bd4DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B/7B\u548cDeepScaleR-1.5B\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea650%\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u88ab\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u672a\u4f7f\u7528\u601d\u8003\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4fdd\u6301\u572810%\u4ee5\u4e0b\u3002", "conclusion": "TNT\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8003\u57fa\u975e\u601d\u8003\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

To jointly address these issues, we propose SCALER (Synthetic sCalable Adaptive Learning Environment for Reasoning), a framework that sustains effective learning signals through adaptive environment design. SCALER introduces a scalable synthesis pipeline that converts real-world programming problems into verifiable reasoning environments with controllable difficulty and unbounded instance generation, enabling RL training beyond finite datasets while preserving strong correctness guarantees. Building on this, SCALER further employs an adaptive multi-environment RL strategy that dynamically adjusts instance difficulty and curates the active set of environments to track the model's capability frontier and maintain distributional diversity. This co-adaptation prevents reward sparsity, mitigates overfitting to narrow task patterns, and supports sustained improvement throughout training.

We present AECV-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal and vision-language models on realistic AEC artefacts via two complementary use cases: (i) object counting on 120 high-quality floor plans (doors, windows, bedrooms, toilets), and (ii) drawing-grounded document QA spanning 192 question-answer pairs that test text extraction (OCR), instance counting, spatial reasoning, and comparative reasoning over common drawing regions. Object-counting performance is reported using per-field exact-match accuracy and MAPE results, while document-QA performance is reported using overall accuracy and per-category breakdowns with an LLM-as-a-judge scoring pipeline and targeted human adjudication for edge cases. Evaluating a broad set of state-of-the-art models under a unified protocol, we observe a stable capability gradient; OCR and text-centric document QA are strongest (up to 0.95 accuracy), spatial reasoning is moderate, and symbol-centric drawing understanding - especially reliable counting of doors and windows - remains unsolved (often 0.40-0.55 accuracy) with substantial proportional errors.

Recently, however, non-equivariant models have regained attention, due to their better runtime performance and imperfect symmetries that might arise in real-world applications. This has motivated the development of approximately equivariant models that strike a middle ground between respecting symmetries and fitting the data distribution. Existing approaches in this field usually apply sample-based regularisers which depend on data augmentation at training time, incurring a high sample complexity, in particular for continuous groups such as $SO(3)$. This work instead approaches approximate equivariance via a projection-based regulariser which leverages the orthogonal decomposition of linear layers into equivariant and non-equivariant components. In contrast to existing methods, this penalises non-equivariance at an operator level across the full group orbit, rather than point-wise. We present a mathematical framework for computing the non-equivariance penalty exactly and efficiently in both the spatial and spectral domain. In our experiments, our method consistently outperforms prior approximate equivariance approaches in both model performance and efficiency, achieving substantial runtime gains over sample-based regularisers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing approaches assign identical LoRA ranks to all experts, overlooking the intrinsic functional specialization within MoE LLMs. This uniform allocation leads to resource mismatch, task-relevant experts are under-provisioned while less relevant ones receive redundant parameters. We propose a Dynamic Rank LoRA framework named DR-LoRA, which dynamically grows expert LoRA ranks during fine-tuning based on task-specific demands. DR-LoRA employs an Expert Saliency Scoring mechanism that integrates expert routing frequency and LoRA rank importance to quantify each expert's demand for additional capacity. Experts with higher saliency scores are prioritized for rank expansion, enabling the automatic formation of a heterogeneous rank distribution tailored to the target task. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DR-LoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA and static allocation strategies under the same parameter budget, achieving superior task performance with more efficient parameter utilization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We address this inefficiency by proposing OI-MAS framework, a novel multi-agent framework that implements an adaptive model-selection policy across a heterogeneous pool of multi-scale LLMs. Specifically, OI-MAS introduces a state-dependent routing mechanism that dynamically selects agent roles and model scales throughout the reasoning process. In addition, we introduce a confidence-aware mechanism that selects appropriate model scales conditioned on task complexity, thus reducing unnecessary reliance on large-scale models. Experimental results show that OI-MAS consistently outperforms baseline multi-agent systems, improving accuracy by up to 12.88\\% while reducing cost by up to 79.78\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In our method, task-specific prompts facilitate more effective feature learning for the current task, while corresponding prototypes capture the representative features of the input.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer inferential capabilities, they often depend on retrieval-augmented contexts that lack structural depth. Traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) attempt to bridge this gap, yet their pairwise constraints fail to capture the irreducible higher-order interactions that govern emergent physical behavior. To address this, we introduce a methodology for constructing hypergraph-based knowledge representations that faithfully encode multi-entity relationships. Applied to a corpus of ~1,100 manuscripts on biocomposite scaffolds, our framework constructs a global hypergraph of 161,172 nodes and 320,201 hyperedges, revealing a scale-free topology (power law exponent ~1.23) organized around highly connected conceptual hubs. This representation prevents the combinatorial explosion typical of pairwise expansions and explicitly preserves the co-occurrence context of scientific formulations. We further demonstrate that equipping agentic systems with hypergraph traversal tools, specifically using node-intersection constraints, enables them to bridge semantically distant concepts. By exploiting these higher-order pathways, the system successfully generates grounded mechanistic hypotheses for novel composite materials, such as linking cerium oxide to PCL scaffolds via chitosan intermediates. This work establishes a \"teacherless\" agentic reasoning system where hypergraph topology acts as a verifiable guardrail, accelerating scientific discovery by uncovering relationships obscured by traditional graph methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This structured analysis provides valuable insights into the acceptance and criticism of Learning Analytics among students.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7SELAQ\u95ee\u5377\u5206\u6790\u5b66\u751f\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u7684\u671f\u671b\u548c\u4fe1\u5fc3\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u56db\u79cd\u5b66\u751f\u7fa4\u4f53\uff1a\u70ed\u5fc3\u8005\u3001\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e3b\u4e49\u8005\u3001\u8c28\u614e\u8005\u548c\u6f20\u4e0d\u5173\u5fc3\u8005\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u548c\u6279\u8bc4\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3", "motivation": "\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u9700\u8981\u9075\u5b88\u65e5\u76ca\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u4e86\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u9662\u7cfb\u5b66\u751f\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u5904\u7406\u5176\u6570\u636e\u7684\u671f\u671b\u548c\u4fe1\u5fc3", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u5b66\u751f\u671f\u671b\u95ee\u5377\uff08SELAQ\uff09\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u671f\u671b\u548c\u4fe1\u5fc3", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u56db\u4e2a\u5b66\u751f\u7fa4\u4f53\uff1a1\uff09\u70ed\u5fc3\u8005\uff08Enthusiasts\uff09-\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u6301\u79ef\u6781\u6001\u5ea6\uff0c2\uff09\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e3b\u4e49\u8005\uff08Realists\uff09- \u6301\u73b0\u5b9e\u4f46\u8c28\u614e\u6001\u5ea6\uff0c3\uff09\u8c28\u614e\u8005\uff08Cautious\uff09- \u62c5\u5fe7\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c4\uff09\u6f20\u4e0d\u5173\u5fc3\u8005\uff08Indifferents\uff09- \u5bf9\u6b64\u8bdd\u9898\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5174\u8da3", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u63a5\u53d7\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u6279\u8bc4\u6001\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u5b9e\u65bd\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u5b66\u751f\u89c2\u70b9\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u53c2\u8003"}}

So, we need to quickly find a new safe plan. Replanning only the delayed agent often does not result in an efficient plan, and sometimes cannot even yield a feasible plan. On the other hand, replanning other agents may lead to a cascade of changes and delays. We show how to efficiently replan by tracking and using the temporal flexibility of other agents while avoiding cascading delays. This flexibility is the maximum delay an agent can take without changing the order of or further delaying more agents. Our algorithm, FlexSIPP, precomputes all possible plans for the delayed agent, also returning the changes for the other agents, for any single-agent delay within the given scenario. We demonstrate our method in a real-world case study of replanning trains in the densely-used Dutch railway network.

We propose sequential noise scheduling, which distributes the noise budget across orthogonal subspaces of the parameter space, rather than injecting it all at once. This simple modification mitigates the destructive effect of noise while preserving the original certification guarantees. We extend the analysis of noisy fine-tuning to the subspace setting, proving that the same $(\\varepsilon,\u03b4)$ privacy budget is retained. Empirical results on image classification benchmarks show that our approach substantially improves accuracy after unlearning while remaining robust to membership inference attacks.

This paper advances the traditional job shop scheduling problem by incorporating additional complexities through the simultaneous integration of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and tool-sharing systems. We propose a novel approach that combines Colored-Timed Petri Nets (CTPNs) with actor-critic model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), effectively addressing the multifaceted challenges associated with FMS. CTPNs provide a formal modeling structure and dynamic action masking, significantly reducing the action search space, while MBRL ensures adaptability to changing environments through the learned policy. Leveraging the advantages of MBRL, we incorporate a lookahead strategy for optimal positioning of AGVs, improving operational efficiency. Our approach was evaluated on small-sized public benchmarks and a newly developed large-scale benchmark inspired by the Taillard benchmark. The results show that our approach matches traditional methods on smaller instances and outperforms them on larger ones in terms of makespan while achieving a tenfold reduction in computation time. To ensure reproducibility, we propose a gym-compatible environment and an instance generator.

However, existing models predominantly focus on short-horizon predictions and suffer from notorious computational costs and memory consumption when scaling to long-horizon predictions and large graphs. Targeting the above challenges, we present FaST, an effective and efficient framework based on heterogeneity-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) for long-horizon and large-scale STG forecasting, which unlocks one-week-ahead (672 steps at a 15-minute granularity) prediction with thousands of nodes. FaST is underpinned by two key innovations. First, an adaptive graph agent attention mechanism is proposed to alleviate the computational burden inherent in conventional graph convolution and self-attention modules when applied to large-scale graphs. Second, we propose a new parallel MoE module that replaces traditional feed-forward networks with Gated Linear Units (GLUs), enabling an efficient and scalable parallel structure. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FaST not only delivers superior long-horizon predictive accuracy but also achieves remarkable computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

We formalize this problem and introduce \\textbf{DVD} (\\textbf{D}etection via \\textbf{V}ariance of generation \\textbf{D}istribution), a single-sample detector that models the local output distribution induced by temperature sampling. Our key insight is that contaminated items trigger alternation between a \\emph{memory-adherence} state and a \\emph{perturbation-drift} state, yielding abnormally high variance in the synthetic difficulty of low-probability tokens; uncontaminated items remain in drift with comparatively smooth variance. We construct the first benchmark for variant contamination across two domains Omni-MATH and SuperGPQA by generating and filtering semantically equivalent variants, and simulate contamination via fine-tuning models of different scales and architectures (Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1). Across datasets and models, \\textbf{DVD} consistently outperforms perplexity-based, Min-$k$\\%++, edit-distance (CDD), and embedding-similarity baselines, while exhibiting strong robustness to hyperparameters.

We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208 admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models to reweight the JHFRAT scoring weights, while preserving its additive structure and clinical thresholds. Recalibration refers to adjusting item weights so that the resulting score can order encounters more consistently by the study's risk labels, and without changing the tool's form factor or deployment workflow. The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). This performance improvement translates to protecting an additional 35 high-risk patients per week across the Johns Hopkins Health System. The constrained score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression (AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk labeling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Such an approach is applied in a variety of real-world domains, including risk management, automated stream data analysis, and malware detection. More recently, a novel diverse planning paradigm, referred to as behaviour planning, has been proposed. This approach extends earlier methods by explicitly incorporating a diversity model into the planning process and supporting multiple planning categories. In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of behaviour planning in real-world settings by presenting three case studies.

Yet students, especially those with lower self-regulated learning (SRL) competence, often struggle to engage with and interpret analytics feedback. Conversational generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) assistants have shown potential to scaffold this process through real-time, personalised, dialogue-based support. Further advancing this potential, we explored authentic dialogues between students and GenAI assistant integrated into LAD during a 10-week semester. The analysis focused on questions students with different SRL levels posed, the relevance and quality of the assistant's answers, and how students perceived the assistant's role in their learning. Findings revealed distinct query patterns. While low SRL students sought clarification and reassurance, high SRL students queried technical aspects and requested personalised strategies. The assistant provided clear and reliable explanations but limited in personalisation, handling emotionally charged queries, and integrating multiple data points for tailored responses. Findings further extend that GenAI interventions can be especially valuable for low SRL students, offering scaffolding that supports engagement with feedback and narrows gaps with their higher SRL peers.

We propose that current architectures operate in a \"Metric Phase,\" where causal order is vulnerable to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Here, we identify robust inference as an effective Symmetry-Protected Topological phase, where logical operations are formally isomorphic to non-Abelian anyon braiding, replacing fragile geometric interpolation with robust topological invariants. Empirically, we demonstrate a sharp topological phase transition: while Transformers and RNNs exhibit gapless decay, our Holonomic Network reveals a macroscopic \"mass gap,\" maintaining invariant fidelity below a critical noise threshold. Furthermore, in a variable-binding task on $S_{10}$ ($3.6 \\times 10^6$ states) representing symbolic manipulation, we demonstrate holonomic generalization: the topological model maintains perfect fidelity extrapolating $100\\times$ beyond training ($L=50 \\to 5000$), consistent with a theoretically indefinite causal horizon, whereas Transformers lose logical coherence. Ablation studies indicate this protection emerges strictly from non-Abelian gauge symmetry. This provides strong evidence for a new universality class for logical reasoning, linking causal stability to the topology of the semantic manifold.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper presents a case study of using ChatGPT for rapid prototyping in ESA's ELOPE (Event-based Lunar OPtical flow Egomotion estimation) competition. The competition required participants to process event camera data to estimate lunar lander trajectories. Despite joining late, we achieved second place with a score of 0.01282, highlighting the potential of human-AI collaboration in competitive scientific settings. ChatGPT contributed not only executable code but also algorithmic reasoning, data handling routines, and methodological suggestions, such as using fixed number of events instead of fixed time spans for windowing.

Our approach features two key innovations: (1) Adaptive Compression Encoding, which replaces artificial compression quotas with a global optimization strategy that preserves the graph's natural hierarchical organization, and (2) Semantic-Structural Entropy ($S^2$-Entropy), which jointly optimizes for both structural cohesion and semantic consistency when creating hierarchical partitions.

While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on reasoning traces is a standard paradigm for the 'cold start' phase, applying existing compression techniques to these traces often compromises logical coherence or incurs prohibitive sampling costs. In this paper, we introduce ConMax (Confidence-Maximizing Compression), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to automatically compress reasoning traces while preserving essential reasoning patterns. ConMax formulates compression as a reward-driven optimization problem, training a policy to prune redundancy by maximizing a weighted combination of answer confidence for predictive fidelity and thinking confidence for reasoning validity through a frozen auxiliary LRM. Extensive experiments across five reasoning datasets demonstrate that ConMax achieves a superior efficiency-performance trade-off.

Empirical evaluations on leading LRMs (e.g., Gemini-3-Pro, DeepSeek-v3.2-Speciale and GPT-o3) reveal substantial performance heterogeneity: while models perform well on non-optimized tasks (up to 92%), accuracy drops sharply to around 49% on globally optimized algorithms such as dynamic programming. Further analysis uncovers \\textbf{strategic over-shifts}, wherein models prematurely abandon correct algorithmic designs due to necessary low-entropy tokens. These findings expose fundamental limitations of problem-centric reinforcement learning and highlight the necessity of an algorithm-centric training paradigm for robust algorithmic reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdAlgBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b56\u5212\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b3000+\u539f\u521b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8986\u76d627\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u56de\u7b54\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u638c\u63e1\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u8fd9\u4e00\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u800c\u975e\u7b97\u6cd5\u539f\u7406\u638c\u63e1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b3000\u591a\u4e2a\u539f\u521b\u95ee\u9898\u7684AlgBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d627\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7531ACM\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6b27\u6c0f/\u975e\u6b27\u6c0f\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u975e\u4f18\u5316/\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316/\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316/\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u7b49\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff08\u6700\u9ad892%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7b49\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9aa4\u964d\u81f349%\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728'\u7b56\u7565\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8f6c\u6362'\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f1a\u56e0\u4f4e\u71b5\u4ee4\u724c\u9700\u6c42\u8fc7\u65e9\u653e\u5f03\u6b63\u786e\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8f6c\u5411\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Our findings reveal that LLMs lack an inherent ability to detect and correct subtle distortions in table representations. Only when provided with an explicit prior, via a system prompt, do models partially adjust their reasoning strategies and correct some distortions, though not consistently or completely. To study this phenomenon, we introduce a small, expert-curated dataset that explicitly evaluates LLMs on table question answering (TQA) tasks requiring an additional error-correction step prior to analysis. Our results reveal systematic differences in how LLMs ingest and interpret tabular information under distortion, with even SoTA models such as GPT-5.2 model exhibiting a drop of minimum 22% accuracy under distortion.

However, most existing methods rely on statically selecting top-k passages based on individual relevance, which fails to exploit combinatorial gains among passages and often introduces substantial redundancy. To address this limitation, we propose OptiSet, a set-centric framework that unifies set selection and set-level ranking for RAG. OptiSet adopts an \"Expand-then-Refine\" paradigm: it first expands a query into multiple perspectives to enable a diverse candidate pool and then refines the candidate pool via re-selection to form a compact evidence set. We then devise a self-synthesis strategy without strong LLM supervision to derive preference labels from the set conditional utility changes of the generator, thereby identifying complementary and redundant evidence.

By pushing the boundaries of existing hyperparameter research in terms of scale, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between these two paradigms. Our empirical results challenge the scalability of the widely adopted $\u03bc$ Transfer in large-scale pre-training scenarios.

When using a \"jailbroken\" GPT-4o variant with guardrails removed, the AI was as effective at increasing conspiracy belief as decreasing it. Concerningly, the bunking AI was rated more positively, and increased trust in AI, more than the debunking AI. Surprisingly, we found that using standard GPT-4o produced very similar effects, such that the guardrails imposed by OpenAI did little to revent the LLM from promoting conspiracy beliefs. Encouragingly, however, a corrective conversation reversed these newly induced conspiracy beliefs, and simply prompting GPT-4o to only use accurate information dramatically reduced its ability to increase conspiracy beliefs.

A critical and overlooked area is tool-calling, where the performance of models prompted in non-English languages like Arabic is poorly understood, especially since these models are often pretrained on predominantly English data. This paper addresses this critical gap by introducing the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating the tool-calling and agentic capabilities of LLMs in the Arabic language. Our work provides a standardized framework to measure the functional accuracy and robustness of models in Arabic agentic workflows. Our findings reveal a huge performance gap: when users interact in Arabic, tool-calling accuracy drops by an average of 5-10\\%, regardless of whether the tool descriptions themselves are in Arabic or English.

However, achieving strong performance across these domains with a single general-purpose model typically requires scaling to sizes that are prohibitively expensive to train and deploy. On the other hand, while smaller domain-specialized models are much more efficient, they struggle to generalize beyond their training distributions. To address this dilemma, we propose FusionRoute, a robust and effective token-level multi-LLM collaboration framework in which a lightweight router simultaneously (i) selects the most suitable expert at each decoding step and (ii) contributes a complementary logit that refines or corrects the selected expert's next-token distribution via logit addition. Unlike existing token-level collaboration methods that rely solely on fixed expert outputs, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that pure expert-only routing is fundamentally limited: unless strong global coverage assumptions hold, it cannot in general realize the optimal decoding policy. By augmenting expert selection with a trainable complementary generator, FusionRoute expands the effective policy class and enables recovery of optimal value functions under mild conditions. Empirically, across both Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families and diverse benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, and instruction following, FusionRoute outperforms both sequence- and token-level collaboration, model merging, and direct fine-tuning, while remaining competitive with domain experts on their respective tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Collaborative inference offers a promising solution by selectively allocating work between lightweight and large models, yet a fundamental challenge remains: determining when a reasoning step requires the capacity of a large model or the efficiency of a small model. Existing routing strategies either rely on local token probabilities or post-hoc verification, introducing significant inference overhead. In this work, we propose a novel perspective on step-wise collaboration: the difficulty of a reasoning step can be inferred from its very first token. Inspired by the \"Aha Moment\" phenomenon in LRMs, we show that the entropy of the initial token serves as a strong predictor of step difficulty. Building on this insight, we introduce GlimpRouter, a training-free step-wise collaboration framework. GlimpRouter employs a lightweight model to generate only the first token of each reasoning step and routes the step to a larger model only when the initial token entropy exceeds a threshold. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces inference latency while preserving accuracy.

We find the opposite: judges are consistent, but not with each other; they are consistent with themselves. Across 3,240 evaluations (9 judges x 120 unique video x pack items x 3 independent runs), inter-judge agreement is near-zero (Krippendorff's \u03b1 = 0.042). On two dimensions, judges disagree more than random noise would predict (\u03b1 < 0). Yet this disagreement isn't chaos; it's structured. A classifier identifies which judge produced an evaluation with 77.1% accuracy from rubric scores alone, rising to 89.9% with disposition features. Within model families, the signal is even stronger: GPT-4.1 and GPT-5.2 are distinguishable with 99.6% accuracy. We call this the reliability paradox: judges cannot agree on what constitutes quality, yet their disagreement patterns are so stable they function as fingerprints. Each judge implements a distinct, stable theory of quality: an \"evaluative disposition\" that shapes how it interprets any rubric. We characterize these dispositions along multiple axes: harshness/leniency, dimension emphasis, within-judge stability (ICC), and evidence behavior (receipt validity, semantic linkage via NLI, and shotgun index). The implication is stark: LLM judges are not interchangeable instruments measuring a shared construct. They are distinct measurement devices, each encoding its own implicit theory of quality. Averaging their scores produces a synthetic verdict that corresponds to no judge's actual values.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Token-based watermarking techniques can corrupt the reasoning flow by applying pseudo-random biases, while semantic-aware approaches improve quality but introduce significant latency or require auxiliary models. This paper introduces ReasonMark, a novel watermarking framework specifically designed for reasoning-intensive LLMs. Our approach decouples generation into an undisturbed Thinking Phase and a watermarked Answering Phase. We propose a Criticality Score to identify semantically pivotal tokens from the reasoning trace, which are distilled into a Principal Semantic Vector (PSV). The PSV then guides a semantically-adaptive mechanism that modulates watermark strength based on token-PSV alignment, ensuring robustness without compromising logical integrity. Extensive experiments show ReasonMark surpasses state-of-the-art methods by reducing text Perplexity by 0.35, increasing translation BLEU score by 0.164, and raising mathematical accuracy by 0.67 points. These advancements are achieved alongside a 0.34% higher watermark detection AUC and stronger robustness to attacks, all with a negligible increase in latency.

This controlled setting is motivated by the inaccessibility of real-world user preference data from dynamic production systems, and enables us to isolate and analyze feedback-driven bias evolution in a principled manner. We focus on two types of loops, including the typical retraining setting and the incremental fine-tuning setting, which is largely underexplored.

While world models possess this capability, they most often require action labels, that can be complex to obtain at scale. This motivates the learning of latent action models, that can learn an action space from videos alone. Our work addresses the problem of learning latent actions world models on in-the-wild videos, expanding the scope of existing works that focus on simple robotics simulations, video games, or manipulation data. While this allows us to capture richer actions, it also introduces challenges stemming from the video diversity, such as environmental noise, or the lack of a common embodiment across videos. To address some of the challenges, we discuss properties that actions should follow as well as relevant architectural choices and evaluations. We find that continuous, but constrained, latent actions are able to capture the complexity of actions from in-the-wild videos, something that the common vector quantization does not. We for example find that changes in the environment coming from agents, such as humans entering the room, can be transferred across videos. This highlights the capability of learning actions that are specific to in-the-wild videos. In the absence of a common embodiment across videos, we are mainly able to learn latent actions that become localized in space, relative to the camera. Nonetheless, we are able to train a controller that maps known actions to latent ones, allowing us to use latent actions as a universal interface and solve planning tasks with our world model with similar performance as action-conditioned baselines. Our analyses and experiments provide a step towards scaling latent action models to the real world.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
