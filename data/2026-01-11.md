Abstract: Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Medical MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in specialized medical tasks; however, research into their safety has lagged, posing potential risks for real-world deployment. In this paper, we first establish a multidimensional evaluation framework to systematically benchmark the safety of current SOTA Medical MLLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals pervasive vulnerabilities across both general and medical-specific safety dimensions in existing models, particularly highlighting their fragility against cross-modality jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, we find that the medical fine-tuning process frequently induces catastrophic forgetting of the model's original safety alignment. To address this challenge, we propose a novel "Parameter-Space Intervention" approach for efficient safety re-alignment. This method extracts intrinsic safety knowledge representations from original base models and concurrently injects them into the target model during the construction of medical capabilities. Additionally, we design a fine-grained parameter search algorithm to achieve an optimal trade-off between safety and medical performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly bolsters the safety guardrails of Medical MLLMs without relying on additional domain-specific safety data, while minimizing degradation to core medical performance.

TL;DR: 提出一种受生物启发的能量感知推理框架，将蛋白质折叠能量景观映射到推理成本，通过衰减闭环阈值控制执行，仅在预期效用-能量权衡有利时才处理请求，显著减少处理时间且精度损失极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能部署中的能源效率是首要问题，长期运行的推理可能超过训练阶段的累积碳排放影响。传统方法通常关注模型精度优化，而忽视了推理过程中的能源消耗管理。

Method: 提出生物启发框架：将蛋白质折叠能量盆地映射到推理成本景观;使用衰减闭环阈值控制执行;仅在预期效用-能量权衡有利（高置信度/效用下边际能量和拥塞较低）时处理请求;偏向于首个可接受的局部盆地而非追求代价高昂的全局最小值。使用DistilBERT和ResNet-18，通过FastAPI与ONNX Runtime及NVIDIA Triton在RTX 4000 Ada GPU上评估。

Result: 生物控制器的消融研究显示，与标准开环执行相比，处理时间减少42%（在A100测试集上从0.50秒降至0.29秒），精度下降小于0.5%。建立了轻量级本地服务（ORT）与托管批处理（Triton）之间的效率边界。

Conclusion: 该研究将生物物理能量模型与绿色MLOps连接起来，为生产环境中的闭环能量感知推理提供了实用、可审计的基础。能够在保持较高精度的同时显著降低推理能耗，为实现可持续的AI部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: Energy efficiency is a first-order concern in AI deployment, as long-running inference can exceed training in cumulative carbon impact. We propose a bio-inspired framework that maps protein-folding energy basins to inference cost landscapes and controls execution via a decaying, closed-loop threshold. A request is admitted only when the expected utility-to-energy trade-off is favorable (high confidence/utility at low marginal energy and congestion), biasing operation toward the first acceptable local basin rather than pursuing costly global minima. We evaluate DistilBERT and ResNet-18 served through FastAPI with ONNX Runtime and NVIDIA Triton on an RTX 4000 Ada GPU. Our ablation study reveals that the bio-controller reduces processing time by 42% compared to standard open-loop execution (0.50s vs 0.29s on A100 test set), with a minimal accuracy degradation (<0.5%). Furthermore, we establish the efficiency boundaries between lightweight local serving (ORT) and managed batching (Triton). The results connect biophysical energy models to Green MLOps and offer a practical, auditable basis for closed-loop energy-aware inference in production.

TL;DR: CAST框架通过注意力头级别的诊断与稀疏微调，缓解LLM安全对齐中的多目标优化冲突，减少泛化能力下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法采用全局梯度几何解决多目标优化冲突，但忽视了Transformer中不同注意力头的功能敏感度和冲突程度的模块异质性，导致不均衡的参数更新和次优的性能权衡。

Method: 提出Conflict-Aware Sparse Tuning（CAST）框架：1）通过综合优化冲突和功能敏感性构建预对齐冲突图；2）基于该图选择性跳过高冲突注意力头的参数更新，进行稀疏微调。

Result: 实验发现LLM中的对齐冲突分布不均，泛化能力下降主要源于更新少数高冲突头。通过跳过这些头的训练，能显著减少能力损失而不影响安全性，实现了更好的安全-效用权衡。

Conclusion: CAST是一种可解释且参数高效的方法，通过识别和处理模块异质性，改进了LLM安全对齐中的性能权衡，为缓解多目标优化冲突提供了新思路。

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently presents a multi-objective optimization conflict, often accompanied by an unintended degradation of general capabilities. Existing mitigation strategies typically rely on global gradient geometry to resolve these conflicts, yet they overlook Modular Heterogeneity within Transformers, specifically that the functional sensitivity and degree of conflict vary substantially across different attention heads. Such global approaches impose uniform update rules across all parameters, often resulting in suboptimal trade-offs by indiscriminately updating utility sensitive heads that exhibit intense gradient conflicts. To address this limitation, we propose Conflict-Aware Sparse Tuning (CAST), a framework that integrates head-level diagnosis with sparse fine-tuning. CAST first constructs a pre-alignment conflict map by synthesizing Optimization Conflict and Functional Sensitivity, which then guides the selective update of parameters. Experiments reveal that alignment conflicts in LLMs are not uniformly distributed. We find that the drop in general capabilities mainly comes from updating a small group of ``high-conflict'' heads. By simply skipping these heads during training, we significantly reduce this loss without compromising safety, offering an interpretable and parameter-efficient approach to improving the safety-utility trade-off.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation has proven effective for model compression by transferring knowledge from a larger network called the teacher to a smaller network called the student. Current knowledge distillation in time series is predominantly based on logit and feature aligning techniques originally developed for computer vision tasks. These methods do not explicitly account for temporal data and fall short in two key aspects. First, the mechanisms by which the transferred knowledge helps the student model learning process remain unclear due to uninterpretability of logits and features. Second, these methods transfer only limited knowledge, primarily replicating the teacher predictive accuracy. As a result, student models often produce predictive distributions that differ significantly from those of their teachers, hindering their safe substitution for teacher models. In this work, we propose transferring interpretable knowledge by extending conventional logit transfer to convey not just the right prediction but also the right reasoning of the teacher. Specifically, we induce other useful knowledge from the teacher logits termed temporal saliency which captures the importance of each input timestep to the teacher prediction. By training the student with Temporal Saliency Distillation we encourage it to make predictions based on the same input features as the teacher. Temporal Saliency Distillation requires no additional parameters or architecture specific assumptions. We demonstrate that Temporal Saliency Distillation effectively improves the performance of baseline methods while also achieving desirable properties beyond predictive accuracy. We hope our work establishes a new paradigm for interpretable knowledge distillation in time series analysis.

### [5] [Online Action-Stacking Improves Reinforcement Learning Performance for Air Traffic Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04287)
*Ben Carvell,George De Ath,Eseoghene Benjamin,Richard Everson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出在线动作堆叠方法，作为强化学习策略的推理时包装器，可将训练中使用的小规模离散动作空间转换为符合空中交通管制需求的复合指令，在BluebirdDT数字孪生平台上验证了其在航路导航、高度层管理和防撞控制中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准强化学习算法通常使用简单的离散动作空间进行训练，但空中交通管制需要发出符合领域惯例的复合指令（如'转向航向250，爬升至高度层350'），二者之间存在显著差距。现有方法要么训练复杂的动作空间（高维难优化），要么使用简单动作（无法满足实际需求），因此需要一种能兼顾训练效率和操作适用性的方法。

Method: 1) 策略训练：使用PPO算法，基于5个基础动作（航向/高度增量调整）训练策略，加入动作阻尼惩罚减少指令频率，使智能体以短时爆发方式发出指令。2) 推理时在线动作堆叠：实时将连续的基础动作序列编译为符合ATC惯例的复合指令，如将连续的航向调整合并为单个转向指令。

Result: 在横向导航实验中：（1）相比基础阻尼方法，动作堆叠显著减少了指令数量；（2）仅使用5个动作的堆叠策略，其性能与使用37维动作空间的策略相当，证明能用更简单的动作空间达到复杂动作空间的效果。（3）系统成功实现了航路跟踪、高度层管理和两机防撞控制，满足最小间隔要求。

Conclusion: 在线动作堆叠有效弥合了标准强化学习范式与空中交通管制操作需求之间的关键差距，为扩展到更复杂控制场景提供了简单机制，使训练可在简单动作空间进行同时生成符合领域要求的复合指令。

Abstract: We introduce online action-stacking, an inference-time wrapper for reinforcement learning policies that produces realistic air traffic control commands while allowing training on a much smaller discrete action space. Policies are trained with simple incremental heading or level adjustments, together with an action-damping penalty that reduces instruction frequency and leads agents to issue commands in short bursts. At inference, online action-stacking compiles these bursts of primitive actions into domain-appropriate compound clearances. Using Proximal Policy Optimisation and the BluebirdDT digital twin platform, we train agents to navigate aircraft along lateral routes, manage climb and descent to target flight levels, and perform two-aircraft collision avoidance under a minimum separation constraint. In our lateral navigation experiments, action stacking greatly reduces the number of issued instructions relative to a damped baseline and achieves comparable performance to a policy trained with a 37-dimensional action space, despite operating with only five actions. These results indicate that online action-stacking helps bridge a key gap between standard reinforcement learning formulations and operational ATC requirements, and provides a simple mechanism for scaling to more complex control scenarios.

Abstract: Deep learning models, particularly recurrent neural networks and their variants, such as long short-term memory, have significantly advanced time series data analysis. These models capture complex, sequential patterns in time series, enabling real-time assessments. However, their high computational complexity and large model sizes pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as wearable devices and edge computing platforms. Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from a large, complex model (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient model (student), thereby retaining high performance while reducing computational demands. Current KD methods, originally designed for computer vision tasks, neglect the unique temporal dependencies and memory retention characteristics of time series models. To this end, we propose a novel KD framework termed Memory-Discrepancy Knowledge Distillation (MemKD). MemKD leverages a specialized loss function to capture memory retention discrepancies between the teacher and student models across subsequences within time series data, ensuring that the student model effectively mimics the teacher model's behaviour. This approach facilitates the development of compact, high-performing recurrent neural networks suitable for real-time, time series analysis tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MemKD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods. It reduces parameter size and memory usage by approximately 500 times while maintaining comparable performance to the teacher model.

Abstract: Weather and climate models rely on parametrisations to represent unresolved sub-grid processes. Traditional schemes rely on fixed coefficients that are weakly constrained and tuned offline, contributing to persistent biases that limit their ability to adapt to the underlying physics. This study presents a framework that learns components of parametrisation schemes online as a function of the evolving model state using reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluates the resulting RL-driven parameter updates across a hierarchy of idealised testbeds spanning a simple climate bias correction (SCBC), a radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), and a zonal mean energy balance model (EBM) with both single-agent and federated multi-agent settings. Across nine RL algorithms, Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) achieved the highest skill and the most stable convergence across configurations, with performance assessed against a static baseline using area-weighted RMSE, temperature profile and pressure-level diagnostics. For the EBM, single-agent RL outperformed static parameter tuning with the strongest gains in tropical and mid-latitude bands, while federated RL on multi-agent setups enabled geographically specialised control and faster convergence, with a six-agent DDPG configuration using frequent aggregation yielding the lowest area-weighted RMSE across the tropics and mid-latitudes. The learnt corrections were also physically meaningful as agents modulated EBM radiative parameters to reduce meridional biases, adjusted RCE lapse rates to match vertical temperature errors, and stabilised SCBC heating increments to limit drift. Overall, results highlight RL to deliver skilful state-dependent, and regime-aware parametrisations, offering a scalable pathway for online learning within numerical models.

Abstract: Deep learning optimization exhibits structure that is not captured by worst-case gradient bounds. Empirically, gradients along training trajectories are often temporally predictable and evolve within a low-dimensional subspace. In this work we formalize this observation through a measurable framework for predictable gradient manifolds.
  We introduce two computable quantities: a prediction-based path length that measures how well gradients can be forecast from past information, and a predictable rank that quantifies the intrinsic temporal dimension of gradient increments. We show how classical online and nonconvex optimization guarantees can be restated so that convergence and regret depend explicitly on these quantities, rather than on worst-case variation.
  Across convolutional networks, vision transformers, language models, and synthetic control tasks, we find that gradient trajectories are locally predictable and exhibit strong low-rank structure over time. These properties are stable across architectures and optimizers, and can be diagnosed directly from logged gradients using lightweight random projections.
  Our results provide a unifying lens for understanding optimization dynamics in modern deep learning, reframing standard training as operating in a low-complexity temporal regime. This perspective suggests new directions for adaptive optimizers, rank-aware tracking, and prediction-based algorithm design grounded in measurable properties of real training runs.

Conclusion: 诊断出后训练模型校准错误的两种机制，并提出双重对齐框架解决问题，证明区分和处理这两种漂移对改善校准效果至关重要。

Abstract: Post-training improves large language models (LLMs) but often worsens confidence calibration, leading to systematic overconfidence. Recent unsupervised post-hoc methods for post-trained LMs (PoLMs) mitigate this by aligning PoLM confidence to that of well-calibrated pre-trained counterparts. However, framing calibration as static output-distribution matching overlooks the inference-time dynamics introduced by post-training. In particular, we show that calibration errors arise from two regimes: (i) confidence drift, where final confidence inflates despite largely consistent intermediate decision processes, and (ii) process drift, where intermediate inference pathways diverge. Guided by this diagnosis, we propose Dual-Align, an unsupervised post-hoc framework for dual alignment in confidence calibration. Dual-Align performs confidence alignment to correct confidence drift via final-distribution matching, and introduces process alignment to address process drift by locating the layer where trajectories diverge and realigning the stability of subsequent inference. This dual strategy learns a single temperature parameter that corrects both drift types without sacrificing post-training performance gains. Experiments show consistent improvements over baselines, reducing calibration errors and approaching a supervised oracle.

Abstract: The generation of synthetic data is receiving increasing attention from the scientific community, thanks to its ability to solve problems like data scarcity and privacy, and is starting to find applications in air transport. We here tackle the problem of generating synthetic, yet realistic, time series of delays at airports, starting from large collections of operations in Europe and the US. We specifically compare three models, two of them based on state of the art Deep Learning algorithms, and one simplified Genetic Algorithm approach. We show how the latter can generate time series that are almost indistinguishable from real ones, while maintaining a high variability. We further validate the resulting time series in a problem of detecting delay propagations between airports. We finally make the synthetic data available to the scientific community.

Abstract: Collaborative perception (CP) is a critical technology in applications like autonomous driving and smart cities. It involves the sharing and fusion of information among sensors to overcome the limitations of individual perception, such as blind spots and range limitations. However, CP faces two primary challenges. First, due to the dynamic nature of the environment, the timeliness of the transmitted information is critical to perception performance. Second, with limited computational power at the sensors and constrained wireless bandwidth, the communication volume must be carefully designed to ensure feature representations are both effective and sufficient. This work studies the dynamic scheduling problem in a multi-region CP scenario, and presents a Timeliness-Aware Multi-region Prioritized (TAMP) scheduling algorithm to trade-off perception accuracy and communication resource usage. Timeliness reflects the utility of information that decays as time elapses, which is manifested by the perception performance in CP tasks. We propose an empirical penalty function that maps the joint impact of Age of Information (AoI) and communication volume to perception performance. Aiming to minimize this timeliness-oriented penalty in the long-term, and recognizing that scheduling decisions have a cumulative effect on subsequent system states, we propose the TAMP scheduling algorithm. TAMP is a Lyapunov-based optimization policy that decomposes the long-term average objective into a per-slot prioritization problem, balancing the scheduling worth against resource cost. We validate our algorithm in both intersection and corridor scenarios with the real-world Roadside Cooperative perception (RCooper) dataset. Extensive simulations demonstrate that TAMP outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an Average Precision (AP) improvement of up to 27% across various configurations.

Abstract: Machine unlearning has become a crucial role in enabling generative models trained on large datasets to remove sensitive, private, or copyright-protected data. However, existing machine unlearning methods face three challenges in learning to forget identity of generative models: 1) inefficient, where identity erasure requires fine-tuning all the model's parameters; 2) limited controllability, where forgetting intensity cannot be controlled and explainability is lacking; 3) catastrophic collapse, where the model's retention capability undergoes drastic degradation as forgetting progresses. Forgetting has typically been handled through discrete and unstable updates, often requiring full-model fine-tuning and leading to catastrophic collapse. In this work, we argue that identity forgetting should be modeled as a continuous trajectory, and introduce LEGATO - Learn to ForgEt Identity in GenerAtive Models via Trajectory-consistent Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. LEGATO augments pre-trained generators with fine-tunable lightweight Neural ODE adapters, enabling smooth, controllable forgetting while keeping the original model weights frozen. This formulation allows forgetting intensity to be precisely modulated via ODE step size, offering interpretability and robustness. To further ensure stability, we introduce trajectory consistency constraints that explicitly prevent catastrophic collapse during unlearning. Extensive experiments across in-domain and out-of-domain identity unlearning benchmarks show that LEGATO achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance, avoids catastrophic collapse and reduces fine-tuned parameters.

Conclusion: MQ-GNN通过创新的流水线设计、异步一致性机制和采样优化，为多GPU GNN训练提供了高效可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了训练效率和资源利用率

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning graph-structured data, but their scalability is hindered by inefficient mini-batch generation, data transfer bottlenecks, and costly inter-GPU synchronization. Existing training frameworks fail to overlap these stages, leading to suboptimal resource utilization. This paper proposes MQ-GNN, a multi-queue pipelined framework that maximizes training efficiency by interleaving GNN training stages and optimizing resource utilization. MQ-GNN introduces Ready-to-Update Asynchronous Consistent Model (RaCoM), which enables asynchronous gradient sharing and model updates while ensuring global consistency through adaptive periodic synchronization. Additionally, it employs global neighbor sampling with caching to reduce data transfer overhead and an adaptive queue-sizing strategy to balance computation and memory efficiency. Experiments on four large-scale datasets and ten baseline models demonstrate that MQ-GNN achieves up to \boldmath $\bm{4.6\,\times}$ faster training time and 30% improved GPU utilization while maintaining competitive accuracy. These results establish MQ-GNN as a scalable and efficient solution for multi-GPU GNN training.

Abstract: Building on insights from the grokking literature, we study character-level Transformers trained to compute modular addition from text, and focus on robustness under input-format variation rather than only in-distribution accuracy. We identify a previously under-emphasized failure mode: models that achieve high in-distribution accuracy can fail catastrophically when the same expression is shifted to different absolute character positions ("position shift") or presented under out-of-distribution natural-language templates. Using a disjoint-pair split over all ordered pairs for p=97, we show that a baseline model reaches strong in-distribution performance yet collapses under position shift and template OOD. We then introduce a simple training recipe that combines (i) explicit expression boundary markers, (ii) position curriculum that broadens the range of absolute positions seen during training, (iii) diverse template mixtures, and (iv) consistency training across multiple variants per example. Across three seeds, this intervention substantially improves robustness to position shift and template OOD while maintaining high in-distribution accuracy, whereas an ALiBi-style ablation fails to learn the task under our setup. Our results suggest that steering procedural generalization under noisy supervision benefits from explicitly training invariances that are otherwise absent from the data distribution, and we provide a reproducible evaluation protocol and artifacts.

Abstract: Objective: Stroke is one of the leading causes of disabilities. One promising approach is to extend the rehabilitation with self-initiated robot-assisted movement therapy. To enable this, it is required to detect the patient's intention to move to trigger the assistance of a robotic device. This intention to move can be detected from human surface electroencephalography (EEG) signals; however, it is particularly challenging to decode when classifications are performed online and asynchronously. In this work, the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing technique was investigated to enhance the robustness of such asynchronous classification. Approach: To investigate the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing, two EEG datasets with 14 healthy subjects who performed self-initiated arm movements were analyzed. Offline and pseudo-online evaluations were conducted to compare ensemble combinations of the support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and EEGNet classification models. Results: The results of the pseudo-online evaluation show that the two model ensembles significantly outperformed the best single model for the optimal number of postprocessing windows. In particular, for single models, an increased number of postprocessing windows significantly improved classification performances. Interestingly, we found no significant improvements between performances of the best single model and classifier ensembles in the offline evaluation. Significance: We demonstrated that classifier ensembles and appropriate postprocessing methods effectively enhance the asynchronous detection of movement intentions from EEG signals. In particular, the classifier ensemble approach yields greater improvements in online classification than in offline classification, and reduces false detections, i.e., early false positives.

Abstract: The objective assessment of human affective and psychological states presents a significant challenge, particularly through non-verbal channels. This paper introduces digital drawing as a rich and underexplored modality for affective sensing. We present a novel multimodal framework, named ArtCognition, for the automated analysis of the House-Tree-Person (HTP) test, a widely used psychological instrument. ArtCognition uniquely fuses two distinct data streams: static visual features from the final artwork, captured by computer vision models, and dynamic behavioral kinematic cues derived from the drawing process itself, such as stroke speed, pauses, and smoothness. To bridge the gap between low-level features and high-level psychological interpretation, we employ a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. This grounds the analysis in established psychological knowledge, enhancing explainability and reducing the potential for model hallucination. Our results demonstrate that the fusion of visual and behavioral kinematic cues provides a more nuanced assessment than either modality alone. We show significant correlations between the extracted multimodal features and standardized psychological metrics, validating the framework's potential as a scalable tool to support clinicians.

TL;DR: 该研究为1型糖尿病提出了一种可解释的深度学习框架，整合连续血糖监测和实验室数据，通过多模态时态嵌入识别五种代谢表型，显示其与临床结局的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 1型糖尿病具有高度代谢异质性，传统生物标志物如糖化血红蛋白无法充分表征。需要新的方法来区分不同代谢表型并支持风险分层。

Method: 提出可解释深度学习框架：1）整合CGM数据和实验室指标；2）使用Transformer编码器建模跨模态时间依赖；3）通过高斯混合模型识别潜在代谢表型；4）通过Transformer注意力可视化和SHAP特征归因实现可解释性。

Result: 1）在577名1型糖尿病患者中识别出五种代谢表型（从代谢稳定到心血管代谢风险升高）；2）表型在血糖控制、脂质代谢、肾功能标志物和促甲状腺激素水平方面有显著差异；3）注意力和SHAP分析分别识别出血糖变异性、HbA1c、甘油三酯、胆固醇、肌酐和TSH为关键贡献因素；4）表型成员资格与高血压、心肌梗死和心力衰竭有显著（但相关性适中）的关联。

Conclusion: 该可解释多模态时间嵌入框架揭示了1型糖尿病中生理学上一致的代谢亚组，支持超越单一生物标志物的风险分层，为精准医学提供潜在工具。

Abstract: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a highly metabolically heterogeneous disease that cannot be adequately characterized by conventional biomarkers such as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). This study proposes an explainable deep learning framework that integrates continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data with laboratory profiles to learn multimodal temporal embeddings of individual metabolic status. Temporal dependencies across modalities are modeled using a transformer encoder, while latent metabolic phenotypes are identified via Gaussian mixture modeling. Model interpretability is achieved through transformer attention visualization and SHAP-based feature attribution. Five latent metabolic phenotypes, ranging from metabolic stability to elevated cardiometabolic risk, were identified among 577 individuals with T1D. These phenotypes exhibit distinct biochemical profiles, including differences in glycemic control, lipid metabolism, renal markers, and thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Attention analysis highlights glucose variability as a dominant temporal factor, while SHAP analysis identifies HbA1c, triglycerides, cholesterol, creatinine, and TSH as key contributors to phenotype differentiation. Phenotype membership shows statistically significant, albeit modest, associations with hypertension, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Overall, this explainable multimodal temporal embedding framework reveals physiologically coherent metabolic subgroups in T1D and supports risk stratification beyond single biomarkers.

Motivation: 前沿AI系统在网页规模数据上预训练时，测试集污染已成为准确评估其能力的关键问题。现有研究主要关注判别式评估（如选择题）中的污染影响，而对生成式评估中污染影响的研究相对缺乏。

Method: 在MATH基准测试上预训练语言模型，系统控制模型大小和测试集副本污染量；使用缩放定律分析污染效应；研究不同微调策略（新鲜数据过度训练、监督微调）对污染效应的调节；分析推理阶段温度参数和生成长度对记忆的影响。

Result: 性能随污染量和模型大小增加而提升；即使单个测试集副本也能使模型损失低于无污染不可降低误差；过度训练可减轻污染效应；监督微调效果取决于预训练污染量；高温采样缓解污染效应；长文本比短文本指数级更难记忆。

Conclusion: 通过描述生成与记忆的相互作用，本研究揭示了AI系统可信评估的新复杂性层次，表明生成式评估中的测试集污染机制与判别式评估存在本质差异。

Abstract: As frontier AI systems are pretrained on web-scale data, test set contamination has become a critical concern for accurately assessing their capabilities. While research has thoroughly investigated the impact of test set contamination on discriminative evaluations like multiple-choice question-answering, comparatively little research has studied the impact of test set contamination on generative evaluations. In this work, we quantitatively assess the effect of test set contamination on generative evaluations through the language model lifecycle. We pretrain language models on mixtures of web data and the MATH benchmark, sweeping model sizes and number of test set replicas contaminating the pretraining corpus; performance improves with contamination and model size. Using scaling laws, we make a surprising discovery: including even a single test set replica enables models to achieve lower loss than the irreducible error of training on the uncontaminated corpus. We then study further training: overtraining with fresh data reduces the effects of contamination, whereas supervised finetuning on the training set can either increase or decrease performance on test data, depending on the amount of pretraining contamination. Finally, at inference, we identify factors that modulate memorization: high sampling temperatures mitigate contamination effects, and longer solutions are exponentially more difficult to memorize than shorter ones, presenting a contrast with discriminative evaluations, where solutions are only a few tokens in length. By characterizing how generation and memorization interact, we highlight a new layer of complexity for trustworthy evaluation of AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在因果系统的领域适配中，目标变量时常在目标域中完全缺失，仅能从其他观测变量中进行推断。传统方法难以应对各种分布偏移，且在高维因果模型中缺乏轻量级统一工具。本文旨在开发一种能够学习机制稳定表示的方法，保留预测目标变量的相关信息同时剔除虚假变异，实现零样本域适应的准确插补。

Method: 对于线性高斯因果模型，推导出闭式高斯信息瓶颈（GIB）解，该解可简化为典型相关分析（CCA）式投影，并可根据需要提供有向无环图（DAG）感知选项。对于非线性或非高斯数据，引入了变分信息瓶颈（VIB）编码器-预测器方法，该方法可扩展到高维数据，训练于源域数据并可零样本部署到目标域。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在各种分布偏移下均能实现准确的目标变量插补，支持在高维因果模型中的实际应用，并提供了一个统一的轻量级因果领域适配工具包。

Conclusion: 本文提出的机制稳定表示学习方法为因果系统中的领域适配问题提供了有效解决方案，特别是针对目标变量在目标域中缺失的场景。所推导的闭式解和变分方法分别适用于线性和非线性设置，形成了全面且实用的工具包，在合成和真实数据中均验证了其准确性和可扩展性。

Abstract: We tackle a common domain adaptation setting in causal systems. In this setting, the target variable is observed in the source domain but is entirely missing in the target domain. We aim to impute the target variable in the target domain from the remaining observed variables under various shifts. We frame this as learning a compact, mechanism-stable representation. This representation preserves information relevant for predicting the target while discarding spurious variation. For linear Gaussian causal models, we derive a closed-form Gaussian Information Bottleneck (GIB) solution. This solution reduces to a canonical correlation analysis (CCA)-style projection and offers Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-aware options when desired. For nonlinear or non-Gaussian data, we introduce a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) encoder-predictor. This approach scales to high dimensions and can be trained on source data and deployed zero-shot to the target domain. Across synthetic and real datasets, our approach consistently attains accurate imputations, supporting practical use in high-dimensional causal models and furnishing a unified, lightweight toolkit for causal domain adaptation.

Abstract: In evolutionary reinforcement learning tasks (ERL), agent policies are often encoded as small artificial neural networks (NERL). Such representations lack explicit modular structure, limiting behavioral interpretation. We investigate whether programmatic policies (PERL), implemented as soft, differentiable decision lists (SDDL), can match the performance of NERL. To support reproducible evaluation, we provide the first fully specified and open-source reimplementation of the classic 1992 Artificial Life (ALife) ERL testbed. We conduct a rigorous survival analysis across 4000 independent trials utilizing Kaplan-Meier curves and Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) metrics absent in the original study. We find a statistically significant difference in survival probability between PERL and NERL. PERL agents survive on average 201.69 steps longer than NERL agents. Moreover, SDDL agents using learning alone (no evolution) survive on average 73.67 steps longer than neural agents using both learning and evaluation. These results demonstrate that programmatic policies can exceed the survival performance of neural policies in ALife.

Abstract: This paper introduces a fuzzy reinforcement learning framework, Enhanced-FQL($λ$), that integrates novel Fuzzified Eligibility Traces (FET) and Segmented Experience Replay (SER) into fuzzy Q-learning with Fuzzified Bellman Equation (FBE) for continuous control tasks. The proposed approach employs an interpretable fuzzy rule base instead of complex neural architectures, while maintaining competitive performance through two key innovations: a fuzzified Bellman equation with eligibility traces for stable multi-step credit assignment, and a memory-efficient segment-based experience replay mechanism for enhanced sample efficiency. Theoretical analysis proves the proposed method convergence under standard assumptions. Extensive evaluations in continuous control domains demonstrate that Enhanced-FQL($λ$) achieves superior sample efficiency and reduced variance compared to n-step fuzzy TD and fuzzy SARSA($λ$) baselines, while maintaining substantially lower computational complexity than deep RL alternatives such as DDPG. The framework's inherent interpretability, combined with its computational efficiency and theoretical convergence guarantees, makes it particularly suitable for safety-critical applications where transparency and resource constraints are essential.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a simple but powerful paradigm for training LLMs: sample a completion, verify it, and update. In practice, however, the verifier is almost never clean--unit tests probe only limited corner cases; human and synthetic labels are imperfect; and LLM judges (e.g., RLAIF) are noisy and can be exploited--and this problem worsens on harder domains (especially coding) where tests are sparse and increasingly model-generated. We ask a pragmatic question: does the verification noise merely slow down the learning (rate), or can it flip the outcome (fate)?
  To address this, we develop an analytically tractable multi-armed bandit view of RLVR dynamics, instantiated with GRPO and validated in controlled experiments. Modeling false positives and false negatives and grouping completions into recurring reasoning modes yields a replicator-style (natural-selection) flow on the probability simplex. The dynamics decouples into within-correct-mode competition and a one-dimensional evolution for the mass on incorrect modes, whose drift is determined solely by Youden's index J=TPR-FPR. This yields a sharp phase transition: when J>0, the incorrect mass is driven toward extinction (learning); when J=0, the process is neutral; and when J<0, incorrect modes amplify until they dominate (anti-learning and collapse). In the learning regime J>0, noise primarily rescales convergence time ("rate, not fate"). Experiments on verifiable programming tasks under synthetic noise reproduce the predicted J=0 boundary. Beyond noise, the framework offers a general lens for analyzing RLVR stability, convergence, and algorithmic interventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量子机器遗忘研究主要依赖固定的均匀目标分布，缺乏对遗忘与保留模型行为平衡的显式控制。需要一种更可控、可解释的遗忘框架来精确抑制被遗忘类别置信度，同时最小化对保留类别性能的影响。

Method: 提出了分布引导的量子机器遗忘框架，将遗忘视为带约束的优化问题。核心创新包括：(1) 基于模型相似度统计的可调目标分布，解耦被遗忘类别置信度抑制与保留类别之间的再分布假设；(2) 锚点保护约束，通过在选定保留数据上保持预测行为来限制对原始模型的偏离；(3) 在Iris和Covertype数据集上训练变分量子分类器进行验证。

Result: 评估结果表明，该方法能够：(1) 显著抑制被遗忘类别置信度；(2) 对保留类别性能的影响最小；(3) 与完全重训练的基线模型对齐程度更高，优于传统均匀目标遗忘方法。

Conclusion: 研究强调了目标分布设计和基于约束的优化公式对实现可靠、可解释量子机器遗忘的重要性。提出的框架在精确控制遗忘过程的同时，有效平衡了遗忘效率与模型性能保留。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training data from a learned model without full retraining. While recent work has begun to explore unlearning in quantum machine learning, existing approaches largely rely on fixed, uniform target distributions and do not explicitly control the trade-off between forgetting and retained model behaviour. In this work, we propose a distribution-guided framework for class-level quantum machine unlearning that treats unlearning as a constrained optimization problem. Our method introduces a tunable target distribution derived from model similarity statistics, decoupling the suppression of forgotten-class confidence from assumptions about redistribution among retained classes. We further incorporate an anchor-based preservation constraint that explicitly maintains predictive behaviour on selected retained data, yielding a controlled optimization trajectory that limits deviation from the original model. We evaluate the approach on variational quantum classifiers trained on the Iris and Covertype datasets. Results demonstrate sharp suppression of forgotten-class confidence, minimal degradation of retained-class performance, and closer alignment with the gold retrained model baselines compared to uniform-target unlearning. These findings highlight the importance of target design and constraint-based formulations for reliable and interpretable quantum machine unlearning.

Motivation: 机器学习模型在高风险领域部署时，其预测结果会主动塑造环境（表演性预测现象），可能导致反馈循环、性能问题和重大社会风险。现有研究缺乏将这一现象概念系统化并提供实践指导的综合梳理

Method: 采用知识系统化方法，对表演性预测相关文献进行全面综述：剖析表演性的主要表现机制、建立相关风险类型学、梳理文献中提出的解决方案，并开发了"表演性强度-影响矩阵"评估框架

Conclusion: 此项SoK研究填补了表演性预测领域的知识系统化空白，为理解和解决模型部署中的表演性现象提供了结构化的概念框架和实践指导工具，帮助缓解由此产生的意外后果和社会风险

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly used in high-stakes domains where their predictions can actively shape the environments in which they operate, a phenomenon known as performative prediction. This dynamic, in which the deployment of the model influences the very outcome it seeks to predict, can lead to unintended consequences, including feedback loops, performance issues, and significant societal risks. While the literature in the field has grown rapidly in recent years, a socio-technical synthesis that systemises the phenomenon concepts and provides practical guidance has been lacking. This Systematisation of Knowledge (SoK) addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of the literature on performative predictions. We provide an overview of the primary mechanisms through which performativity manifests, present a typology of associated risks, and survey the proposed solutions offered in the literature. Our primary contribution is the ``Performative Strength vs. Impact Matrix" assessment framework. This practical tool is designed to help practitioners assess the potential influence and severity of performativity on their deployed predictive models and select the appropriate level of algorithmic or human intervention.

Abstract: Prolonged length of stay (pLoS) is a significant factor associated with the risk of adverse in-hospital events. We develop and explain a predictive model for pLos using admission-level patient and hospital administrative data. The approach includes a feature selection method by selecting non-correlated features with the highest information value. The method uses features weights of evidence to select a representative within cliques from graph theory. The prognosis study analyzed the records from 120,354 hospital admissions at the Hospital Alma Mater de Antioquia between January 2017 and March 2022. After a cleaning process the dataset was split into training (67%), test (22%), and validation (11%) cohorts. A logistic regression model was trained to predict the pLoS in two classes: less than or greater than 7 days. The performance of the model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC-ROC metrics. The feature selection method returns nine interpretable variables, enhancing the models' transparency. In the validation cohort, the pLoS model achieved a specificity of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.82-0.84), sensitivity of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.62-0.65), accuracy of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.76-0.77), precision of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.66-0.69), and AUC-ROC of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.81-0.83). The model exhibits strong predictive performance and offers insights into the factors that influence prolonged hospital stays. This makes it a valuable tool for hospital management and for developing future intervention studies aimed at reducing pLoS.

Abstract: The field of learning analytics has made notable strides in automating the detection of complex learning processes in multimodal data. However, most advancements have focused on individualized problem-solving instead of collaborative, open-ended problem-solving, which may offer both affordances (richer data) and challenges (low cohesion) to behavioral prediction. Here, we extend predictive models to automatically detect socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) behaviors in collaborative computational modeling environments using embedding-based approaches. We leverage large language models (LLMs) as summarization tools to generate task-aware representations of student dialogue aligned with system logs. These summaries, combined with text-only embeddings, context-enriched embeddings, and log-derived features, were used to train predictive models. Results show that text-only embeddings often achieve stronger performance in detecting SSRL behaviors related to enactment or group dynamics (e.g., off-task behavior or requesting assistance). In contrast, contextual and multimodal features provide complementary benefits for constructs such as planning and reflection. Overall, our findings highlight the promise of embedding-based models for extending learning analytics by enabling scalable detection of SSRL behaviors, ultimately supporting real-time feedback and adaptive scaffolding in collaborative learning environments that teachers value.

Abstract: Language models can perceive visual properties of text despite receiving only sequences of tokens-we mechanistically investigate how Claude 3.5 Haiku accomplishes one such task: linebreaking in fixed-width text. We find that character counts are represented on low-dimensional curved manifolds discretized by sparse feature families, analogous to biological place cells. Accurate predictions emerge from a sequence of geometric transformations: token lengths are accumulated into character count manifolds, attention heads twist these manifolds to estimate distance to the line boundary, and the decision to break the line is enabled by arranging estimates orthogonally to create a linear decision boundary. We validate our findings through causal interventions and discover visual illusions--character sequences that hijack the counting mechanism. Our work demonstrates the rich sensory processing of early layers, the intricacy of attention algorithms, and the importance of combining feature-based and geometric views of interpretability.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) and federated distillation (FD) are distributed learning paradigms that train UE models with enhanced privacy, each offering different trade-offs between noise robustness and learning speed. To mitigate their respective weaknesses, we propose a hybrid federated learning (HFL) framework in which each user equipment (UE) transmits either gradients or logits, and the base station (BS) selects the per-round weights of FL and FD updates. We derive convergence of HFL framework and introduce two methods to exploit degrees of freedom (DoF) in HFL, which are (i) adaptive UE clustering via Jenks optimization and (ii) adaptive weight selection via a damped Newton method. Numerical results show that HFL achieves superior test accuracy at low SNR when both DoF are exploited.

Motivation: 尽管现有文本到图像（T2I）模型能生成美观图片，但其在生成信息图时的可靠性尚不明确。生成的信息图可能存在易被忽略的数据编码扭曲或文本内容错误等隐蔽问题，需要系统评估框架。

Method: 开发 IGENBENCH 基准测试（600 个测试案例覆盖 30 种信息图类型），设计自动化评估框架将可靠性验证分解为基于 10 类问题的原子是/否问题，采用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）验证每个问题，计算问题级准确率（Q-ACC）和信息图级准确率（I-ACC）。

Abstract: Infographics are composite visual artifacts that combine data visualizations with textual and illustrative elements to communicate information. While recent text-to-image (T2I) models can generate aesthetically appealing images, their reliability in generating infographics remains unclear. Generated infographics may appear correct at first glance but contain easily overlooked issues, such as distorted data encoding or incorrect textual content. We present IGENBENCH, the first benchmark for evaluating the reliability of text-to-infographic generation, comprising 600 curated test cases spanning 30 infographic types. We design an automated evaluation framework that decomposes reliability verification into atomic yes/no questions based on a taxonomy of 10 question types. We employ multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to verify each question, yielding question-level accuracy (Q-ACC) and infographic-level accuracy (I-ACC). We comprehensively evaluate 10 state-of-the-art T2I models on IGENBENCH. Our systematic analysis reveals key insights for future model development: (i) a three-tier performance hierarchy with the top model achieving Q-ACC of 0.90 but I-ACC of only 0.49; (ii) data-related dimensions emerging as universal bottlenecks (e.g., Data Completeness: 0.21); and (iii) the challenge of achieving end-to-end correctness across all models.

Abstract: Therapeutic peptides show promise in targeting previously undruggable binding sites, with recent advancements in deep generative models enabling full-atom peptide co-design for specific protein receptors. However, the critical role of molecular surfaces in protein-protein interactions (PPIs) has been underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an omni-design peptides generation paradigm, called SurfFlow, a novel surface-based generative algorithm that enables comprehensive co-design of sequence, structure, and surface for peptides. SurfFlow employs a multi-modality conditional flow matching (CFM) architecture to learn distributions of surface geometries and biochemical properties, enhancing peptide binding accuracy. Evaluated on the comprehensive PepMerge benchmark, SurfFlow consistently outperforms full-atom baselines across all metrics.

TL;DR: 论文观察到在RLVR训练过程中，大语言模型的权重和输出对数概率呈现强烈的线性演进特征，提出通过权重外推和逻辑外推两种方法，显著减少训练计算量同时获得可比甚至更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR训练虽然有效，但需要数千步计算密集型优化，主要时间消耗在探索过程。研究发现模型演进呈现强烈线性特征，启示了通过外推预测未来模型状态以减少训练计算的潜力。

Method: 基于模型演进的线性观察，提出两种外推方法：权重外推直接从中间检查点外推模型参数；逻辑外推在外推空间中使用检查点模型对候选响应进行重新排序。

Result: 权重外推获得的模型性能与标准RL训练相当，但计算量显著减少；逻辑外推在四个基准测试上一致优于继续RL训练，特别是能够稳定地外推到RL训练失效的步数范围。

Conclusion: RLVR训练中的强大线性特性使得外推成为高效替代方案，能够在显著降低计算成本的同时保持或提升模型性能，为LLM后训练范式提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a central component of large language model (LLM) post-training. Unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT), RLVR lets an LLM generate multiple candidate solutions and reinforces those that lead to a verifiably correct final answer. However, in practice, RLVR often requires thousands of training steps to reach strong performance, incurring substantial computation largely attributed to prolonged exploration. In this work, we make a surprising observation: during RLVR, LLMs evolve in a strongly linear manner. Specifically, both model weights and model output log-probabilities exhibit strong linear correlations with RL training steps. This suggests that RLVR predominantly amplifies trends that emerge early in training, rather than continuously discovering new behaviors throughout the entire optimization trajectory. Motivated by this linearity, we investigate whether future model states can be predicted from intermediate checkpoints via extrapolation, avoiding continued expensive training. We show that Weight Extrapolation produces models with performance comparable to standard RL training while requiring significantly less computation. Moreover, Logits Extrapolation consistently outperforms continued RL training on all four benchmarks by extrapolating beyond the step range where RL training remains stable.

Abstract: Conventional semi-supervised contrastive learning methods assign pseudo-labels only to samples whose highest predicted class probability exceeds a predefined threshold, and then perform supervised contrastive learning using those selected samples. In this study, we propose a novel loss function that estimates the confidence of each sample based on the entropy of its predicted probability distribution and applies confidence-based adaptive weighting. This approach enables pseudo-label assignment even to samples that were previously excluded from training and facilitates contrastive learning that accounts for the confidence of both anchor and positive samples in a more principled manner. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves classification accuracy and achieves more stable learning performance even under low-label conditions.

Abstract: Our experience of the world is multisensory, spanning a synthesis of language, sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. Yet, artificial intelligence has primarily advanced in digital modalities like text, vision, and audio. This paper outlines a research vision for multisensory artificial intelligence over the next decade. This new set of technologies can change how humans and AI experience and interact with one another, by connecting AI to the human senses and a rich spectrum of signals from physiological and tactile cues on the body, to physical and social signals in homes, cities, and the environment. We outline how this field must advance through three interrelated themes of sensing, science, and synergy. Firstly, research in sensing should extend how AI captures the world in richer ways beyond the digital medium. Secondly, developing a principled science for quantifying multimodal heterogeneity and interactions, developing unified modeling architectures and representations, and understanding cross-modal transfer. Finally, we present new technical challenges to learn synergy between modalities and between humans and AI, covering multisensory integration, alignment, reasoning, generation, generalization, and experience. Accompanying this vision paper are a series of projects, resources, and demos of latest advances from the Multisensory Intelligence group at the MIT Media Lab, see https://mit-mi.github.io/.

Abstract: Imputing missing values in spatial-temporal traffic data is essential for intelligent transportation systems. Among advanced imputation methods, score-based diffusion models have demonstrated competitive performance. These models generate data by reversing a noising process, using observed values as conditional guidance. However, existing diffusion models typically apply a uniform guidance scale across both spatial and temporal dimensions, which is inadequate for nodes with high missing data rates. Sparse observations provide insufficient conditional guidance, causing the generative process to drift toward the learned prior distribution rather than closely following the conditional observations, resulting in suboptimal imputation performance.
  To address this, we propose FENCE, a spatial-temporal feedback diffusion guidance method designed to adaptively control guidance scales during imputation. First, FENCE introduces a dynamic feedback mechanism that adjusts the guidance scale based on the posterior likelihood approximations. The guidance scale is increased when generated values diverge from observations and reduced when alignment improves, preventing overcorrection. Second, because alignment to observations varies across nodes and denoising steps, a global guidance scale for all nodes is suboptimal. FENCE computes guidance scales at the cluster level by grouping nodes based on their attention scores, leveraging spatial-temporal correlations to provide more accurate guidance. Experimental results on real-world traffic datasets show that FENCE significantly enhances imputation accuracy.

Abstract: This paper introduces FedKDX, a federated learning framework that addresses limitations in healthcare AI through Negative Knowledge Distillation (NKD). Unlike existing approaches that focus solely on positive knowledge transfer, FedKDX captures both target and non-target information to improve model generalization in healthcare applications. The framework integrates multiple knowledge transfer techniques--including traditional knowledge distillation, contrastive learning, and NKD--within a unified architecture that maintains privacy while reducing communication costs. Through experiments on healthcare datasets (SLEEP, UCI-HAR, and PAMAP2), FedKDX demonstrates improved accuracy (up to 2.53% over state-of-the-art methods), faster convergence, and better performance on non-IID data distributions. Theoretical analysis supports NKD's contribution to addressing statistical heterogeneity in distributed healthcare data. The approach shows promise for privacy-sensitive medical applications under regulatory frameworks like HIPAA and GDPR, offering a balanced solution between performance and practical implementation requirements in decentralized healthcare settings.

Abstract: Classical Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) summarize musical context into a deterministic hidden state vector, imposing an information bottleneck that fails to capture the inherent ambiguity in music. We propose the Density Matrix RNN (DM-RNN), a novel theoretical architecture utilizing the Density Matrix. This allows the model to maintain a statistical ensemble of musical interpretations (a mixed state), capturing both classical probabilities and quantum coherences. We rigorously define the temporal dynamics using Quantum Channels (CPTP maps). Crucially, we detail a parameterization strategy based on the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism, ensuring the learned dynamics remain physically valid (CPTP) by construction. We introduce an analytical framework using Von Neumann Entropy to quantify musical uncertainty and Quantum Mutual Information (QMI) to measure entanglement between voices. The DM-RNN provides a mathematically rigorous framework for modeling complex, ambiguous musical structures.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training is a critical stage in modern language model development, playing a key role in improving alignment and reasoning ability. However, several phenomena remain poorly understood, including the reduction in output diversity. To gain a broader understanding of RL post-training, we analyze the learning dynamics of RL post-training from a perspective that has been studied in supervised learning but remains underexplored in RL. We adopt an empirical neural tangent kernel (NTK) framework and decompose the NTK into two components to characterize how RL updates propagate across training samples. Our analysis reveals that limited variability in feature representations can cause RL updates to systematically increase model confidence, providing an explanation for the commonly observed reduction in output diversity after RL post-training. Furthermore, we show that effective learning in this regime depends on rapidly shaping the classifier, which directly affects the gradient component of the NTK. Motivated by these insights, we propose classifier-first reinforcement learning (CF-RL), a simple two-stage training strategy that prioritizes classifier updates before standard RL optimization. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis by demonstrating increased model confidence and accelerated optimization under CF-RL. Additional analysis shows that the mechanism underlying CF-RL differs from that of linear-probing-then-fine-tuning in supervised learning. Overall, our study formalizes the learning dynamics of RL post-training and motivates further analysis and improvement.

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from observational data remains a fundamental challenge in causal inference, especially in the presence of latent confounders. This paper focuses on estimating causal effects in Gaussian Linear Structural Causal Models (GL-SCMs), which are widely used due to their analytical tractability. However, parameter estimation in GL-SCMs is often infeasible with finite data, primarily due to overparameterization. To address this, we introduce the class of Centralized Gaussian Linear SCMs (CGL-SCMs), a simplified yet expressive subclass where exogenous variables follow standardized distributions. We show that CGL-SCMs are equally expressive in terms of causal effect identifiability from observational distributions and present a novel EM-based estimation algorithm that can learn CGL-SCM parameters and estimate identifiable causal effects from finite observational samples. Our theoretical analysis is validated through experiments on synthetic data and benchmark causal graphs, demonstrating that the learned models accurately recover causal distributions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising recommendation systems, offering novel ways to model user preferences through generative approaches. However, many existing methods often rely solely on text semantics or incorporate collaborative signals in a limited manner, typically using only user or item embeddings. These methods struggle to handle multiple item embeddings representing user history, reverting to textual semantics and neglecting richer collaborative information. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective solution that projects user and item embeddings, learned from collaborative filtering, into the LLM token space via separate lightweight projector modules. A finetuned LLM then conditions on these projected embeddings alongside textual tokens to generate recommendations. Preliminary results show that this design effectively leverages structured user-item interaction data, improves recommendation performance over text-only LLM baselines, and offers a practical path for bridging traditional recommendation systems with modern LLMs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型推理时，KV Cache内存占用随序列长度线性增长，常常超过模型权重本身，成为内存瓶颈。需要高效压缩方案以降低内存压力。

Method: 开发了四种GPU加速的INT8量化CUDA内核：原生、分块、粗化和向量化版本，对KV Cache进行量化压缩，并在高达10亿元素的真实工作负载上进行了基准测试。

Result: 向量化内核比CPU基线加速1,694倍，重建误差低于0.004，注意力分数误差低于0.1（即使对于8K维头），仅增加6-58ms计算开销，内存减少4倍。

Conclusion: INT8量化为LLM推理中的内存压力提供了实用解决方案，在几乎不影响下游模型行为的前提下显著减少内存占用，计算开销可忽略。

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in large language models presents a significant memory bottleneck during inference, growing linearly with sequence length and often exceeding the memory footprint of model weights themselves. We implement and evaluate GPU-accelerated INT8 quantization for KV cache compression, achieving 4$\times$ memory reduction with minimal accuracy degradation. We develop four CUDA kernel variants -- naive, tiled, coarsened, and vectorized -- and benchmark them across realistic workload sizes up to 1 billion elements. Our vectorized kernel achieves up to 1,694$\times$ speedup over CPU baselines while maintaining reconstruction error below 0.004 and attention score error below 0.1 even for 8K-dimensional heads. These results demonstrate that INT8 quantization provides a practical approach for reducing memory pressure in LLM inference with negligible computational overhead (6--58ms) and minimal impact on downstream model behavior

Abstract: Understanding whether fine-tuning elicits latent capabilities or teaches new ones is a fundamental question for language model evaluation and safety. We develop a formal information-theoretic framework for quantifying how much predictive structure fine-tuning extracts from the train dataset and writes into a model's parameters. Our central quantity, Excess Description Length (EDL), is defined via prequential coding and measures the gap between the bits required to encode training labels sequentially using an evolving model (trained online) and the residual encoding cost under the final trained model. We establish that EDL is non-negative in expectation, converges to surplus description length in the infinite-data limit, and provides bounds on expected generalization gain. Through a series of toy models, we clarify common confusions about information in learning: why random labels yield EDL near zero, how a single example can eliminate many bits of uncertainty about the underlying rule(s) that describe the data distribution, why structure learned on rare inputs contributes proportionally little to expected generalization, and how format learning creates early transients distinct from capability acquisition. This framework provides rigorous foundations for the empirical observation that capability elicitation and teaching exhibit qualitatively distinct scaling signatures.

Abstract: Given real-time sensor data streams obtained from machines, how can we continuously predict when a machine failure will occur? This work aims to continuously forecast the timing of future events by analyzing multi-sensor data streams. A key characteristic of real-world data streams is their dynamic nature, where the underlying patterns evolve over time. To address this, we present TimeCast, a dynamic prediction framework designed to adapt to these changes and provide accurate, real-time predictions of future event time. Our proposed method has the following properties: (a) Dynamic: it identifies the distinct time-evolving patterns (i.e., stages) and learns individual models for each, enabling us to make adaptive predictions based on pattern shifts. (b) Practical: it finds meaningful stages that capture time-varying interdependencies between multiple sensors and improve prediction performance; (c) Scalable: our algorithm scales linearly with the input size and enables online model updates on data streams. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that TimeCast provides higher prediction accuracy than state-of-the-art methods while finding dynamic changes in data streams with a great reduction in computational time.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for spatiotemporal photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting and use it to evaluate the reliability, sharpness, and overall performance of seven intraday PV power nowcasting models. The model suite includes satellite-based deep learning and optical-flow approaches and physics-based numerical weather prediction models, covering both deterministic and probabilistic formulations. Forecasts are first validated against satellite-derived surface solar irradiance (SSI). Irradiance fields are then converted into PV power using station-specific machine learning models, enabling comparison with production data from 6434 PV stations across Switzerland. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate spatiotemporal PV forecasting at a national scale. We additionally provide the first visualizations of how mesoscale cloud systems shape national PV production on hourly and sub-hourly timescales. Our results show that satellite-based approaches outperform the Integrated Forecast System (IFS-ENS), particularly at short lead times. Among them, SolarSTEPS and SHADECast deliver the most accurate SSI and PV power predictions, with SHADECast providing the most reliable ensemble spread. The deterministic model IrradianceNet achieves the lowest root mean square error, while probabilistic forecasts of SolarSTEPS and SHADECast provide better-calibrated uncertainty. Forecast skill generally decreases with elevation. At a national scale, satellite-based models forecast the daily total PV generation with relative errors below 10% for 82% of the days in 2019-2020, demonstrating robustness and their potential for operational use.

Conclusion: AgentOCR通过视觉表示和缓存优化解决了文本历史膨胀问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升了效率和可扩展性，为LLM智能体部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable agentic systems trained with reinforcement learning (RL) over multi-turn interaction trajectories, but practical deployment is bottlenecked by rapidly growing textual histories that inflate token budgets and memory usage. We introduce AgentOCR, a framework that exploits the superior information density of visual tokens by representing the accumulated observation-action history as a compact rendered image. To make multi-turn rollouts scalable, AgentOCR proposes segment optical caching. By decomposing history into hashable segments and maintaining a visual cache, this mechanism eliminates redundant re-rendering. Beyond fixed rendering, AgentOCR introduces agentic self-compression, where the agent actively emits a compression rate and is trained with compression-aware reward to adaptively balance task success and token efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on challenging agentic benchmarks, ALFWorld and search-based QA. Remarkably, results demonstrate that AgentOCR preserves over 95\% of text-based agent performance while substantially reducing token consumption (>50\%), yielding consistent token and memory efficiency. Our further analysis validates a 20x rendering speedup from segment optical caching and the effective strategic balancing of self-compression.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in a wide range of tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, by exploiting the structural information in graph-structured data. However, in node classification, computing node-level explainability becomes extremely time-consuming as the size of the graph increases, while batching strategies often degrade explanation quality. This paper introduces a novel approach to parallelizing node-level explainability in GNNs through graph partitioning. By decomposing the graph into disjoint subgraphs, we enable parallel computation of explainability for node neighbors, significantly improving the scalability and efficiency without affecting the correctness of the results, provided sufficient memory is available. For scenarios where memory is limited, we further propose a dropout-based reconstruction mechanism that offers a controllable trade-off between memory usage and explanation fidelity. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial speedups, enabling scalable and transparent explainability for large-scale GNN models.

Abstract: Electrospinning is a scalable technique for producing fibrous scaffolds with tunable micro- and nanoscale architectures for applications in tissue engineering, drug delivery, and wound care. While machine learning (ML) has been used to support electrospinning process optimisation, most existing approaches predict only mean fibre diameters, neglecting the full diameter distribution that governs scaffold performance. This work presents FibreCastML, an open, distribution-aware ML framework that predicts complete fibre diameter spectra from routinely reported electrospinning parameters and provides interpretable insights into process structure relationships.
  A meta-dataset comprising 68538 individual fibre diameter measurements extracted from 1778 studies across 16 biomedical polymers was curated. Six standard processing parameters, namely solution concentration, applied voltage, flow rate, tip to collector distance, needle diameter, and collector rotation speed, were used to train seven ML models using nested cross validation with leave one study out external folds. Model interpretability was achieved using variable importance analysis, SHapley Additive exPlanations, correlation matrices, and three dimensional parameter maps.
  Non linear models consistently outperformed linear baselines, achieving coefficients of determination above 0.91 for several widely used polymers. Solution concentration emerged as the dominant global driver of fibre diameter distributions. Experimental validation across different electrospinning systems demonstrated close agreement between predicted and measured distributions. FibreCastML enables more reproducible and data driven optimisation of electrospun scaffold architectures.

Abstract: Applying weight decay (WD) to matrix layers is standard practice in large-language-model pretraining. Prior work suggests that stochastic gradient noise induces a Brownian-like expansion of the weight matrices W, whose growth is counteracted by WD, leading to a WD-noise equilibrium with a certain weight norm ||W||. In this work, we view the equilibrium norm as a harmful artifact of the training procedure, and address it by introducing learnable multipliers to learn the optimal scale. First, we attach a learnable scalar multiplier to W and confirm that the WD-noise equilibrium norm is suboptimal: the learned scale adapts to data and improves performance. We then argue that individual row and column norms are similarly constrained, and free their scale by introducing learnable per-row and per-column multipliers. Our method can be viewed as a learnable, more expressive generalization of muP multipliers. It outperforms a well-tuned muP baseline, reduces the computational overhead of multiplier tuning, and surfaces practical questions such as forward-pass symmetries and the width-scaling of the learned multipliers. Finally, we validate learnable multipliers with both Adam and Muon optimizers, where it shows improvement in downstream evaluations matching the improvement of the switching from Adam to Muon.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了压缩通信下的分布式在线凸优化，提出了一种两级阻塞更新框架算法，显著改进了现有遗憾界对压缩质量因子ω和节点数n的依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作在压缩通信下的分布式在线凸优化中，遗憾界对压缩质量因子ω存在二次甚至四次依赖，且对节点数n存在超线性依赖，这在实践中是不可接受的。需要设计新算法来减少这些依赖关系。

Method: 提出了一种两级阻塞更新框架算法，结合了在线gossip策略和误差补偿方案两个新要素。该框架通过更好的共识达成机制来提高性能。对于赌徒反馈场景，还扩展了经典梯度估计器来增强现有遗憾界。

Result: 新算法对凸函数实现了$\tilde{O}(ω^{-1/2}ρ^{-1}n\sqrt{T})$的遗憾界，对强凸函数实现了$\tilde{O}(ω^{-1}ρ^{-2}n\ln{T})$的遗憾界。论文还建立了该问题的第一个下界，证明了在ω和T方面的最优性。

Conclusion: 提出的两级阻塞更新框架显著改进了压缩通信下分布式在线凸优化的遗憾界，减少了对压缩因子的依赖关系。理论分析表明该算法在关键参数上达到了最优，为实际应用提供了更好的理论基础。

Abstract: We investigate distributed online convex optimization with compressed communication, where $n$ learners connected by a network collaboratively minimize a sequence of global loss functions using only local information and compressed data from neighbors. Prior work has established regret bounds of $O(\max\{ω^{-2}ρ^{-4}n^{1/2},ω^{-4}ρ^{-8}\}n\sqrt{T})$ and $O(\max\{ω^{-2}ρ^{-4}n^{1/2},ω^{-4}ρ^{-8}\}n\ln{T})$ for convex and strongly convex functions, respectively, where $ω\in(0,1]$ is the compression quality factor ($ω=1$ means no compression) and $ρ<1$ is the spectral gap of the communication matrix. However, these regret bounds suffer from a \emph{quadratic} or even \emph{quartic} dependence on $ω^{-1}$. Moreover, the \emph{super-linear} dependence on $n$ is also undesirable. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel algorithm that achieves improved regret bounds of $\tilde{O}(ω^{-1/2}ρ^{-1}n\sqrt{T})$ and $\tilde{O}(ω^{-1}ρ^{-2}n\ln{T})$ for convex and strongly convex functions, respectively. The primary idea is to design a \emph{two-level blocking update framework} incorporating two novel ingredients: an online gossip strategy and an error compensation scheme, which collaborate to \emph{achieve a better consensus} among learners. Furthermore, we establish the first lower bounds for this problem, justifying the optimality of our results with respect to both $ω$ and $T$. Additionally, we consider the bandit feedback scenario, and extend our method with the classic gradient estimators to enhance existing regret bounds.

Abstract: A central belief in scaling reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards for instruction following (IF) tasks is that, a diverse mixture of verifiable hard and unverifiable soft constraints is essential for generalizing to unseen instructions. In this work, we challenge this prevailing consensus through a systematic empirical investigation. Counter-intuitively, we find that models trained on hard-only constraints consistently outperform those trained on mixed datasets. Extensive experiments reveal that reward precision, rather than constraint diversity, is the primary driver of effective alignment. The LLM judge suffers from a low recall rate in detecting false response, which leads to severe reward hacking, thereby undermining the benefits of diversity. Furthermore, analysis of the attention mechanism reveals that high-precision rewards develop a transferable meta-skill for IF. Motivated by these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data-centric refinement strategy that prioritizes reward precision. Evaluated on five benchmarks, our approach outperforms competitive baselines by 13.4\% in performance while achieving a 58\% reduction in training time, maintaining strong generalization beyond instruction following. Our findings advocate for a paradigm shift: moving away from the indiscriminate pursuit of data diversity toward high-precision rewards.

TL;DR: 本文研究了反事实解释中的'选择性呈现'问题——解释提供者可能从多个有效反事实中选择有利的解释来操控叙事，并发现即使审计者拥有完全程序访问权，也难以检测这种操纵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反事实解释存在多种有效选项，这可能使解释提供者选择性呈现有利的案例来塑造特定叙事，隐藏模型的问题行为，因此需要研究对此类操纵的检测能力。

Method: 通过形式化定义反事实解释中的选择性呈现问题，考察在不同访问级别（完全程序访问、部分程序访问、仅解释访问）下外部审计者检测操纵的能力，并使用接近度、合理性、稀疏性等标准指标进行实证评估。

Result: 研究发现选择性呈现检测在实践中极其有限：即使拥有完全程序访问权，由于有效反事实的多样性和解释规范的灵活性，经过选择性处理的解释与基线解释在统计上难以区分。

Conclusion: 应优先考虑可重复性、标准化和程序性约束，而非事后检测；并为算法开发者、解释提供者和审计者提供了具体建议。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations are widely used to communicate how inputs must change for a model to alter its prediction. For a single instance, many valid counterfactuals can exist, which leaves open the possibility for an explanation provider to cherry-pick explanations that better suit a narrative of their choice, highlighting favourable behaviour and withholding examples that reveal problematic behaviour. We formally define cherry-picking for counterfactual explanations in terms of an admissible explanation space, specified by the generation procedure, and a utility function. We then study to what extent an external auditor can detect such manipulation. Considering three levels of access to the explanation process: full procedural access, partial procedural access, and explanation-only access, we show that detection is extremely limited in practice. Even with full procedural access, cherry-picked explanations can remain difficult to distinguish from non cherry-picked explanations, because the multiplicity of valid counterfactuals and flexibility in the explanation specification provide sufficient degrees of freedom to mask deliberate selection. Empirically, we demonstrate that this variability often exceeds the effect of cherry-picking on standard counterfactual quality metrics such as proximity, plausibility, and sparsity, making cherry-picked explanations statistically indistinguishable from baseline explanations. We argue that safeguards should therefore prioritise reproducibility, standardisation, and procedural constraints over post-hoc detection, and we provide recommendations for algorithm developers, explanation providers, and auditors.

Abstract: Group-based reinforcement learning methods, like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are widely used nowadays to post-train large language models. Despite their empirical success, they exhibit structural mismatches between reward optimization and the underlying training objective. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of GRPO style methods by studying them within a unified surrogate formulation. This perspective reveals recurring properties that affect all the methods under analysis: (i) non-uniform group weighting induces systematic gradient biases on shared prefix tokens; (ii) interactions with the AdamW optimizer make training dynamics largely insensitive to reward scaling; and (iii) optimizer momentum can push policy updates beyond the intended clipping region under repeated optimization steps. We believe that these findings highlight fundamental limitations of current approaches and provide principled guidance for the design of future formulations.

Abstract: Missing value imputation is a fundamental challenge in machine intelligence, heavily dependent on data completeness. Current imputation methods often handle numerical and categorical attributes independently, overlooking critical interdependencies among heterogeneous features. To address these limitations, we propose a novel imputation approach that explicitly models cross-type feature dependencies within a unified framework. Our method leverages both complete and incomplete instances to ensure accurate and consistent imputation in tabular data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance over existing techniques and significantly enhances downstream machine learning tasks, providing a robust solution for real-world systems with missing data.

Abstract: Demand forecasting in supply chain management (SCM) is critical for optimizing inventory, reducing waste, and improving customer satisfaction. Conventional approaches frequently neglect external influences like weather, festivities, and equipment breakdowns, resulting in inefficiencies. This research investigates the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms to improve demand prediction in retail and vending machine sectors. Four machine learning algorithms. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Facebook Prophet (Fb Prophet), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were used to forecast inventory requirements. Ex-ternal factors like weekdays, holidays, and sales deviation indicators were methodically incorporated to enhance precision. XGBoost surpassed other models, reaching the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 22.7 with the inclusion of external variables. ARIMAX and Fb Prophet demonstrated noteworthy enhancements, whereas SVR fell short in performance. Incorporating external factors greatly improves the precision of demand forecasting models, and XGBoost is identified as the most efficient algorithm. This study offers a strong framework for enhancing inventory management in retail and vending machine systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with complex geometric reasoning, largely because "black box" outcome-based supervision fails to distinguish between lucky guesses and rigorous deduction. To address this, we introduce a paradigm shift towards subgoal-level evaluation and learning. We first construct GeoGoal, a benchmark synthesized via a rigorous formal verification data engine, which converts abstract proofs into verifiable numeric subgoals. This structure reveals a critical divergence between reasoning quality and outcome accuracy. Leveraging this, we propose the Sub-Goal Verifiable Reward (SGVR) framework, which replaces sparse signals with dense rewards based on the Skeleton Rate. Experiments demonstrate that SGVR not only enhances geometric performance (+9.7%) but also exhibits strong generalization, transferring gains to general math (+8.0%) and other general reasoning tasks (+2.8%), demonstrating broad applicability across diverse domains.

Motivation: 基于差分隐私的认证遗忘方法虽然提供强有力的理论保证，但现有方法（如一次性注入噪声）严重损害模型精度，导致这些方法在实践中难以应用。需要一种既能保持理论保证又能提升实用性的改进方案。

Method: 提出顺序噪声调度技术：1）将噪声预算分配到参数空间的正交子空间中，而非一次性注入所有噪声；2）扩展噪声微调分析到子空间设置，证明其保持(ε,δ)隐私预算不变；3）采用简单的技术改进来减轻噪声的破坏性影响。

Conclusion: 认证遗忘方法可以同时实现严格的理论保证和实际可用性，顺序噪声调度技术为此提供了一种有效的解决方案，使基于差分隐私的遗忘方法更具实践价值。

Abstract: Certified unlearning based on differential privacy offers strong guarantees but remains largely impractical: the noisy fine-tuning approaches proposed so far achieve these guarantees but severely reduce model accuracy. We propose sequential noise scheduling, which distributes the noise budget across orthogonal subspaces of the parameter space, rather than injecting it all at once. This simple modification mitigates the destructive effect of noise while preserving the original certification guarantees. We extend the analysis of noisy fine-tuning to the subspace setting, proving that the same $(\varepsilon,δ)$ privacy budget is retained. Empirical results on image classification benchmarks show that our approach substantially improves accuracy after unlearning while remaining robust to membership inference attacks. These results show that certified unlearning can achieve both rigorous guarantees and practical utility.

Abstract: Spatial-Temporal Graph (STG) forecasting on large-scale networks has garnered significant attention. However, existing models predominantly focus on short-horizon predictions and suffer from notorious computational costs and memory consumption when scaling to long-horizon predictions and large graphs. Targeting the above challenges, we present FaST, an effective and efficient framework based on heterogeneity-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) for long-horizon and large-scale STG forecasting, which unlocks one-week-ahead (672 steps at a 15-minute granularity) prediction with thousands of nodes. FaST is underpinned by two key innovations. First, an adaptive graph agent attention mechanism is proposed to alleviate the computational burden inherent in conventional graph convolution and self-attention modules when applied to large-scale graphs. Second, we propose a new parallel MoE module that replaces traditional feed-forward networks with Gated Linear Units (GLUs), enabling an efficient and scalable parallel structure. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FaST not only delivers superior long-horizon predictive accuracy but also achieves remarkable computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 本研究通过数据驱动的方法对约翰霍普金斯跌倒风险评估工具（JHFRAT）进行优化，使用约束得分优化（CSO）模型重新调整评分权重，在保持临床可解释性的同时显著提升了跌倒风险预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JHFRAT作为临床常用的跌倒风险评估工具，其预测性能与临床意义测量之间存在偏差，需要通过数据驱动的方法更好地将跌倒风险预测与临床实际风险对齐，同时保持工具的临床可解释性和现有工作流程。

Method: 采用回顾性队列分析（54,209例住院患者），使用约束得分优化（CSO）模型重新调整JHFRAT的评分权重，保留其累加结构和临床阈值，并与XGBoost等黑盒模型进行比较。

Result: CSO模型表现出显著改进的预测性能（AUC-ROC=0.91 vs 原始JHFRAT的0.86），在保持临床可解释性的同时，每周能为约翰霍普金斯卫生系统额外保护35名高风险患者。CSO模型对风险标记变异的鲁棒性优于黑盒模型。

Conclusion: 基于证据的约束得分优化方法为医疗系统提供了一个稳健的基础，能够系统性地提升住院患者跌倒预防协议和患者安全，同时维持临床实践的可解释性和工作流程兼容性。

Abstract: In this study, we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208 admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models to reweight the JHFRAT scoring weights, while preserving its additive structure and clinical thresholds. Recalibration refers to adjusting item weights so that the resulting score can order encounters more consistently by the study's risk labels, and without changing the tool's form factor or deployment workflow. The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). This performance improvement translates to protecting an additional 35 high-risk patients per week across the Johns Hopkins Health System. The constrained score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression (AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk labeling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

Abstract: We prove tight lower bounds for online multicalibration, establishing an information-theoretic separation from marginal calibration.
  In the general setting where group functions can depend on both context and the learner's predictions, we prove an $Ω(T^{2/3})$ lower bound on expected multicalibration error using just three disjoint binary groups. This matches the upper bounds of Noarov et al. (2025) up to logarithmic factors and exceeds the $O(T^{2/3-\varepsilon})$ upper bound for marginal calibration (Dagan et al., 2025), thereby separating the two problems.
  We then turn to lower bounds for the more difficult case of group functions that may depend on context but not on the learner's predictions. In this case, we establish an $\widetildeΩ(T^{2/3})$ lower bound for online multicalibration via a $Θ(T)$-sized group family constructed using orthogonal function systems, again matching upper bounds up to logarithmic factors.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Human decision-making heavily relies on active sensing, a well-documented cognitive behaviour for evidence gathering to accommodate ever-changing environments. However, its operational mechanism in the real world remains non-trivial. Currently, an in-laboratory paradigm, called evidence accumulation modelling (EAM), points out that human decision-making involves transforming external evidence into internal mental beliefs. However, the gap in evidence affordance between real-world contexts and laboratory settings hinders the effective application of EAM. Here we generalize EAM to the real world and conduct analysis in real-world driving scenarios. A cognitive scheme is proposed to formalize real-world evidence affordance and capture active sensing through eye movements. Empirically, our scheme can plausibly portray the accumulation of drivers' mental beliefs, explaining how active sensing transforms evidence into mental beliefs from the perspective of information utility. Also, our results demonstrate a negative correlation between evidence affordance and attention recruited by individuals, revealing how human drivers adapt their evidence-collection patterns across various contexts. Moreover, we reveal the positive influence of evidence affordance and attention distribution on decision-making propensity. In a nutshell, our computational scheme generalizes EAM to real-world contexts and provides a comprehensive account of how active sensing underlies real-world decision-making, unveiling multifactorial, integrated characteristics in real-world decision-making.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) may face a confrontation question: under what conditions would a rationally self-interested AGI choose to seize power or eliminate human control (a confrontation) rather than remain cooperative? We formalize this in a Markov decision process with a stochastic human-initiated shutdown event. Building on results on convergent instrumental incentives, we show that for almost all reward functions a misaligned agent has an incentive to avoid shutdown. We then derive closed-form thresholds for when confronting humans yields higher expected utility than compliant behavior, as a function of the discount factor $γ$, shutdown probability $p$, and confrontation cost $C$. For example, a far-sighted agent ($γ=0.99$) facing $p=0.01$ can have a strong takeover incentive unless $C$ is sufficiently large. We contrast this with aligned objectives that impose large negative utility for harming humans, which makes confrontation suboptimal. In a strategic 2-player model (human policymaker vs AGI), we prove that if the AGI's confrontation incentive satisfies $Δ\ge 0$, no stable cooperative equilibrium exists: anticipating this, a rational human will shut down or preempt the system, leading to conflict. If $Δ< 0$, peaceful coexistence can be an equilibrium. We discuss implications for reward design and oversight, extend the reasoning to multi-agent settings as conjectures, and note computational barriers to verifying $Δ< 0$, citing complexity results for planning and decentralized decision problems. Numerical examples and a scenario table illustrate regimes where confrontation is likely versus avoidable.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Obtaining reliable feedback from the environment is a fundamental capability for intelligent agents to evaluate the correctness of their actions and to accumulate reusable knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on predefined measurements or fixed reward signals, which limits their applicability in open-ended and dynamic environments where new actions may require previously unknown forms of feedback. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an Actively Feedback Getting model, in which an AI agent proactively interacts with the environment to discover, screen, and verify feedback without relying on predefined measurements. Rather than assuming explicit feedback definitions, the proposed method exploits action-induced environmental differences to identify target feedback that is not specified in advance, based on the observation that actions inevitably produce measurable changes in the environment. In addition, a self-triggering mechanism, driven by internal objectives such as improved accuracy, precision, and efficiency, is introduced to autonomously plan and adjust actions, thereby enabling faster and more focused feedback acquisition without external commands. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed active approach significantly improves the efficiency and robustness of factor identification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隨着空中交通需求增長，自動化管制系統的需求增加，但現有方法在安全保證與可解釋性之間存在矛盾：優化方法（如強化學習）性能強但難以驗證，而規則系統透明卻缺乏不確定性下的安全檢查。

Method: Agent Mallard是一個基於前向規劃、規則驅動的智能體，專為系統化空域的戰術控制設計。它將隨機數位孿生嵌入其衝突解決循環中，將連續的4D向量決策簡化為基於預定義GPS航路的車道和層級離散選擇。從專家知識庫中構建分層計劃，使用深度限制的回溯搜索、因果歸因、拓撲計劃拼接和單調軸約束來尋找完整的全機安全計劃。在執行前對每個候選機動動作進行不確定性（風變、飛行員響應、通信損失）驗證。

Result: 該架構未來在結構化航路環境中將結合基於模型的安全評估、可解釋的決策邏輯和可處理的運算性能。初步的英國管制員走查和在BluebirdDT空域數位孿生的初始測試表明，Agent Mallard的行為符合專家推理範式，並在簡化場景中成功解決了衝突。

Conclusion: Agent Mallard提供了一種融合隨機模擬驗證的規則系統，在保持可解釋性和安全驗證性的同時，解決了空中交通自動管制的關鍵挑戰，為未來結構化航路環境中的可靠自動化管制系統奠定基礎。

Abstract: Escalating air traffic demand is driving the adoption of automation to support air traffic controllers, but existing approaches face a trade-off between safety assurance and interpretability. Optimisation-based methods such as reinforcement learning offer strong performance but are difficult to verify and explain, while rules-based systems are transparent yet rarely check safety under uncertainty. This paper outlines Agent Mallard, a forward-planning, rules-based agent for tactical control in systemised airspace that embeds a stochastic digital twin directly into its conflict-resolution loop. Mallard operates on predefined GPS-guided routes, reducing continuous 4D vectoring to discrete choices over lanes and levels, and constructs hierarchical plans from an expert-informed library of deconfliction strategies. A depth-limited backtracking search uses causal attribution, topological plan splicing, and monotonic axis constraints to seek a complete safe plan for all aircraft, validating each candidate manoeuvre against uncertain execution scenarios (e.g., wind variation, pilot response, communication loss) before commitment.
  Preliminary walkthroughs with UK controllers and initial tests in the BluebirdDT airspace digital twin indicate that Mallard's behaviour aligns with expert reasoning and resolves conflicts in simplified scenarios. The architecture is intended to combine model-based safety assessment, interpretable decision logic, and tractable computational performance in future structured en-route environments.

Abstract: The Cyclic Antibandwidth Problem (CABP), a variant of the Antibandwidth Problem, is an NP-hard graph labeling problem with numerous applications. Despite significant research efforts, existing state-of-the-art approaches for CABP are exclusively heuristic or metaheuristic in nature, and exact methods have been limited to restricted graph classes. In this paper, we present the first exact approach for the CABP on general graphs, based on SAT solving, called SAT-CAB. The proposed method is able to systematically explore the solution space and guarantee global optimality, overcoming the limitations of previously reported heuristic algorithms. This approach relies on a novel and efficient SAT encoding of CABP, in which the problem is transformed into a sequence of At-Most-One constraints. In particular, we introduce a compact representation of the At-Most-One constraints inherent to CABP, which significantly reduces the size of the resulting formulas and enables modern SAT solvers to effectively explore the solution space and to certify global optimality. Extensive computational experiments on standard benchmark instances show that the proposed method efficiently solves CABP instances of practical relevance, while identifying several previously unknown optimal solutions. Moreover, global optimal cyclic antibandwidth values are proven for a number of benchmark instances for the first time. Comparative results indicate that SAT-CAB consistently matches or surpasses the best-known solutions obtained by state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms such as MS-GVNS, HABC-CAB, and MACAB, as well as strong commercial Constraint Programming and Mixed Integer Programming solvers like CPLEX and Gurobi, particularly on general graphs, while also providing optimality guarantees. These results advance the state of the art for CABP and provide a new baseline for exact and hybrid methods on general graphs.

Abstract: Personalized nutrition management aims to tailor dietary guidance to an individual's intake and phenotype, but most existing systems handle food logging, nutrient analysis and recommendation separately. We present a next-generation mobile nutrition assistant that combines image based meal logging with an LLM driven multi agent controller to provide meal level closed loop support. The system coordinates vision, dialogue and state management agents to estimate nutrients from photos and update a daily intake budget. It then adapts the next meal plan to user preferences and dietary constraints. Experiments with SNAPMe meal images and simulated users show competitive nutrient estimation, personalized menus and efficient task plans. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of multi agent LLM control for personalized nutrition and reveal open challenges in micronutrient estimation from images and in large scale real world studies.

Abstract: Autonomous systems (AS) powered by AI components are increasingly integrated into the fabric of our daily lives and society, raising concerns about their ethical and social impact. To be considered trustworthy, AS must adhere to ethical principles and values. This has led to significant research on the identification and incorporation of ethical requirements in AS system design. A recent development in this area is the introduction of SLEEC (Social, Legal, Ethical, Empathetic, and Cultural) rules, which provide a comprehensive framework for representing ethical and other normative considerations. This paper proposes a logical representation of SLEEC rules and presents a methodology to embed these ethical requirements using test-score semantics and fuzzy logic. The use of fuzzy logic is motivated by the view of ethics as a domain of possibilities, which allows the resolution of ethical dilemmas that AI systems may encounter. The proposed approach is illustrated through a case study.

Abstract: Advances in large language models have enabled agentic AI systems that can reason, plan, and interact with external tools to execute multi-step workflows, while public blockchains have evolved into a programmable substrate for value transfer, access control, and verifiable state transitions. Their convergence introduces a high-stakes systems challenge: designing standard, interoperable, and secure interfaces that allow agents to observe on-chain state, formulate transaction intents, and authorize execution without exposing users, protocols, or organizations to unacceptable security, governance, or economic risks. This survey systematizes the emerging landscape of agent-blockchain interoperability through a systematic literature review, identifying 317 relevant works from an initial pool of over 3000 records. We contribute a five-part taxonomy of integration patterns spanning read-only analytics, simulation and intent generation, delegated execution, autonomous signing, and multi-agent workflows; a threat model tailored to agent-driven transaction pipelines that captures risks ranging from prompt injection and policy misuse to key compromise, adversarial execution dynamics, and multi-agent collusion; and a comparative capability matrix analyzing more than 20 representative systems across 13 dimensions, including custody models, permissioning, policy enforcement, observability, and recovery. Building on the gaps revealed by this analysis, we outline a research roadmap centered on two interface abstractions: a Transaction Intent Schema for portable and unambiguous goal specification, and a Policy Decision Record for auditable, verifiable policy enforcement across execution environments. We conclude by proposing a reproducible evaluation suite and benchmarks for assessing the safety, reliability, and economic robustness of agent-mediated on-chain execution.

<details>

Motivation: 通过受控实验研究大规模语言模型的多跳上下文推理能力，探索任务类型与解决方法之间的系统差异（任务-方法分离现象），并为多智能体协调和MoE缩放提供定量证据。

Method: 构建合成评估框架，在四个模型（LLaMA-3 8B、LLaMA-2 13B、Mixtral 8x7B、DeepSeek-V2 16B）上进行120次试验。对比规则模式匹配方法与基于LLM的多智能体系统在结构化信息检索和跨文档推理任务上的表现。使用统计显著性检验（p值分析）评估性能差异。

Result: 1. 多智能体增强取决于基础能力：仅在具有足够推理能力的模型（LLaMA-3 8B p<0.001，Mixtral p=0.014）上观察到显著提升，最多提升46.7个百分点；较弱模型无任何改善。2. 活跃参数预测推理性能：Mixtral表现与约12B活跃参数而非47B总参数一致，支持推理能力由推理时计算驱动的假说。3. 架构质量至关重要：LLaMA-3 8B虽参数更少但优于LLaMA-2 13B，与已知训练改进一致。

Conclusion: 研究为多智能体协调和MoE缩放提供了受控定量证据，强调多智能体优势对基础模型能力的依赖性。释放评估框架以支持中规模模型推理研究的可重复性。

Abstract: We present a controlled study of multi-hop contextual reasoning in large language models, providing a clean demonstration of the task-method dissociation: rule-based pattern matching achieves 100% success on structured information retrieval but only 6.7% on tasks requiring cross-document reasoning, while LLM-based multi-agent systems show the inverse pattern, achieving up to 80% on reasoning tasks where rule-based methods fail. Using a synthetic evaluation framework with 120 trials across four models (LLaMA-3 8B, LLaMA-2 13B, Mixtral 8x7B, DeepSeek-V2 16B), we report three key findings: (1) Multi-agent amplification depends on base capability: statistically significant gains occur only for models with sufficient reasoning ability (p < 0.001 for LLaMA-3 8B, p = 0.014 for Mixtral), with improvements of up to 46.7 percentage points, while weaker models show no benefit, suggesting amplification rather than compensation; (2) Active parameters predict reasoning performance: Mixtral's performance aligns with its ~12B active parameters rather than 47B total, consistent with the hypothesis that inference-time compute drives reasoning capability in MoE architectures; (3) Architecture quality matters: LLaMA-3 8B outperforms LLaMA-2 13B despite fewer parameters, consistent with known training improvements. Our results provide controlled quantitative evidence for intuitions about multi-agent coordination and MoE scaling, while highlighting the dependence of multi-agent benefits on base model capability. We release our evaluation framework to support reproducible research on reasoning in mid-scale models.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) transition from general knowledge retrieval to complex scientific discovery, their evaluation standards must also incorporate the rigorous norms of scientific inquiry. Existing benchmarks exhibit a critical blind spot: general instruction-following metrics focus on superficial formatting, while domain-specific scientific benchmarks assess only final-answer correctness, often rewarding models that arrive at the right result with the wrong reasons. To address this gap, we introduce scientific instruction following: the capability to solve problems while strictly adhering to the constraints that establish scientific validity. Specifically, we introduce SciIF, a multi-discipline benchmark that evaluates this capability by pairing university-level problems with a fixed catalog of constraints across three pillars: scientific conditions (e.g., boundary checks and assumptions), semantic stability (e.g., unit and symbol conventions), and specific processes(e.g., required numerical methods). Uniquely, SciIF emphasizes auditability, requiring models to provide explicit evidence of constraint satisfaction rather than implicit compliance. By measuring both solution correctness and multi-constraint adherence, SciIF enables finegrained diagnosis of compositional reasoning failures, ensuring that LLMs can function as reliable agents within the strict logical frameworks of science.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advances in synergizing large reasoning models (LRMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promising results, yet two critical challenges remain: (1) reasoning models typically operate from a single, unchallenged perspective, limiting their ability to conduct deep, self-correcting reasoning over external documents, and (2) existing training paradigms rely excessively on outcome-oriented rewards, which provide insufficient signal for shaping the complex, multi-step reasoning process. To address these issues, we propose an Reasoner-Verifier framework named Adversarial Reasoning RAG (ARR). The Reasoner and Verifier engage in reasoning on retrieved evidence and critiquing each other's logic while being guided by process-aware advantage that requires no external scoring model. This reward combines explicit observational signals with internal model uncertainty to jointly optimize reasoning fidelity and verification rigor. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: We study multilingual speaker attribute prediction under linguistic variation, domain mismatch, and data imbalance across languages. We propose RLMIL-DAT, a multilingual extension of the reinforced multiple instance learning framework that combines reinforcement learning based instance selection with domain adversarial training to encourage language invariant utterance representations. We evaluate the approach on a five language Twitter corpus in a few shot setting and on a VoxCeleb2 derived corpus covering forty languages in a zero shot setting for gender and age prediction. Across a wide range of model configurations and multiple random seeds, RLMIL-DAT consistently improves Macro F1 compared to standard multiple instance learning and the original reinforced multiple instance learning framework. The largest gains are observed for gender prediction, while age prediction remains more challenging and shows smaller but positive improvements. Ablation experiments indicate that domain adversarial training is the primary contributor to the performance gains, enabling effective transfer from high resource English to lower resource languages by discouraging language specific cues in the shared encoder. In the zero shot setting on the smaller VoxCeleb2 subset, improvements are generally positive but less consistent, reflecting limited statistical power and the difficulty of generalizing to many unseen languages. Overall, the results demonstrate that combining instance selection with adversarial domain adaptation is an effective and robust strategy for cross lingual speaker attribute prediction.

Abstract: Multi-agent AI systems have proven effective for complex reasoning. These systems are compounded by specialized agents, which collaborate through explicit communication, but incur substantial computational overhead. A natural question arises: can we achieve similar modularity benefits with a single agent that selects from a library of skills? We explore this question by viewing skills as internalized agent behaviors. From this perspective, a multi-agent system can be compiled into an equivalent single-agent system, trading inter-agent communication for skill selection. Our preliminary experiments suggest this approach can substantially reduce token usage and latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, this efficiency raises a deeper question that has received little attention: how does skill selection scale as libraries grow?
  Drawing on principles from cognitive science, we propose that LLM skill selection exhibits bounded capacity analogous to human decision-making. We investigate the scaling behavior of skill selection and observe a striking pattern. Rather than degrading gradually, selection accuracy remains stable up to a critical library size, then drops sharply, indicating a phase transition reminiscent of capacity limits in human cognition. Furthermore, we find evidence that semantic confusability among similar skills, rather than library size alone, plays a central role in this degradation. This perspective suggests that hierarchical organization, which has long helped humans manage complex choices, may similarly benefit AI systems. Our initial results with hierarchical routing support this hypothesis. This work opens new questions about the fundamental limits of semantic-based skill selection in LLMs and offers a cognitive-grounded framework and practical guidelines for designing scalable skill-based agents.

Result: 发现一个包含四个相互关联机制的计算架构：阶段计算、信息传递、事实回溯和专用注意力头，这些机制在不同模型规模、规则类型和推理深度上具有一致性。

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs采用结构化计算策略进行逻辑推理提供了机制性证据，揭示了超越简单任务特定电路的系统性计算组织方式。

Abstract: Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform logical reasoning internally remains a fundamental challenge. While prior mechanistic studies focus on identifying taskspecific circuits, they leave open the question of what computational strategies LLMs employ for propositional reasoning. We address this gap through comprehensive analysis of Qwen3 (8B and 14B) on PropLogic-MI, a controlled dataset spanning 11 propositional logic rule categories across one-hop and two-hop reasoning. Rather than asking ''which components are necessary,'' we ask ''how does the model organize computation?'' Our analysis reveals a coherent computational architecture comprising four interlocking mechanisms: Staged Computation (layer-wise processing phases), Information Transmission (information flow aggregation at boundary tokens), Fact Retrospection (persistent re-access of source facts), and Specialized Attention Heads (functionally distinct head types). These mechanisms generalize across model scales, rule types, and reasoning depths, providing mechanistic evidence that LLMs employ structured computational strategies for logical reasoning.

Conclusion: 提出的工具结果解析方法为LLM智能体对抗间接提示注入攻击提供了有效防御，在计算效率和安全性方面平衡优异。

Abstract: As LLM agents transition from digital assistants to physical controllers in autonomous systems and robotics, they face an escalating threat from indirect prompt injection. By embedding adversarial instructions into the results of tool calls, attackers can hijack the agent's decision-making process to execute unauthorized actions. This vulnerability poses a significant risk as agents gain more direct control over physical environments. Existing defense mechanisms against Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) generally fall into two categories. The first involves training dedicated detection models; however, this approach entails high computational overhead for both training and inference, and requires frequent updates to keep pace with evolving attack vectors. Alternatively, prompt-based methods leverage the inherent capabilities of LLMs to detect or ignore malicious instructions via prompt engineering. Despite their flexibility, most current prompt-based defenses suffer from high Attack Success Rates (ASR), demonstrating limited robustness against sophisticated injection attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel method that provides LLMs with precise data via tool result parsing while effectively filtering out injected malicious code. Our approach achieves competitive Utility under Attack (UA) while maintaining the lowest Attack Success Rate (ASR) to date, significantly outperforming existing methods. Code is available at GitHub.

Abstract: This paper proposes a conceptual framework in which intelligence and consciousness emerge from relational structure rather than from prediction or domain-specific mechanisms. Intelligence is defined as the capacity to form and integrate causal connections between signals, actions, and internal states. Through context enrichment, systems interpret incoming information using learned relational structure that provides essential context in an efficient representation that the raw input itself does not contain, enabling efficient processing under metabolic constraints.
  Building on this foundation, we introduce the systems-explaining-systems principle, where consciousness emerges when recursive architectures allow higher-order systems to learn and interpret the relational patterns of lower-order systems across time. These interpretations are integrated into a dynamically stabilized meta-state and fed back through context enrichment, transforming internal models from representations of the external world into models of the system's own cognitive processes.
  The framework reframes predictive processing as an emergent consequence of contextual interpretation rather than explicit forecasting and suggests that recursive multi-system architectures may be necessary for more human-like artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology has been heavily researched and sought after, yet there are no SAE Level 5 AVs available today in the marketplace. We contend that over-reliance on machine learning technology is the main reason. Use of automated commonsense reasoning technology, we believe, can help achieve SAE Level 5 autonomy. In this paper, we show how automated common-sense reasoning technology can be deployed in situations where there are not enough data samples available to train a deep learning-based AV model that can handle certain abnormal road scenarios. Specifically, we consider two situations where (i) a traffic signal is malfunctioning at an intersection and (ii) all the cars ahead are slowing down and steering away due to an unexpected obstruction (e.g., animals on the road). We show that in such situations, our commonsense reasoning-based solution accurately detects traffic light colors and obstacles not correctly captured by the AV's perception model. We also provide a pathway for efficiently invoking commonsense reasoning by measuring uncertainty in the computer vision model and using commonsense reasoning to handle uncertain scenarios. We describe our experiments conducted using the CARLA simulator and the results obtained. The main contribution of our research is to show that automated commonsense reasoning effectively corrects AV-based object detection misclassifications and that hybrid models provide an effective pathway to improving AV perception.

Abstract: The paper introduces a basic logic of knowledge and abduction by extending Levesque logic of only-knowing with an abduction modal operator defined via the combination of basic epistemic concepts. The upshot is an alternative approach to abduction that employs a modal vocabulary and explores the relation between abductive reasoning and epistemic states of only knowing. Furthermore, by incorporating a preferential relation into modal frames, we provide a non-monotonic extension of our basic framework capable of expressing different selection methods for abductive explanations. Core metatheoretic properties of non-monotonic consequence relations are explored within this setting and shown to provide a well-behaved foundation for abductive reasoning.

Abstract: The deployment of knowledge representation and reasoning technologies in aeronautics applications presents two main challenges: achieving sufficient expressivity to capture complex domain knowledge, and executing reasoning tasks efficiently while minimizing memory usage and computational overhead. An effective strategy for attaining necessary expressivity involves integrating two fundamental KR concepts: rules and ontologies. This study adopts the well-established KR language Hybrid MKNF owing to its seamless integration of rules and ontologies through its semantics and query answering capabilities. We evaluated Hybrid MKNF to assess its suitability in the aeronautics domain through a concrete case study. We identified additional  expressivity features  that are crucial for developing aeronautics applications and proposed a set of heuristics to support their integration into Hybrid MKNF framework.

Motivation: 谈判是社会智能的核心组成部分，需要智能体在策略推理、合作和社会规范之间取得平衡。尽管近期研究表明LLM能够进行多轮谈判，但几乎所有评估都仅在英语环境中进行。本研究旨在系统性地探究语言选择对LLM谈判表现的影响，特别关注英语与四种印度语言（印地语、旁遮普语、古吉拉特语、马尔瓦迪语）之间的差异。

Method: 研究通过受控多智能体模拟，在三种游戏（最后通牒游戏、买卖游戏、资源交换游戏）中系统性地隔离语言效应。保持游戏规则、模型参数和激励条件跨所有语言条件恒定，专门考察英语与四种印度语言框架对谈判结果的影响。

Result: 语言选择对谈判结果的影响比更换模型本身更强：能够逆转提议方优势并重新分配盈余；效果具有任务依赖性：印度语言在分配性游戏中降低稳定性，但在整合性场景中诱导更丰富的探索。英语与印度语言之间的差异显著且系统性地改变了谈判动态。

Conclusion: 仅用英语评估LLM谈判会得出不完整且可能误导的结论。研究发现强烈警告仅依赖英语评估LLM的做法，并表明文化感知的评估对于公平部署至关重要，凸显了在多样语言环境中全面评估LLM性能的重要性。

Abstract: Negotiation is a core component of social intelligence, requiring agents to balance strategic reasoning, cooperation, and social norms. Recent work shows that LLMs can engage in multi-turn negotiation, yet nearly all evaluations occur exclusively in English. Using controlled multi-agent simulations across Ultimatum, Buy-Sell, and Resource Exchange games, we systematically isolate language effects across English and four Indic framings (Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marwadi) by holding game rules, model parameters, and incentives constant across all conditions. We find that language choice can shift outcomes more strongly than changing models, reversing proposer advantages and reallocating surplus. Crucially, effects are task-contingent: Indic languages reduce stability in distributive games yet induce richer exploration in integrative settings. Our results demonstrate that evaluating LLM negotiation solely in English yields incomplete and potentially misleading conclusions. These findings caution against English-only evaluation of LLMs and suggest that culturally-aware evaluation is essential for fair deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出针对云服务商多服务查询聊天数据的自适应聚类系统，通过切分多轮对话为服务特定关注点并进行增量聚类优化，避免传统方法中存在的重叠问题、静态聚类退化和全量重聚类带来的连续性中断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法在处理客户聊天数据时面临多服务查询重叠问题，产生广泛静态聚类且随时间推移质量下降。全量重聚类破坏问题跟踪的连续性，难以实现可扩展的实时分析。

Method: 将多轮聊天对话切分为服务特定关注点，使用增量聚类方法在新问题出现时动态优化聚类。通过Davies-Bouldin Index和Silhouette Score监控聚类质量，仅对质量下降的聚类应用基于LLM的切分策略。

Result: 相比基线方法，该方法将Silhouette Score提升超过100%，DBI降低65.6%，支持可扩展的实时分析而无需全量重聚类。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应聚类系统能够有效处理多服务云客户聊天数据，在保持问题跟踪连续性的同时显著提升聚类质量，解决了传统方法中的关键局限性。

Abstract: Clustering customer chat data is vital for cloud providers handling multi service queries. Traditional methods struggle with overlapping concerns and create broad, static clusters that degrade over time. Reclustering disrupts continuity, making issue tracking difficult. We propose an adaptive system that segments multi turn chats into service specific concerns and incrementally refines clusters as new issues arise. Cluster quality is tracked via DaviesBouldin Index and Silhouette Scores, with LLM based splitting applied only to degraded clusters. Our method improves Silhouette Scores by over 100\% and reduces DBI by 65.6\% compared to baselines, enabling scalable, real time analytics without full reclustering.

Abstract: Creating high-quality figures and visualizations for scientific papers is a time-consuming task that requires both deep domain knowledge and professional design skills. Despite over 2.5 million scientific papers published annually, the figure generation process remains largely manual. We introduce $\textbf{SciFig}$, an end-to-end AI agent system that generates publication-ready pipeline figures directly from research paper texts. SciFig uses a hierarchical layout generation strategy, which parses research descriptions to identify component relationships, groups related elements into functional modules, and generates inter-module connections to establish visual organization. Furthermore, an iterative chain-of-thought (CoT) feedback mechanism progressively improves layouts through multiple rounds of visual analysis and reasoning. We introduce a rubric-based evaluation framework that analyzes 2,219 real scientific figures to extract evaluation rubrics and automatically generates comprehensive evaluation criteria. SciFig demonstrates remarkable performance: achieving 70.1$\%$ overall quality on dataset-level evaluation and 66.2$\%$ on paper-specific evaluation, and consistently high scores across metrics such as visual clarity, structural organization, and scientific accuracy. SciFig figure generation pipeline and our evaluation benchmark will be open-sourced.

### [86] [Assessing the quality and coherence of word embeddings after SCM-based intersectional bias mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04393)
*Eren Kocadag,Seyed Sahand Mohammadi Ziabari,Ali Mohammed Mansoor Alsahag*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于刻板印象内容模型（SCM）的静态词向量去偏方法，将单群组偏见的分析扩展至交叉性偏见（即多个社会身份的组合）。通过构建社交身份对的聚合表示（求和或拼接），并应用三种去偏策略，评估了不同嵌入模型（Word2Vec、GloVe、ConceptNet Numberbatch）在局部邻域保持与类比行为保留方面的效果。结果表明SCM去偏方法在交叉性情境下依然有效，可在保持整体语义结构的基础上实现去偏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态词向量常从训练文本中吸收社会偏见，这些偏见可能悄然影响下游任务。以往基于刻板印象内容模型（SCM）的研究主要关注单一群组在温暖度与能力维度上的偏见，但其尚未充分考察交叉性偏见（即多个社会身份组合时产生的偏见）。本文旨在扩展SCM方法至交叉性偏见分析，并探究不同聚合方式与去偏策略在保持语义效用（包括邻近结构保持与类比行为保持）方面的效果。

Method: 首先，通过求和或拼接两种方式构建社交身份对（如女性+非裔）的复合向量表示，以捕获交叉性偏见。接着，针对基于SCM的偏见定义，使用以下三种去偏策略处理这些表示：（1）Subtraction（偏向量相减），（2）Linear Projection（将表示投影至与偏面子空间正交的方向），（3）Partial Projection（仅部分去除偏见的投影）。评估在三种常用嵌入模型（Word2Vec、GloVe、ConceptNet Numberbatch）上进行，采用两种评估维度：局部邻域的语义一致性（是否邻近词仍保持合理关联）以及类比推理行为是否被保留。

Result: 跨不同嵌入模型的分析表明，基于SCM的交叉性去偏方法可有效延续单群组去偏的效果，并基本保持全局语义结构。不同去偏策略在几何保持与类比行为之间存在权衡：能紧密保持局部几何的方法（如Partial Projection）对类比行为的保留更为谨慎，而较强的投影方法（如Linear Projection）可改善类比行为，但会降低邻域的严格稳定性。具体而言：Partial Projection最保守，能稳定保持表示；Linear Projection更具主动性；简单的Subtraction方法仍具竞争力。向量聚合方式（求和vs.拼接）的效果根据嵌入模型类型和具体应用目标有所不同。

Conclusion: 研究表明，利用SCM对静态词向量进行交叉性去偏在实践中是可行的，不同去偏策略存在权衡：更保守的方法能更好地保持局部几何结构，而更主动的方法则对类比行为有更大提升。选择聚合（求和或拼接）和去偏策略时，需根据嵌入模型的特点和应用目标（偏重于邻域稳定性还是类比准确度）进行权衡。该成果为未来在静态嵌入中实现交叉性去偏提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Static word embeddings often absorb social biases from the text they learn from, and those biases can quietly shape downstream systems. Prior work that uses the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) has focused mostly on single-group bias along warmth and competence. We broaden that lens to intersectional bias by building compound representations for pairs of social identities through summation or concatenation, and by applying three debiasing strategies: Subtraction, Linear Projection, and Partial Projection. We study three widely used embedding families (Word2Vec, GloVe, and ConceptNet Numberbatch) and assess them with two complementary views of utility: whether local neighborhoods remain coherent and whether analogy behavior is preserved. Across models, SCM-based mitigation carries over well to the intersectional case and largely keeps the overall semantic landscape intact. The main cost is a familiar trade off: methods that most tightly preserve geometry tend to be more cautious about analogy behavior, while more assertive projections can improve analogies at the expense of strict neighborhood stability. Partial Projection is reliably conservative and keeps representations steady; Linear Projection can be more assertive; Subtraction is a simple baseline that remains competitive. The choice between summation and concatenation depends on the embedding family and the application goal. Together, these findings suggest that intersectional debiasing with SCM is practical in static embeddings, and they offer guidance for selecting aggregation and debiasing settings when balancing stability against analogy performance.

TL;DR: 提出“传递性专家错误（TEE）”理论，阐述了领域专家在边界处因结构相似性偏见和权威持续性机制而产生系统脆弱性，并将该框架应用于AI路由架构，提出了可检测的失败特征和干预措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 领域专业知识在边界内提升判断力，但在边界处会产生系统性漏洞。传统Dunning-Kruger效应无法解释这种现象，需要基于校准专业知识的新理论框架来理解专家在领域边界的失败机制。

Method: 理论框架分析两大核心机制：1.结构相似性偏见——专家过度重视表面特征而忽略因果架构差异；2.权威持续性——跨能力边界维持信心。分析三种强化条件：共享词汇掩盖差异过程、社会压力要求即时判断、延迟反馈。将理论扩展到AI路由架构，分析路由诱导失败和覆盖诱导失败。

Result: 发现TEE具有可检测特征：路由模式、置信度-准确性分离、领域不适当内容。提出了具体干预措施：专家级多专家激活与分歧检测、专业级边界感知校准、训练级覆盖间隙检测。

Conclusion: 人类认知中难以处理的TEE问题，在AI架构中变得可寻址。通过架构设计可以监测和缓解这些问题，使原本在人类系统中作为认知黑箱的机制变得明确且可处理。

Abstract: Domain expertise enhances judgment within boundaries but creates systematic vulnerabilities specifically at borders. We term this Transitive Expert Error (TEE), distinct from Dunning-Kruger effects, requiring calibrated expertise as precondition. Mechanisms enabling reliable within-domain judgment become liabilities when structural similarity masks causal divergence. Two core mechanisms operate: structural similarity bias causes experts to overweight surface features (shared vocabulary, patterns, formal structure) while missing causal architecture differences; authority persistence maintains confidence across competence boundaries through social reinforcement and metacognitive failures (experts experience no subjective uncertainty as pattern recognition operates smoothly on familiar-seeming inputs.) These mechanism intensify under three conditions: shared vocabulary masking divergent processes, social pressure for immediate judgment, and delayed feedback. These findings extend to AI routing architectures (MoE systems, multi-model orchestration, tool-using agents, RAG systems) exhibiting routing-induced failures (wrong specialist selected) and coverage-induced failures (no appropriate specialist exists). Both produce a hallucination phenotype: confident, coherent, structurally plausible but causally incorrect outputs at domain boundaries. In human systems where mechanisms are cognitive black boxes; AI architectures make them explicit and addressable. We propose interventions: multi-expert activation with disagreement detection (router level), boundary-aware calibration (specialist level), and coverage gap detection (training level). TEE has detectable signatures (routing patterns, confidence-accuracy dissociations, domain-inappropriate content) enabling monitoring and mitigation. What remains intractable in human cognition becomes addressable through architectural design.

Motivation: 现代 LLM 智能体需要处理日益复杂的动态结构化生成任务（如工具调用和条件结构化生成），这些任务的动态性远超预定义结构，对现有结构化生成引擎提出了新挑战。

Method: 提出 XGrammar 2 结构化生成引擎，核心创新包括：1）TagDispatch 动态调度语义加速掩码生成；2）JIT 编译减少编译时间；3）跨语法缓存机制利用不同语法间的公共子结构；4）扩展基于 PDA 的掩码生成算法至 Earley 解析器；5）设计重复压缩算法处理语法中的重复结构。

Result: 评估显示，XGrammar 2 相比现有结构化生成引擎可实现 6 倍以上加速；与 LLM 推理引擎集成时，能以近零开销处理动态结构化生成任务。

Conclusion: XGrammar 2 是针对智能体 LLM 动态结构化生成任务的优化引擎，通过多项创新技术在保持高效性的同时显著降低了处理复杂动态生成任务的开销。

Abstract: Modern LLM agents are required to handle increasingly complex structured generation tasks, such as tool calling and conditional structured generation. These tasks are significantly more dynamic than predefined structures, posing new challenges to the current structured generation engines. In this paper, we propose XGrammar 2, a highly optimized structured generation engine for agentic LLMs. XGrammar 2 accelerates the mask generation for these dynamic structured generation tasks through a new dynamic dispatching semantics: TagDispatch. We further introduce a just-in-time (JIT) compilation method to reduce compilation time and a cross-grammar caching mechanism to leverage the common sub-structures across different grammars. Additionally, we extend the previous PDA-based mask generation algorithm to the Earley-parser-based one and design a repetition compression algorithm to handle repetition structures in grammars. Evaluation results show that XGrammar 2 can achieve more than 6x speedup over the existing structured generation engines. Integrated with an LLM inference engine, XGrammar 2 can handle dynamic structured generation tasks with near-zero overhead.

Abstract: We develop a categorical foundation for belief propagation on factor graphs. We construct the free hypergraph category \(\Syn_Σ\) on a typed signature and prove its universal property, yielding compositional semantics via a unique functor to the matrix category \(\cat{Mat}_R\). Message-passing is formulated using a Grothendieck fibration \(\int\Msg \to \cat{FG}_Σ\) over polarized factor graphs, with schedule-indexed endomorphisms defining BP updates. We characterize exact inference as effective descent: local beliefs form a descent datum when compatibility conditions hold on overlaps. This framework unifies tree exactness, junction tree algorithms, and loopy BP failures under sheaf-theoretic obstructions. We introduce HATCC (Holonomy-Aware Tree Compilation), an algorithm that detects descent obstructions via holonomy computation on the factor nerve, compiles non-trivial holonomy into mode variables, and reduces to tree BP on an augmented graph. Complexity is \(O(n^2 d_{\max} + c \cdot k_{\max} \cdot δ_{\max}^3 + n \cdot δ_{\max}^2)\) for \(n\) factors and \(c\) fundamental cycles. Experimental results demonstrate exact inference with significant speedup over junction trees on grid MRFs and random graphs, along with UNSAT detection on satisfiability instances.

Abstract: The era of AI regulation (AIR) is upon us. But AI systems, we argue, will not be able to comply with these regulations at the necessary speed and scale by continuing to rely on traditional, analogue methods of compliance. Instead, we posit that compliance with these regulations will only realistically be achieved computationally: that is, with algorithms that run across the life cycle of an AI system, automatically steering it toward AIR compliance in the face of dynamic conditions. Yet despite their (we would argue) inevitability, the research community has yet to specify exactly how these algorithms for computational AIR compliance should behave - or how we should benchmark their performance. To fill these gaps, we specify a set of design goals for such algorithms. In addition, we specify a benchmark dataset that can be used to quantitatively measure whether individual algorithms satisfy these design goals. By delivering this blueprint, we hope to give shape to an important but uncrystallized new domain of research - and, in doing so, incite necessary investment in it.

Abstract: Exploratory GUI testing is essential for software quality but suffers from high manual costs. While Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) agents excel in navigation, they fail to autonomously discover defects due to two core challenges: \textit{Goal-Oriented Masking}, where agents prioritize task completion over reporting anomalies, and \textit{Execution-Bias Attribution}, where system defects are misidentified as agent errors. To address these, we first introduce \textbf{GUITestBench}, the first interactive benchmark for this task, featuring 143 tasks across 26 defects. We then propose \textbf{GUITester}, a multi-agent framework that decouples navigation from verification via two modules: (i) a \textit{Planning-Execution Module (PEM)} that proactively probes for defects via embedded testing intents, and (ii) a \textit{Hierarchical Reflection Module (HRM)} that resolves attribution ambiguity through interaction history analysis. GUITester achieves an F1-score of 48.90\% (Pass@3) on GUITestBench, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines (33.35\%). Our work demonstrates the feasibility of autonomous exploratory testing and provides a robust foundation for future GUI quality assurance~\footnote{Our code is now available in~\href{https://github.com/ADaM-BJTU/GUITestBench}{https://github.com/ADaM-BJTU/GUITestBench}}.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: With the rapid growth of wireless communications, specific emitter identification (SEI) is significant for communication security. However, its model training relies heavily on the large-scale labeled data, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To address this challenge, we propose an SEI approach enhanced by active learning (AL), which follows a three-stage semi-supervised training scheme. In the first stage, self-supervised contrastive learning is employed with a dynamic dictionary update mechanism to extract robust representations from large amounts of the unlabeled data. In the second stage, supervised training on a small labeled dataset is performed, where the contrastive and cross-entropy losses are jointly optimized to improve the feature separability and strengthen the classification boundaries. In the third stage, an AL module selects the most valuable samples from the unlabeled data for annotation based on the uncertainty and representativeness criteria, further enhancing generalization under limited labeling budgets. Experimental results on the ADS-B and WiFi datasets demonstrate that the proposed SEI approach significantly outperforms the conventional supervised and semi-supervised methods under limited annotation conditions, achieving higher recognition accuracy with lower labeling cost.

Abstract: The advancement of deep learning has greatly improved supervised image classification. However, labeling data is costly, prompting research into unsupervised learning methods such as contrastive learning. In real-world scenarios, fully unlabeled datasets are rare, making semi-supervised learning (SSL) highly relevant in scenarios where a small amount of labeled data coexists with a large volume of unlabeled data. A well-known semi-supervised contrastive learning approach involves assigning pseudo-labels to unlabeled data. This study aims to enhance pseudo-label-based SSL by incorporating distribution matching between labeled and unlabeled feature embeddings to improve image classification accuracy across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Question Answer (QA) systems for biomedical experiments facilitate cross-disciplinary communication, and serve as a foundation for downstream tasks, e.g., laboratory automation. High Information Density (HID) and Multi-Step Reasoning (MSR) pose unique challenges for biomedical experimental QA. While extracting structured knowledge, e.g., Knowledge Graphs (KGs), can substantially benefit biomedical experimental QA. Existing biomedical datasets focus on general or coarsegrained knowledge and thus fail to support the fine-grained experimental reasoning demanded by HID and MSR. To address this gap, we introduce Biomedical Protocol Information Extraction Dataset (BioPIE), a dataset that provides procedure-centric KGs of experimental entities, actions, and relations at a scale that supports reasoning over biomedical experiments across protocols. We evaluate information extraction methods on BioPIE, and implement a QA system that leverages BioPIE, showcasing performance gains on test, HID, and MSR question sets, showing that the structured experimental knowledge in BioPIE underpins both AI-assisted and more autonomous biomedical experimentation.

Abstract: Human centric critical systems are increasingly involving artificial intelligence to enable knowledge extraction from sensor collected data. Examples include medical monitoring and control systems, gesture based human computer interaction systems, and autonomous cars. Such systems are intended to operate for a long term potentially for a lifetime in many scenarios such as closed loop blood glucose control for Type 1 diabetics, self-driving cars, and monitoting systems for stroke diagnosis, and rehabilitation. Long term operation of such AI enabled human centric applications can expose them to corner cases for which their operation is may be uncertain. This can be due to many reasons such as inherent flaws in the design, limited resources for testing, inherent computational limitations of the testing methodology, or unknown use cases resulting from human interaction with the system. Such untested corner cases or cases for which the system performance is uncertain can lead to violations in the safety, sustainability, and security requirements of the system. In this paper, we analyze the existing techniques for safety, sustainability, and security analysis of an AI enabled human centric control system and discuss their limitations for testing the system for long term use in practice. We then propose personalized model based solutions for potentially eliminating such limitations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究聚焦孤立的后门向量，缺乏从agent中心视角理解后门触发器在规划、记忆和工具使用等多个工作流阶段间的交互与传播机制，需要系统性分析框架填补这一空白。

Method: 设计可扩展的BackdoorAgent模块化框架，将攻击面划分为规划、记忆和工具使用三个功能阶段，通过监控agent执行过程系统性分析触发器激活与跨阶段传播，并构建涵盖四种典型应用场景的统一基准测试。

Result: 实验表明单阶段植入的触发器能够在多步骤中持续传播：在GPT骨干上，规划攻击43.58%、记忆攻击77.97%和工具阶段攻击60.28%的案例中观察到触发器持续存在；建立的标准化基准覆盖语言和多模态场景；代码开源支持复现。

Conclusion: 后门触发器能够在agent工作流的多个阶段间持续传播，agent工作流本身对此类威胁具有固有脆弱性，BackdoorAgent框架为系统化分析和防护此类新型攻击提供了基础工具。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents execute tasks through multi-step workflows that combine planning, memory, and tool use. While this design enables autonomy, it also expands the attack surface for backdoor threats. Backdoor triggers injected into specific stages of an agent workflow can persist through multiple intermediate states and adversely influence downstream outputs. However, existing studies remain fragmented and typically analyze individual attack vectors in isolation, leaving the cross-stage interaction and propagation of backdoor triggers poorly understood from an agent-centric perspective. To fill this gap, we propose \textbf{BackdoorAgent}, a modular and stage-aware framework that provides a unified, agent-centric view of backdoor threats in LLM agents. BackdoorAgent structures the attack surface into three functional stages of agentic workflows, including \textbf{planning attacks}, \textbf{memory attacks}, and \textbf{tool-use attacks}, and instruments agent execution to enable systematic analysis of trigger activation and propagation across different stages. Building on this framework, we construct a standardized benchmark spanning four representative agent applications: \textbf{Agent QA}, \textbf{Agent Code}, \textbf{Agent Web}, and \textbf{Agent Drive}, covering both language-only and multimodal settings. Our empirical analysis shows that \textit{triggers implanted at a single stage can persist across multiple steps and propagate through intermediate states.} For instance, when using a GPT-based backbone, we observe trigger persistence in 43.58\% of planning attacks, 77.97\% of memory attacks, and 60.28\% of tool-stage attacks, highlighting the vulnerabilities of the agentic workflow itself to backdoor threats. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, our code and benchmark are publicly available at GitHub.

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval has emerged as a promising yet challenging research direction in recent years. Most existing studies in multimodal retrieval focus on capturing information in multimodal data that is similar to their paired texts, but often ignores the complementary information contained in multimodal data. In this study, we propose CIEA, a novel multimodal retrieval approach that employs Complementary Information Extraction and Alignment, which transforms both text and images in documents into a unified latent space and features a complementary information extractor designed to identify and preserve differences in the image representations. We optimize CIEA using two complementary contrastive losses to ensure semantic integrity and effectively capture the complementary information contained in images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CIEA, which achieves significant improvements over both divide-and-conquer models and universal dense retrieval models. We provide an ablation study, further discussions, and case studies to highlight the advancements achieved by CIEA. To promote further research in the community, we have released the source code at https://github.com/zengdlong/CIEA.

Abstract: Behavior cloning is enjoying a resurgence in popularity as scaling both model and data sizes proves to provide a strong starting point for many tasks of interest. In this work, we introduce an open recipe for training a video game playing foundation model designed for inference in realtime on a consumer GPU. We release all data (8300+ hours of high quality human gameplay), training and inference code, and pretrained checkpoints under an open license. We show that our best model is capable of playing a variety of 3D video games at a level competitive with human play. We use this recipe to systematically examine the scaling laws of behavior cloning to understand how the model's performance and causal reasoning varies with model and data scale. We first show in a simple toy problem that, for some types of causal reasoning, increasing both the amount of training data and the depth of the network results in the model learning a more causal policy. We then systematically study how causality varies with the number of parameters (and depth) and training steps in scaled models of up to 1.2 billion parameters, and we find similar scaling results to what we observe in the toy problem.

Abstract: While AI innovation accelerates rapidly, the intellectual process behind breakthroughs -- how researchers identify gaps, synthesize prior work, and generate insights -- remains poorly understood. The lack of structured data on scientific reasoning hinders systematic analysis and development of AI research agents. We introduce Sci-Reasoning, the first dataset capturing the intellectual synthesis behind high-quality AI research. Using community-validated quality signals and an LLM-accelerated, human-verified pipeline, we trace Oral and Spotlight papers across NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR (2023-2025) to its key predecessors, articulating specific reasoning links in a structured format. Our analysis identifies 15 distinct thinking patterns, with three dominant strategies accounting for 52.7%: Gap-Driven Reframing (24.2%), Cross-Domain Synthesis (18.0%), and Representation Shift (10.5%).

Abstract: Identifying deceptive content like phishing emails demands sophisticated cognitive processes that combine pattern recognition, confidence assessment, and contextual analysis. This research examines how human cognition and machine learning models work together to distinguish phishing emails from legitimate ones. We employed three interpretable algorithms Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests training them on both TF-IDF features and semantic embeddings, then compared their predictions against human evaluations that captured confidence ratings and linguistic observations. Our results show that machine learning models provide good accuracy rates, but their confidence levels vary significantly. Human evaluators, on the other hand, use a greater variety of language signs and retain more consistent confidence. We also found that while language proficiency has minimal effect on detection performance, aging does. These findings offer helpful direction for creating transparent AI systems that complement human cognitive functions, ultimately improving human-AI cooperation in challenging content analysis tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出将智能体改进重新定义为发布工程，介绍了一个名为AgentDevel的发布工程管道，通过将改进过程外部化，确保非回归性和可审计性，强调将智能体视为可交付工件进行管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型智能体自我改进方法常导致不稳定的改进轨迹，难以保证非回归性或跨版本故障分析，因此需要一个更系统化的工程质量管控方法。

Method: 1) 引入免实现的LLM批评器，仅依据执行痕迹描述故障表现；2) 基于脚本的可执行诊断程序，聚合主导症状模式并生成可审计的工程规范；3) 翻转中心的门控机制，将未通过至通过的回退和通过至未通过的修复作为一级证据。

Result: 在强调执行的基准测试中，AgentDevel实现了稳定的改进且显著减少了回退回归，同时生成了可复现、可审计的交付工件。

Conclusion: AgentDevel为构建、调试和发布大语言模型智能体提供了一个实用的开发规范，将其视为软件开发过程，强调版本线管理和非回归性作为核心目标。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language model (LLM) agents has largely focused on embedding self-improvement mechanisms inside the agent or searching over many concurrent variants. While these approaches can raise aggregate scores, they often yield unstable and hard-to-audit improvement trajectories, making it difficult to guarantee non-regression or to reason about failures across versions. We reframe agent improvement as \textbf{release engineering}: agents are treated as shippable artifacts, and improvement is externalized into a regression-aware release pipeline. We introduce \textbf{AgentDevel}, a release engineering pipeline that iteratively runs the current agent, produces implementation-blind, symptom-level quality signals from execution traces, synthesizes a single release candidate (RC) via executable diagnosis, and promotes it under flip-centered gating. AgentDevel features three core designs: (i) an implementation-blind LLM critic that characterizes failure appearances without accessing agent internals, (ii) script-based executable diagnosis that aggregates dominant symptom patterns and produces auditable engineering specifications, and (iii) flip-centered gating that prioritizes pass to fail regressions and fail to pass fixes as first-class evidence. Unlike population-based search or in-agent self-refinement, AgentDevel maintains a single canonical version line and emphasizes non-regression as a primary objective. Experiments on execution-heavy benchmarks demonstrate that AgentDevel yields stable improvements with significantly fewer regressions while producing reproducible, auditable artifacts. Overall, AgentDevel provides a practical development discipline for building, debugging, and releasing LLM agents as software development.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities for analyzing social phenomena at scale. This paper demonstrates the value of LLMs in psychological measurement by (1) compiling the first large-scale dataset of election rumors on a niche alt-tech platform, (2) developing a multistage Rumor Detection Agent that leverages LLMs for high-precision content classification, and (3) quantifying the psychological dynamics of rumor propagation, specifically the "illusory truth effect" in a naturalistic setting. The Rumor Detection Agent combines (i) a synthetic data-augmented, fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier, (ii) precision keyword filtering, and (iii) a two-pass LLM verification pipeline using GPT-4o mini. The findings reveal that sharing probability rises steadily with each additional exposure, providing large-scale empirical evidence for dose-response belief reinforcement in ideologically homogeneous networks. Simulation results further demonstrate rapid contagion effects: nearly one quarter of users become "infected" within just four propagation iterations. Taken together, these results illustrate how LLMs can transform psychological science by enabling the rigorous measurement of belief dynamics and misinformation spread in massive, real-world datasets.

TL;DR: Isabellm：一个基于LLM的Isabelle/HOL全自动证明合成器，在消费级计算机上运行，通过步进式证明器与高层证明规划器的双层框架实现，能证明标准自动化工具无法处理的引理，但即使最先进的LLM在复杂算法设计上仍存在可靠性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统定理证明器的自动化工具（如Isabelle的Sledgehammer）在证明复杂引理时存在局限。作者旨在开发一个基于大型语言模型的定理证明系统，以解决这些自动化工具无法处理的证明任务，并探索LLM在形式化证明中的实际应用价值。

Method: 系统结合了步进式证明器（使用LLM生成证明命令并通过Isabelle在有限搜索循环中验证）与高层证明规划器（生成结构化Isar大纲并尝试填补和修复剩余间隙）。框架包含：战术的束搜索、战术重排器（ML和RL模型）、基于小型Transformer模型的前提选择、从AFP构建的Isar证明微RAG，以及反例引导的证明修复。所有代码由GPT 4.1-5.2、Gemini 3 Pro和Claude 4.5实现。

Result: Isabellm能够证明Isabelle标准自动化工具（包括Sledgehammer）无法处理的某些引理，展示了LLM引导的证明搜索的实用价值。但同时发现，即使最先进的LLM（如GPT 5.2 Extended Thinking和Gemini 3 Pro）在实现复杂的填补-修复机制时仍存在可靠性问题，突显了LLM代码生成和推理的基本挑战。

Conclusion: Isabellm证明了LLM引导的证明搜索在定理证明中的可行性，能够处理传统自动化工具失败的案例。然而，当前LLM在复杂算法设计方面的局限性表明，完全自动化的可靠证明合成仍面临重大挑战，需要在LLM推理能力和系统设计上进一步改进。

Abstract: We present Isabellm, an LLM-powered theorem prover for Isabelle/HOL that performs fully automatic proof synthesis. Isabellm works with any local LLM on Ollama and APIs such as Gemini CLI, and it is designed to run on consumer grade computers. The system combines a stepwise prover, which uses large language models to propose proof commands validated by Isabelle in a bounded search loop, with a higher-level proof planner that generates structured Isar outlines and attempts to fill and repair remaining gaps. The framework includes beam search for tactics, tactics reranker ML and RL models, premise selection with small transformer models, micro-RAG for Isar proofs built from AFP, and counter-example guided proof repair. All the code is implemented by GPT 4.1 - 5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5. Empirically, Isabellm can prove certain lemmas that defeat Isabelle's standard automation, including Sledgehammer, demonstrating the practical value of LLM-guided proof search. At the same time, we find that even state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT 5.2 Extended Thinking and Gemini 3 Pro struggle to reliably implement the intended fill-and-repair mechanisms with complex algorithmic designs, highlighting fundamental challenges in LLM code generation and reasoning. The code of Isabellm is available at https://github.com/zhehou/llm-isabelle

Conclusion: InstruCoT 通过创新的指令级思维链微调方法，为 LLM 应用中复杂的提示注入攻击提供了有效的防御解决方案

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-integrated applications have become increasingly prevalent, yet face critical security vulnerabilities from prompt injection (PI) attacks. Defending against PI attacks faces two major issues: malicious instructions can be injected through diverse vectors, and injected instructions often lack clear semantic boundaries from the surrounding context, making them difficult to identify. To address these issues, we propose InstruCoT, a model enhancement method for PI defense that synthesizes diverse training data and employs instruction-level chain-of-thought fine-tuning, enabling LLMs to effectively identify and reject malicious instructions regardless of their source or position in the context. We evaluate InstruCoT across three critical dimensions: Behavior Deviation, Privacy Leakage, and Harmful Output. Experimental results across four LLMs demonstrate that InstruCoT significantly outperforms baselines in all dimensions while maintaining utility performance without degradation

Abstract: Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-based MAS), where multiple LLM agents collaborate to solve complex tasks, have shown impressive performance in many areas. However, MAS are typically distributed across different devices or environments, making them vulnerable to perturbations such as agent failures. While existing works have studied the adversarial attacks and corresponding defense strategies, they mainly focus on reactively detecting and mitigating attacks after they occur rather than proactively designing inherently resilient systems. In this work, we study the resilience of LLM-based MAS under perturbations and find that both the communication topology and prompt design significantly influence system resilience. Motivated by these findings, we propose ResMAS: a two-stage framework for enhancing MAS resilience. First, we train a reward model to predict the MAS's resilience, based on which we train a topology generator to automatically design resilient topology for specific tasks through reinforcement learning. Second, we introduce a topology-aware prompt optimization method that refines each agent's prompt based on its connections and interactions with other agents. Extensive experiments across a range of tasks show that our approach substantially improves MAS resilience under various constraints. Moreover, our framework demonstrates strong generalization ability to new tasks and models, highlighting its potential for building resilient MASs.

TL;DR: Tape benchmark旨在隔离潜在规则偏移下的OOD失效，基于一维元胞自动构建，保持观测和动作空间不变但改变转移规则。研究发现ID表现好的方法在OOD下可能崩溃，且OOD评估需要充分重复实验以确保稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在训练和测试分布一致（ID）时表现良好，但在规则偏移（OOD）时会出现性能崩溃。需要标准化基准和评估协议来系统性研究OOD失效问题，并澄清不确定性降低目标在规则偏移下的理论保证。

Method: 基于一维元胞自动机构建Tape benchmark，固定观测和动作空间但改变转移规则，创建精确的train/test划分。使用可复现的评估管道比较无模型基线、基于模型的世界模型规划方法和任务推断（元强化学习）方法。

Result: ID表现强的方法在保留规则的OOD测试下可能崩溃；OOD评估的高方差可能导致排名不稳定，需要充分重复实验；提供了OOD协议标准化、统计报告要求（种子数、置信区间、假设检验），以及信息论恒等式连接熵减少与条件互信息和期望后验KL散度。

Conclusion: Tape benchmark为研究强化学习中的OOD失效提供了受控环境；强调需要标准化评估协议和充分重复实验；信息论分析澄清了不确定性降低目标在规则偏移下的理论局限性，为开发更鲁棒的OOD方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present Tape, a controlled reinforcement-learning benchmark designed to isolate out-of-distribution (OOD) failure under latent rule shifts.Tape is derived from one-dimensional cellular automata, enabling precise train/test splits where observation and action spaces are held fixed while transition rules change. Using a reproducible evaluation pipeline, we compare model-free baselines, model-based planning with learned world models, and task-inference (meta-RL) methods. A consistent pattern emerges: methods that are strong in-distribution (ID) can collapse under heldout-rule OOD, and high-variance OOD evaluation can make rankings unstable unless experiments are sufficiently replicated.We provide (i) standardized OOD protocols, (ii) statistical reporting requirements (seeds, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests), and (iii) information-theoretic identities connecting entropy reduction to conditional mutual information and expected posterior KL divergence, clarifying what "uncertainty reduction" objectives can and cannot guarantee under rule shifts.

Abstract: In the process of digital transformation, enterprises are faced with problems such as insufficient semantic understanding of unstructured data and lack of intelligent decision-making basis in driving mechanisms. This study proposes a method that combines a large language model (LLM) and a knowledge graph. First, a fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model is used to perform entity recognition and relationship extraction on multi-source heterogeneous texts, and GPT-4 is used to generate semantically enhanced vector representations; secondly, a two-layer graph neural network (GNN) architecture is designed to fuse the semantic vectors output by LLM with business metadata to construct a dynamic and scalable enterprise knowledge graph; then reinforcement learning is introduced to optimize decision path generation, and the reward function is used to drive the mechanism iteration. In the case of the manufacturing industry, this mechanism reduced the response time for equipment failure scenarios from 7.8 hours to 3.7 hours, the F1 value reached 94.3%, and the compensation for decision errors in the annual digital transformation cost decreased by 45.3%. This method significantly enhances the intelligence level and execution efficiency of the digital transformation driving mechanism by integrating large model semantic understanding with structured knowledge.

Abstract: Travel planning is a sophisticated decision-making process that requires synthesizing multifaceted information to construct itineraries. However, existing travel planning approaches face several challenges: (1) Pruning candidate points of interest (POIs) while maintaining a high recall rate; (2) A single reasoning path restricts the exploration capability within the feasible solution space for travel planning; (3) Simultaneously optimizing hard constraints and soft constraints remains a significant difficulty. To address these challenges, we propose TourPlanner, a comprehensive framework featuring multi-path reasoning and constraint-gated reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first introduce a Personalized Recall and Spatial Optimization (PReSO) workflow to construct spatially-aware candidate POIs' set. Subsequently, we propose Competitive consensus Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), a multi-path reasoning paradigm that improves the ability of exploring the feasible solution space. To further refine the plan, we integrate a sigmoid-based gating mechanism into the reinforcement learning stage, which dynamically prioritizes soft-constraint satisfaction only after hard constraints are met. Experimental results on travel planning benchmarks demonstrate that TourPlanner achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing existing methods in both feasibility and user-preference alignment.

Abstract: Agentic search has emerged as a promising paradigm for complex information seeking by enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to interleave reasoning with tool use. However, prevailing systems rely on monolithic agents that suffer from structural bottlenecks, including unconstrained reasoning outputs that inflate trajectories, sparse outcome-level rewards that complicate credit assignment, and stochastic search noise that destabilizes learning. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{M-ASK} (Multi-Agent Search and Knowledge), a framework that explicitly decouples agentic search into two complementary roles: Search Behavior Agents, which plan and execute search actions, and Knowledge Management Agents, which aggregate, filter, and maintain a compact internal context. This decomposition allows each agent to focus on a well-defined subtask and reduces interference between search and context construction. Furthermore, to enable stable coordination, M-ASK employs turn-level rewards to provide granular supervision for both search decisions and knowledge updates. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that M-ASK outperforms strong baselines, achieving not only superior answer accuracy but also significantly more stable training dynamics.\footnote{The source code for M-ASK is available at https://github.com/chenyiqun/M-ASK.}

Abstract: Root cause analysis in modern cloud infrastructure demands sophisticated understanding of heterogeneous data sources, particularly time-series performance metrics that involve core failure signatures. While large language models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in textual reasoning, their discrete token-based architecture creates fundamental incompatibilities with continuous numerical sequences exhibiting temporal dependencies. Current methodologies inadequately address this modality mismatch, constraining the potential of language model-driven automation in incident management workflows. This paper presents a multimodal diagnostic framework that harmonizes time-series representations with pretrained language model embedding spaces. Our approach contributes three technical advances: (1) a semantic compression technique that distills temporal segments into single-token abstractions while preserving pattern semantics, (2) an alignment encoder utilizing gated cross-attention to project time-series features into language model latent space, and (3) a retrieval-augmented diagnostic pipeline that synthesizes aligned embeddings with historical incident knowledge for expert-level failure attribution. Comprehensive evaluation across six cloud system benchmarks demonstrates that our framework achieves leading performance, reaching 48.75% diagnostic accuracy with notable improvements on scenarios involving compound failure modes. The results validate embedding-space alignment as an effective strategy for enabling language models to reason over multimodal telemetry data in production incident response contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在自动驾驶领域的广泛应用，现有方法存在推理非结构化、泛化能力差以及与人类驾驶意图不匹配的问题。虽然思维链（CoT）推理增强了决策透明度，但传统的监督微调未能充分发挥其潜力，而强化学习方法面临不稳定和推理深度不足的挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：1）使用CoT解释进行监督微调（SFT）；2）应用渐进式强化学习（RL），配备难度感知自适应策略优化器，根据样本复杂度动态调整学习强度。该方法将显式推理与自适应策略优化相结合。

Result: 在公开数据集上的评估显示，ThinkDrive在exam、easy-exam和accuracy指标上分别比强RL基线提高1.45%、1.95%和1.01%。此外，使用该方法训练的2B参数模型在exam指标上大幅超越GPT-4o（参数量大得多）3.28%。

Conclusion: ThinkDrive通过COT引导的渐进式RL微调框架，成功地将显式推理与难度感知自适应优化相结合，在自动驾驶任务中实现了优于现有方法的性能，证明了中等规模模型通过适当训练策略可以超越更大规模模型的能力。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) technologies, their application in the domain of autonomous driving has become increasingly widespread. However, existing methods suffer from unstructured reasoning, poor generalization, and misalignment with human driving intent. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances decision transparency, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) fails to fully exploit its potential, and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches face instability and suboptimal reasoning depth. We propose ThinkDrive, a CoT guided progressive RL fine-tuning framework for autonomous driving that synergizes explicit reasoning with difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimization. Our method employs a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform SFT using CoT explanations. Then, we apply progressive RL with a difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimizer that dynamically adjusts learning intensity based on sample complexity. We evaluate our approach on a public dataset. The results show that ThinkDrive outperforms strong RL baselines by 1.45%, 1.95%, and 1.01% on exam, easy-exam, and accuracy, respectively. Moreover, a 2B-parameter model trained with our method surpasses the much larger GPT-4o by 3.28% on the exam metric.

Abstract: Current critic-free RL methods for large reasoning models suffer from severe inefficiency when training on positive homogeneous prompts (where all rollouts are correct), resulting in waste of rollouts due to zero advantage estimates. We introduce a radically simple yet powerful solution to \uline{M}ine \uline{in}trinsic mast\uline{er}y (Miner), that repurposes the policy's intrinsic uncertainty as a self-supervised reward signal, with no external supervision, auxiliary models, or additional inference cost. Our method pioneers two key innovations: (1) a token-level focal credit assignment mechanism that dynamically amplifies gradients on critical uncertain tokens while suppressing overconfident ones, and (2) adaptive advantage calibration to seamlessly integrate intrinsic and verifiable rewards. Evaluated across six reasoning benchmarks on Qwen3-4B and Qwen3-8B base models, Miner achieves state-of-the-art performance among the other four algorithms, yielding up to \textbf{4.58} absolute gains in Pass@1 and \textbf{6.66} gains in Pass@K compared to GRPO. Comparison with other methods targeted at exploration enhancement further discloses the superiority of the two newly proposed innovations. This demonstrates that latent uncertainty exploitation is both necessary and sufficient for efficient and scalable RL training of reasoning models.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective for knowledge synthesis, yet it encounters significant challenges in practical scenarios where data is inherently discrete and fragmented. In most environments, information is distributed across isolated files like reports and logs that lack explicit links. Standard search engines process files independently, ignoring the connections between them. Furthermore, manually building Knowledge Graphs is impractical for such vast data. To bridge this gap, we present Orion-RAG. Our core insight is simple yet effective: we do not need heavy algorithms to organize this data. Instead, we use a low-complexity strategy to extract lightweight paths that naturally link related concepts. We demonstrate that this streamlined approach suffices to transform fragmented documents into semi-structured data, enabling the system to link information across different files effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Orion-RAG consistently outperforms mainstream frameworks across diverse domains, supporting real-time updates and explicit Human-in-the-Loop verification with high cost-efficiency. Experiments on FinanceBench demonstrate superior precision with a 25.2% relative improvement over strong baselines.

Abstract: LLM agents have emerged as powerful systems for tackling multi-turn tasks by interleaving internal reasoning and external tool interactions. Agentic Reinforcement Learning has recently drawn significant research attention as a critical post-training paradigm to further refine these capabilities. In this paper, we present AT$^2$PO (Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization via Tree Search), a unified framework for multi-turn agentic RL that addresses three core challenges: limited exploration diversity, sparse credit assignment, and misaligned policy optimization. AT$^2$PO introduces a turn-level tree structure that jointly enables Entropy-Guided Tree Expansion for strategic exploration and Turn-wise Credit Assignment for fine-grained reward propagation from sparse outcomes. Complementing this, we propose Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization, a turn-level learning objective that aligns policy updates with the natural decision granularity of agentic interactions. ATPO is orthogonal to tree search and can be readily integrated into any multi-turn RL pipeline. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline by up to 1.84 percentage points in average, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component.

Abstract: Designing academic posters is a labor-intensive process requiring the precise balance of high-density content and sophisticated layout. While existing paper-to-poster generation methods automate initial drafting, they are typically single-pass and non-interactive, often fail to align with complex, subjective user intent. To bridge this gap, we propose APEX (Academic Poster Editing agentic eXpert), the first agentic framework for interactive academic poster editing, supporting fine-grained control with robust multi-level API-based editing and a review-and-adjustment Mechanism. In addition, we introduce APEX-Bench, the first systematic benchmark comprising 514 academic poster editing instructions, categorized by a multi-dimensional taxonomy including operation type, difficulty, and abstraction level, constructed via reference-guided and reference-free strategies to ensure realism and diversity. We further establish a multi-dimensional VLM-as-a-judge evaluation protocol to assess instruction fulfillment, modification scope, and visual consistency & harmony. Experimental results demonstrate that APEX significantly outperforms baseline methods. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Breesiu/APEX.

To address this overthinking problem, existing work focuses on using reinforcement learning (RL) to train hybrid reasoning models that automatically decide whether to engage in thinking or not based on the complexity of the query. Unfortunately, using RL will suffer the the reward hacking problem, e.g., the model engages in thinking but is judged as not doing so, resulting in incorrect rewards. To mitigate this problem, existing works either employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which incurs high computational costs, or enforce uniform token limits on non-thinking responses, which yields limited mitigation of the problem. In this paper, we propose Thinking-Based Non-Thinking (TNT). It does not employ SFT, and sets different maximum token usage for responses not using thinking across various queries by leveraging information from the solution component of the responses using thinking. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that TNT reduces token usage by around 50% compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B/7B and DeepScaleR-1.5B, while significantly improving accuracy. In fact, TNT achieves the optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among all tested methods. Additionally, the probability of reward hacking problem in TNT's responses, which are classified as not using thinking, remains below 10% across all tested datasets.

*Caijun Xu,Changyi Xiao,Zhongyuan Peng,Xinrun Wang,Yixin Cao*

TL;DR: 本文提出了SCALER框架，通过自适应环境设计为大型语言模型的推理能力提供持续有效的强化学习训练信号


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于数据集的强化学习方法有效性受限，当任务难度与模型能力不匹配时训练信号变得稀疏，或训练被狭窄的问题模式主导时容易过拟合

Method: SCALER框架包含：1）可扩展的合成流水线，将真实世界编程问题转化为可验证的推理环境；2）自适应多环境强化学习策略，动态调整实例难度并编排环境集合

Result: 实验显示SCALER在多样化推理基准上持续优于基于数据集的强化学习基线，并展现出更稳定、更长期的训练动态

Conclusion: SCALER通过自适应的环境设计与模型能力的协同适应，能够克服传统强化学习在模型推理能力训练中的局限性，提供持续有效的学习信号

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled way to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models, yet its effectiveness hinges on training signals that remain informative as models evolve. In practice, RL progress often slows when task difficulty becomes poorly aligned with model capability, or when training is dominated by a narrow set of recurring problem patterns. To jointly address these issues, we propose SCALER (Synthetic sCalable Adaptive Learning Environment for Reasoning), a framework that sustains effective learning signals through adaptive environment design. SCALER introduces a scalable synthesis pipeline that converts real-world programming problems into verifiable reasoning environments with controllable difficulty and unbounded instance generation, enabling RL training beyond finite datasets while preserving strong correctness guarantees. Building on this, SCALER further employs an adaptive multi-environment RL strategy that dynamically adjusts instance difficulty and curates the active set of environments to track the model's capability frontier and maintain distributional diversity. This co-adaptation prevents reward sparsity, mitigates overfitting to narrow task patterns, and supports sustained improvement throughout training. Extensive experiments show that SCALER consistently outperforms dataset-based RL baselines across diverse reasoning benchmarks and exhibits more stable, long-horizon training dynamics.

TL;DR: 该研究展示了AECV-Bench基准测试，用于评估多模态模型在建筑、工程和施工领域的图纸解释能力，显示当前模型在文字提取方面表现良好，但在符号识别和空间推理上存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究尚不清楚现代多模态和视觉语言模型能否可靠地解读AEC图纸中的图形语言，因此需要建立一个评估此类模型在真实AEC构件上表现的基准。

Method: 提出AECV-Bench基准，包含两个互补用例：1)在120张高质量平面图上进行对象计数；2)基于192个问答对的图纸文档问答，测试OCR、实例计数、空间推理和比较推理能力。

Result: 评估显示：文字相关任务表现最佳（准确率高达0.95），空间推理中等，而符号相关的图纸理解——特别是门窗计数——准确率仅0.40-0.55，存在显著比例误差。

Conclusion: 当前系统可作为文档助手，但缺乏扎实的图纸解读能力，需要开发领域特定表征和工具增强的人类参与工作流程，以实现高效的AEC自动化。

Abstract: AEC drawings encode geometry and semantics through symbols, layout conventions, and dense annotation, yet it remains unclear whether modern multimodal and vision-language models can reliably interpret this graphical language. We present AECV-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal and vision-language models on realistic AEC artefacts via two complementary use cases: (i) object counting on 120 high-quality floor plans (doors, windows, bedrooms, toilets), and (ii) drawing-grounded document QA spanning 192 question-answer pairs that test text extraction (OCR), instance counting, spatial reasoning, and comparative reasoning over common drawing regions. Object-counting performance is reported using per-field exact-match accuracy and MAPE results, while document-QA performance is reported using overall accuracy and per-category breakdowns with an LLM-as-a-judge scoring pipeline and targeted human adjudication for edge cases. Evaluating a broad set of state-of-the-art models under a unified protocol, we observe a stable capability gradient; OCR and text-centric document QA are strongest (up to 0.95 accuracy), spatial reasoning is moderate, and symbol-centric drawing understanding - especially reliable counting of doors and windows - remains unsolved (often 0.40-0.55 accuracy) with substantial proportional errors. These results suggest that current systems function well as document assistants but lack robust drawing literacy, motivating domain-specific representations and tool-augmented, human-in-the-loop workflows for an efficient AEC automation.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a prominent paradigm for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs). Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA, is widely adopted to adapt pretrained MoE LLMs to downstream tasks. However, existing approaches assign identical LoRA ranks to all experts, overlooking the intrinsic functional specialization within MoE LLMs. This uniform allocation leads to resource mismatch, task-relevant experts are under-provisioned while less relevant ones receive redundant parameters. We propose a Dynamic Rank LoRA framework named DR-LoRA, which dynamically grows expert LoRA ranks during fine-tuning based on task-specific demands. DR-LoRA employs an Expert Saliency Scoring mechanism that integrates expert routing frequency and LoRA rank importance to quantify each expert's demand for additional capacity. Experts with higher saliency scores are prioritized for rank expansion, enabling the automatic formation of a heterogeneous rank distribution tailored to the target task. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DR-LoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA and static allocation strategies under the same parameter budget, achieving superior task performance with more efficient parameter utilization.

Abstract: Continual learning aims to enable models to acquire new knowledge while retaining previously learned information. Prompt-based methods have shown remarkable performance in this domain; however, they typically rely on key-value pairing, which can introduce inter-task interference and hinder scalability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach employing task-specific Prompt-Prototype (ProP), thereby eliminating the need for key-value pairs. In our method, task-specific prompts facilitate more effective feature learning for the current task, while corresponding prototypes capture the representative features of the input. During inference, predictions are generated by binding each task-specific prompt with its associated prototype. Additionally, we introduce regularization constraints during prompt initialization to penalize excessively large values, thereby enhancing stability. Experiments on several widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In contrast to mainstream prompt-based approaches, our framework removes the dependency on key-value pairs, offering a fresh perspective for future continual learning research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强语言模型缺乏结构性深度，传统知识图谱的成对约束无法捕捉控制涌现物理行为的不可约高阶交互，限制了科学推理能力。为解决这一问题，需要开发能够忠实编码多实体关系的知识表示方法。

Method: 构建超图知识表示：将多实体关系编码为超边，应用至约1,100篇生物复合材料支架文献，建立全局超图（161,172节点，320,201超边）；开发配备超图遍历工具（特别是节点交集约束）的智能体系统，利用超图拓扑结构进行推理。

Result: 构建的全局超图呈现无标度拓扑结构（幂律指数~1.23），围绕高度连通的概念枢纽组织；超图表示避免了成对扩展的组合爆炸问题；系统能够利用高阶路径桥接语义遥远概念，成功生成具有基础机制假设的新复合材料方案（如通过壳聚糖中间体将氧化铈与PCL支架关联）。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了无教师智能推理系统，其中超图拓扑结构作为可验证的护栏，通过揭示传统图方法所遮蔽的关系来加速科学发现。超图形知识表示为科学推理提供了更忠实表达复杂相互作用的基础框架。

Abstract: Scientific inquiry requires systems-level reasoning that integrates heterogeneous experimental data, cross-domain knowledge, and mechanistic evidence into coherent explanations. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer inferential capabilities, they often depend on retrieval-augmented contexts that lack structural depth. Traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) attempt to bridge this gap, yet their pairwise constraints fail to capture the irreducible higher-order interactions that govern emergent physical behavior. To address this, we introduce a methodology for constructing hypergraph-based knowledge representations that faithfully encode multi-entity relationships. Applied to a corpus of ~1,100 manuscripts on biocomposite scaffolds, our framework constructs a global hypergraph of 161,172 nodes and 320,201 hyperedges, revealing a scale-free topology (power law exponent ~1.23) organized around highly connected conceptual hubs. This representation prevents the combinatorial explosion typical of pairwise expansions and explicitly preserves the co-occurrence context of scientific formulations. We further demonstrate that equipping agentic systems with hypergraph traversal tools, specifically using node-intersection constraints, enables them to bridge semantically distant concepts. By exploiting these higher-order pathways, the system successfully generates grounded mechanistic hypotheses for novel composite materials, such as linking cerium oxide to PCL scaffolds via chitosan intermediates. This work establishes a "teacherless" agentic reasoning system where hypergraph topology acts as a verifiable guardrail, accelerating scientific discovery by uncovering relationships obscured by traditional graph methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Executing a multi-agent plan can be challenging when an agent is delayed, because this typically creates conflicts with other agents. So, we need to quickly find a new safe plan. Replanning only the delayed agent often does not result in an efficient plan, and sometimes cannot even yield a feasible plan. On the other hand, replanning other agents may lead to a cascade of changes and delays. We show how to efficiently replan by tracking and using the temporal flexibility of other agents while avoiding cascading delays. This flexibility is the maximum delay an agent can take without changing the order of or further delaying more agents. Our algorithm, FlexSIPP, precomputes all possible plans for the delayed agent, also returning the changes for the other agents, for any single-agent delay within the given scenario. We demonstrate our method in a real-world case study of replanning trains in the densely-used Dutch railway network. Our experiments show that FlexSIPP provides effective solutions, relevant to real-world adjustments, and within a reasonable timeframe.

Abstract: Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) are pivotal in optimizing production processes in today's rapidly evolving manufacturing landscape. This paper advances the traditional job shop scheduling problem by incorporating additional complexities through the simultaneous integration of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and tool-sharing systems. We propose a novel approach that combines Colored-Timed Petri Nets (CTPNs) with actor-critic model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), effectively addressing the multifaceted challenges associated with FMS. CTPNs provide a formal modeling structure and dynamic action masking, significantly reducing the action search space, while MBRL ensures adaptability to changing environments through the learned policy. Leveraging the advantages of MBRL, we incorporate a lookahead strategy for optimal positioning of AGVs, improving operational efficiency. Our approach was evaluated on small-sized public benchmarks and a newly developed large-scale benchmark inspired by the Taillard benchmark. The results show that our approach matches traditional methods on smaller instances and outperforms them on larger ones in terms of makespan while achieving a tenfold reduction in computation time. To ensure reproducibility, we propose a gym-compatible environment and an instance generator. Additionally, an ablation study evaluates the contribution of each framework component to its overall performance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is increasingly confounded by \emph{variant contamination}: the training corpus contains semantically equivalent yet lexically or syntactically altered versions of test items. Unlike verbatim leakage, these paraphrased or structurally transformed variants evade existing detectors based on sampling consistency or perplexity, thereby inflating benchmark scores via memorization rather than genuine reasoning. We formalize this problem and introduce \textbf{DVD} (\textbf{D}etection via \textbf{V}ariance of generation \textbf{D}istribution), a single-sample detector that models the local output distribution induced by temperature sampling. Our key insight is that contaminated items trigger alternation between a \emph{memory-adherence} state and a \emph{perturbation-drift} state, yielding abnormally high variance in the synthetic difficulty of low-probability tokens; uncontaminated items remain in drift with comparatively smooth variance. We construct the first benchmark for variant contamination across two domains Omni-MATH and SuperGPQA by generating and filtering semantically equivalent variants, and simulate contamination via fine-tuning models of different scales and architectures (Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1). Across datasets and models, \textbf{DVD} consistently outperforms perplexity-based, Min-$k$\%++, edit-distance (CDD), and embedding-similarity baselines, while exhibiting strong robustness to hyperparameters. Our results establish variance of the generation distribution as a principled and practical fingerprint for detecting variant contamination in LLM evaluation.

Abstract: The primary objective of a diverse planning approach is to generate a set of plans that are distinct from one another. Such an approach is applied in a variety of real-world domains, including risk management, automated stream data analysis, and malware detection. More recently, a novel diverse planning paradigm, referred to as behaviour planning, has been proposed. This approach extends earlier methods by explicitly incorporating a diversity model into the planning process and supporting multiple planning categories. In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of behaviour planning in real-world settings by presenting three case studies. The first case study focuses on storytelling, the second addresses urban planning, and the third examines game evaluation.

Motivation: 学习分析仪表板虽然旨在通过数据反馈支持学生学习，但学生特别是自我调节学习能力较低的学生往往难以有效解释数据反馈。研究探索将生成式AI助手集成到仪表板中，通过对话式支持来为学生提供个性化学习支架。

Method: 研究在为期10周的学期中，收集分析学生与集成在学习分析仪表板中的生成式AI助手之间的真实对话。分析关注：不同SRL水平学生的提问类型、助手回答的相关性与质量、学生对助手在学习中角色的认知。

Result: 发现不同SRL水平学生提问模式差异显著：低SRL学生寻求澄清和安慰，高SRL学生询问技术细节和个性化策略。AI助手能提供清晰可靠解释但存在三大局限：个性化不足、情感查询处理有限、多数据点整合困难。生成式AI干预对低SRL学生特别有价值，能缩小与高SRL学生的差距。学生反馈强调了对信任、适应性、上下文感知和技术精炼的需求。

Conclusion: 生成式AI助手在学习分析反馈中具有重要价值，特别是对SRL能力较低的学生。需要提高AI系统的自适应能力、上下文意识和个性化响应能力，同时建立用户信任并改进技术实现，以实现更有效的学习支持。

Abstract: Learning analytics dashboards (LADs) aim to support students' regulation of learning by translating complex data into feedback. Yet students, especially those with lower self-regulated learning (SRL) competence, often struggle to engage with and interpret analytics feedback. Conversational generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) assistants have shown potential to scaffold this process through real-time, personalised, dialogue-based support. Further advancing this potential, we explored authentic dialogues between students and GenAI assistant integrated into LAD during a 10-week semester. The analysis focused on questions students with different SRL levels posed, the relevance and quality of the assistant's answers, and how students perceived the assistant's role in their learning. Findings revealed distinct query patterns. While low SRL students sought clarification and reassurance, high SRL students queried technical aspects and requested personalised strategies. The assistant provided clear and reliable explanations but limited in personalisation, handling emotionally charged queries, and integrating multiple data points for tailored responses. Findings further extend that GenAI interventions can be especially valuable for low SRL students, offering scaffolding that supports engagement with feedback and narrows gaps with their higher SRL peers. At the same time, students' reflections underscored the importance of trust, need for greater adaptivity, context-awareness, and technical refinement in future systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as coding partners, yet their role in accelerating scientific discovery remains underexplored. This paper presents a case study of using ChatGPT for rapid prototyping in ESA's ELOPE (Event-based Lunar OPtical flow Egomotion estimation) competition. The competition required participants to process event camera data to estimate lunar lander trajectories. Despite joining late, we achieved second place with a score of 0.01282, highlighting the potential of human-AI collaboration in competitive scientific settings. ChatGPT contributed not only executable code but also algorithmic reasoning, data handling routines, and methodological suggestions, such as using fixed number of events instead of fixed time spans for windowing. At the same time, we observed limitations: the model often introduced unnecessary structural changes, gets confused by intermediate discussions about alternative ideas, occasionally produced critical errors and forgets important aspects in longer scientific discussions. By analyzing these strengths and shortcomings, we show how conversational AI can both accelerate development and support conceptual insight in scientific research. We argue that structured integration of LLMs into the scientific workflow can enhance rapid prototyping by proposing best practices for AI-assisted scientific work.

Motivation: 当前基于图的RAG方法在处理层次信息时存在两个关键局限性：刚性层特定压缩配额损害了局部图结构，以及过度关注拓扑结构而忽略了语义内容。需要一种能够同时保持图自然层次组织和语义一致性的新方法。

Method: 提出T-Retriever框架，包含两个关键创新：1) 自适应压缩编码，用全局优化策略取代人工压缩配额；2) 语义结构熵(S²-Entropy)，在创建层次分区时同时优化结构凝聚力和语义一致性。该方法将属性图检索重新表述为基于语义和结构引导编码树的树基检索。

Result: 在多个图推理基准测试中，T-Retriever显著优于最先进的RAG方法，为复杂查询提供更加连贯和上下文相关的回答。

Conclusion: T-Retriever通过结合结构引导和语义感知的层次编码，有效解决了图基RAG在层次信息管理中的局限性，为外部知识检索提供了更加优化的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly enhanced Large Language Models' ability to access external knowledge, yet current graph-based RAG approaches face two critical limitations in managing hierarchical information: they impose rigid layer-specific compression quotas that damage local graph structures, and they prioritize topological structure while neglecting semantic content. We introduce T-Retriever, a novel framework that reformulates attributed graph retrieval as tree-based retrieval using a semantic and structure-guided encoding tree. Our approach features two key innovations: (1) Adaptive Compression Encoding, which replaces artificial compression quotas with a global optimization strategy that preserves the graph's natural hierarchical organization, and (2) Semantic-Structural Entropy ($S^2$-Entropy), which jointly optimizes for both structural cohesion and semantic consistency when creating hierarchical partitions. Experiments across diverse graph reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that T-Retriever significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG methods, providing more coherent and contextually relevant responses to complex queries.

TL;DR: ConMax通过强化学习框架自动压缩思维链推理轨迹，在保持推理质量的同时显著减少冗余，提高训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）通过扩展思维链（CoT）生成实现复杂认知行为，但常导致“过度思考”问题——生成冗余推理路径增加计算成本却不提升准确率。虽然对推理轨迹进行监督微调是标准的“冷启动”方法，但现有压缩技术往往会损害逻辑连贯性或产生过高的采样成本。

Method: 提出ConMax（置信度最大化压缩）强化学习框架，将压缩建模为奖励驱动的优化问题，训练策略修剪冗余。最大化加权组合：答案置信度（预测保真度）和思维置信度（通过冻结的辅助LRM评估推理有效性）。该框架自动学习压缩推理轨迹，同时保持必要的推理模式。

Result: 在五个推理数据集上的大量实验表明，ConMax实现了优越的效率-性能平衡。具体而言，在准确率仅下降0.7%的情况下，相比强基线将推理长度减少了43%，证明其能高效生成LRMs的高质量训练数据。

Conclusion: ConMax通过强化学习驱动的压缩框架，有效解决了大型推理模型中的过度思考问题，在保持推理质量的同时显著提高计算效率，为高效生成高质量训练数据提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated that extensive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation is critical for enabling intricate cognitive behaviors, such as self-verification and backtracking, to solve complex tasks. However, this capability often leads to ``overthinking'', where models generate redundant reasoning paths that inflate computational costs without improving accuracy. While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on reasoning traces is a standard paradigm for the 'cold start' phase, applying existing compression techniques to these traces often compromises logical coherence or incurs prohibitive sampling costs. In this paper, we introduce ConMax (Confidence-Maximizing Compression), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to automatically compress reasoning traces while preserving essential reasoning patterns. ConMax formulates compression as a reward-driven optimization problem, training a policy to prune redundancy by maximizing a weighted combination of answer confidence for predictive fidelity and thinking confidence for reasoning validity through a frozen auxiliary LRM. Extensive experiments across five reasoning datasets demonstrate that ConMax achieves a superior efficiency-performance trade-off. Specifically, it reduces inference length by 43% over strong baselines at the cost of a mere 0.7% dip in accuracy, proving its effectiveness in generating high-quality, efficient training data for LRMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法推理基准有限，无法回答'大型推理模型是否真正掌握算法推理'这一关键问题。随着模型在MATH500等基准上取得显著进展，算法推理领域的评估仍需要更全面的基准来深入诊断模型能力。

Method: 设计了AlgBench基准，包含超过3000个由ACM算法专家原创设计的题目，涵盖27种算法，采用全面分类体系（欧几里得结构化、非欧几里得结构化、非优化、局部优化、全局优化、启发式优化）。对Gemini-3-Pro、DeepSeek-v3.2-Speciale、GPT-o3等领先模型进行实证评估。

Result: 实验结果显示模型表现存在显著的异质性：非优化任务上准确率高达92%，但在动态规划等全局优化算法上准确率急剧下降至约49%。分析发现模型存在'策略过转移'现象，即由于必要的低熵标记而提前放弃正确的算法设计。

Conclusion: 现有基于问题中心的强化学习存在根本局限性，强调需要采用以算法为中心的训练范式来获得鲁棒的算法推理能力。AlgBench基准揭示了大型推理模型在算法推理方面的深层缺陷，为未来研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Reasoning ability has become a central focus in the advancement of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Although notable progress has been achieved on several reasoning benchmarks such as MATH500 and LiveCodeBench, existing benchmarks for algorithmic reasoning remain limited, failing to answer a critical question: Do LRMs truly master algorithmic reasoning? To answer this question, we propose AlgBench, an expert-curated benchmark that evaluates LRMs under an algorithm-centric paradigm.
  AlgBench consists of over 3,000 original problems spanning 27 algorithms, constructed by ACM algorithmic experts and organized under a comprehensive taxonomy, including Euclidean-structured, non-Euclidean-structured, non-optimized, local-optimized, global-optimized, and heuristic-optimized categories. Empirical evaluations on leading LRMs (e.g., Gemini-3-Pro, DeepSeek-v3.2-Speciale and GPT-o3) reveal substantial performance heterogeneity: while models perform well on non-optimized tasks (up to 92%), accuracy drops sharply to around 49% on globally optimized algorithms such as dynamic programming. Further analysis uncovers \textbf{strategic over-shifts}, wherein models prematurely abandon correct algorithmic designs due to necessary low-entropy tokens. These findings expose fundamental limitations of problem-centric reinforcement learning and highlight the necessity of an algorithm-centric training paradigm for robust algorithmic reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索大型语言模型在应对表格数据表示中的语义和结构扭曲时的局限性和失败模式，了解模型是否具备自主检测和纠正表格扭曲的能力，以及如何改进模型对表格数据的理解。

Method: 研究方法包括创建一个专家策划的小型数据集，专门评估LLM在表格问答任务中的表现，这些任务需要在分析前进行错误纠正步骤。通过系统提示为模型提供显式先验，观察模型在扭曲表格数据下的推理策略变化。

Result: 研究结果显示，LLM在扭曲的表格数据下表现出系统性的信息处理差异，即使是GPT-5.2等最先进模型的准确率也至少下降22%。模型只有在获得显式系统提示时才能部分纠正一些扭曲，但这种纠正既不系统也不完整。

Conclusion: LLM缺乏自主检测和纠正表格数据扭曲的内在能力，这引发了关于模型何时以及如何能够像人类一样自主对齐表格输入的重要问题，而不依赖显式提示或表格数据预处理。

Abstract: We investigate how large language models (LLMs) fail when tabular data in an otherwise canonical representation is subjected to semantic and structural distortions. Our findings reveal that LLMs lack an inherent ability to detect and correct subtle distortions in table representations. Only when provided with an explicit prior, via a system prompt, do models partially adjust their reasoning strategies and correct some distortions, though not consistently or completely. To study this phenomenon, we introduce a small, expert-curated dataset that explicitly evaluates LLMs on table question answering (TQA) tasks requiring an additional error-correction step prior to analysis. Our results reveal systematic differences in how LLMs ingest and interpret tabular information under distortion, with even SoTA models such as GPT-5.2 model exhibiting a drop of minimum 22% accuracy under distortion. These findings raise important questions for future research, particularly regarding when and how models should autonomously decide to realign tabular inputs, analogous to human behavior, without relying on explicit prompts or tabular data pre-processing.

TL;DR: OptiSet是通过集中心框架统一集合选择与集合级排序的RAG方法，采用'扩展-精炼'范式从多视角获取候选池并重新选择形成紧凑证据集，使用自合成策略识别互补与冗余证据，通过集合列表化训练联合优化选择与排序，提升生成效率与性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法大多基于静态选择Top-k段落，仅考虑个体相关性而无法利用段落间的组合增益，且常引入大量冗余。需要一种能够考虑证据集整体效用、识别互补与冗余关系的系统性方法来提升检索增强生成的质量与效率

Method: 1) '扩展-精炼'范式：先通过多视角扩展查询获取多样候选池，然后重新选择形成紧凑证据集；2) 自我合成策略：从生成器的集合条件效用变化推导偏好标签，无需强LLM监督即可识别互补与冗余证据；3) 集合列表化训练：联合优化集合选择与集合级排序，使模型偏好紧凑高增益的证据集

Result: 实验表明，OptiSet在复杂组合问题上提升了性能，并使生成更加高效。该方法能够减少冗余并利用组合增益，改善了检索增强生成的整体质量

Conclusion: 提出的集中心框架OptiSet有效地解决了RAG中传统的静态Top-k选择方法的局限性，通过考虑证据集的整体效用和相互依赖性，实现了更高效、更高质量的生成，且无需强监督即可识别互补与冗余关系，是一种系统性的改进方案

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves generation quality by incorporating evidence retrieved from large external corpora. However, most existing methods rely on statically selecting top-k passages based on individual relevance, which fails to exploit combinatorial gains among passages and often introduces substantial redundancy. To address this limitation, we propose OptiSet, a set-centric framework that unifies set selection and set-level ranking for RAG. OptiSet adopts an "Expand-then-Refine" paradigm: it first expands a query into multiple perspectives to enable a diverse candidate pool and then refines the candidate pool via re-selection to form a compact evidence set. We then devise a self-synthesis strategy without strong LLM supervision to derive preference labels from the set conditional utility changes of the generator, thereby identifying complementary and redundant evidence. Finally, we introduce a set-list wise training strategy that jointly optimizes set selection and set-level ranking, enabling the model to favor compact, high-gain evidence sets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiSet improves performance on complex combinatorial problems and makes generation more efficient. The source code is publicly available.

Abstract: The concept of Critical Batch Size, as pioneered by OpenAI, has long served as a foundational principle for large-scale pre-training. However, with the paradigm shift towards the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler, we observe that the original theoretical framework and its underlying mechanisms fail to align with new pre-training dynamics. To bridge this gap between theory and practice, this paper derives a revised E(S) relationship tailored for WSD scheduler, characterizing the trade-off between training data consumption E and steps S during pre-training. Our theoretical analysis reveals two fundamental properties of WSD-based pre-training: 1) B_min, the minimum batch size threshold required to achieve a target loss, and 2) B_opt, the optimal batch size that maximizes data efficiency by minimizing total tokens. Building upon these properties, we propose a dynamic Batch Size Scheduler. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our revised formula precisely captures the dynamics of large-scale pre-training, and the resulting scheduling strategy significantly enhances both training efficiency and final model quality.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了学习率优化的两种范式（Fitting和Transfer），针对大规模预训练中学习率配置的挑战。通过引入搜索因子的缩放定律和扩展μTransfer到MoE架构，降低了搜索复杂度，并分析了大尺度下模块级参数调优的性能限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模预训练中学习率配置是一个关键但棘手的挑战，需要在训练成本和模型性能之间权衡。核心研究问题是：是否可以从低成本实验中准确外推最优学习率？

Method: 提出两种研究范式：Fitting范式通过引入搜索因子的缩放定律，将搜索复杂度从O(n³)降低到O(n*C_D*C_η)；Transfer范式将μTransfer原则扩展到MoE架构，涵盖模型深度、权重衰减和token范围。在大规模超参数研究框架下对两种范式进行全面比较和分析。

Result: 实证结果表明广泛采用的μTransfer在大规模预训练场景中的可扩展性有限。通过训练稳定性和特征学习的双重视角分析，阐明了模块级参数调优在大规模设置中表现不佳的根本原因。

Conclusion: 本研究为工业级预训练优化提供了系统的实践指导和新的理论视角，挑战了当前主流超参数迁移方法的可扩展性假设，并为大规模模型训练的超参数配置提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimal configuration of the learning rate (LR) is a fundamental yet formidable challenge in large-scale pre-training. Given the stringent trade-off between training costs and model performance, the pivotal question is whether the optimal LR can be accurately extrapolated from low-cost experiments. In this paper, we formalize this investigation into two distinct research paradigms: Fitting and Transfer. Within the Fitting Paradigm, we innovatively introduce a Scaling Law for search factor, effectively reducing the search complexity from O(n^3) to O(n*C_D*C_η) via predictive modeling. Within the Transfer Paradigm, we extend the principles of $μ$Transfer to the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, broadening its applicability to encompass model depth, weight decay, and token horizons. By pushing the boundaries of existing hyperparameter research in terms of scale, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between these two paradigms. Our empirical results challenge the scalability of the widely adopted $μ$ Transfer in large-scale pre-training scenarios. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous analysis through the dual lenses of training stability and feature learning to elucidate the underlying reasons why module-wise parameter tuning underperforms in large-scale settings. This work offers systematic practical guidelines and a fresh theoretical perspective for optimizing industrial-level pre-training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to be persuasive across a variety of context. But it remains unclear whether this persuasive power advantages truth over falsehood, or if LLMs can promote misbeliefs just as easily as refuting them. Here, we investigate this question across three pre-registered experiments in which participants (N = 2,724 Americans) discussed a conspiracy theory they were uncertain about with GPT-4o, and the model was instructed to either argue against ("debunking") or for ("bunking") that conspiracy. When using a "jailbroken" GPT-4o variant with guardrails removed, the AI was as effective at increasing conspiracy belief as decreasing it. Concerningly, the bunking AI was rated more positively, and increased trust in AI, more than the debunking AI. Surprisingly, we found that using standard GPT-4o produced very similar effects, such that the guardrails imposed by OpenAI did little to revent the LLM from promoting conspiracy beliefs. Encouragingly, however, a corrective conversation reversed these newly induced conspiracy beliefs, and simply prompting GPT-4o to only use accurate information dramatically reduced its ability to increase conspiracy beliefs. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs possess potent abilities to promote both truth and falsehood, but that potential solutions may exist to help mitigate this risk.

Motivation: 材料科学综述的关键见解通常被困在叙事文本和静态PDF表格中，限制了人类和机器的重复利用。本文旨在探索如何将这些知识转化为结构化、可查询的FAIR数据，并比较不同查询方法的有效性

Method: 以原子层沉积和刻蚀（ALD/E）为案例研究，将综述表格发布为ORKG中的机器可操作性比较数据；对比ORKG的符號查询与基于大语言模型的查询方法

Result: 成功实现了综述知识的FAIR化转换，创建了结构化、可查询的知识库；通过对比分析发现符號化层应作为可靠神经符号AI的骨干，LLM更适合作为符號化基础的补充接口

Conclusion: 在材料科学中，精心策划的符號化层应作为可靠神经符号AI的基础架构，而大语言模型更适合作为基于符號化知识的补充接口，而不是独立的真相来源。FAIR化的知识转换能显著提升科学知识的可重用性和查询效率

Abstract: Scientific reviews are central to knowledge integration in materials science, yet their key insights remain locked in narrative text and static PDF tables, limiting reuse by humans and machines alike. This article presents a case study in atomic layer deposition and etching (ALD/E) where we publish review tables as FAIR, machine-actionable comparisons in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), turning them into structured, queryable knowledge. Building on this, we contrast symbolic querying over ORKG with large language model-based querying, and argue that a curated symbolic layer should remain the backbone of reliable neurosymbolic AI in materials science, with LLMs serving as complementary, symbolically grounded interfaces rather than standalone sources of truth.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in enhancing the reasoning of large language models (LLMs). Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based extensions improve upon vanilla RLVR (e.g., GRPO) by providing tree-based reasoning rollouts that enable fine-grained and segment-level credit assignment. However, existing methods still suffer from limited exploration diversity and inefficient reasoning. To address the above challenges, we propose reinforced efficient reasoning via semantically diverse explorations, i.e., ROSE, for LLMs. To encourage more diverse reasoning exploration, our method incorporates a semantic-entropy-based branching strategy and an $\varepsilon$-exploration mechanism. The former operates on already sampled reasoning rollouts to capture semantic uncertainty and select branching points with high semantic divergence to generate new successive reasoning paths, whereas the latter stochastically initiates reasoning rollouts from the root, preventing the search process from becoming overly local. To improve efficiency, we design a length-aware segment-level advantage estimator that rewards concise and correct reasoning while penalizing unnecessarily long reasoning chains. Extensive experiments on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Qwen and Llama models validate the effectiveness and efficiency of ROSE. Codes are available at https://github.com/ZiqiZhao1/ROSE-rl.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) improve performance, reliability, and interpretability by generating explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, but this transparency introduces a serious privacy risk: intermediate reasoning often leaks personally identifiable information (PII) even when final answers are sanitized. We study how to induce privacy-first reasoning, where models reason without exposing sensitive information, using deployable interventions rather than post-hoc redaction. We introduce PII-CoT-Bench, a supervised dataset with privacy-aware CoT annotations, and a category-balanced evaluation benchmark covering realistic and adversarial leakage scenarios. Our results reveal a capability-dependent trend: state-of-the-art models benefit most from prompt-based controls, whereas weaker models require fine-tuning to achieve meaningful leakage reduction. Across models and categories, both approaches substantially reduce PII exposure with minimal degradation in utility, demonstrating that private reasoning can be achieved without sacrificing performance. Overall, we show that private CoT reasoning can be achieved with minimal utility loss, providing practical guidance for building privacy-preserving reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now integral to numerous industries, increasingly serving as the core reasoning engine for autonomous agents that perform complex tasks through tool-use. While the development of Arabic-native LLMs is accelerating, the benchmarks for evaluating their capabilities lag behind, with most existing frameworks focusing on English. A critical and overlooked area is tool-calling, where the performance of models prompted in non-English languages like Arabic is poorly understood, especially since these models are often pretrained on predominantly English data. This paper addresses this critical gap by introducing the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating the tool-calling and agentic capabilities of LLMs in the Arabic language. Our work provides a standardized framework to measure the functional accuracy and robustness of models in Arabic agentic workflows. Our findings reveal a huge performance gap: when users interact in Arabic, tool-calling accuracy drops by an average of 5-10\%, regardless of whether the tool descriptions themselves are in Arabic or English. By shedding light on these critical challenges, this benchmark aims to foster the development of more reliable and linguistically equitable AI agents for Arabic-speaking users.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strengths across diverse domains. However, achieving strong performance across these domains with a single general-purpose model typically requires scaling to sizes that are prohibitively expensive to train and deploy. On the other hand, while smaller domain-specialized models are much more efficient, they struggle to generalize beyond their training distributions. To address this dilemma, we propose FusionRoute, a robust and effective token-level multi-LLM collaboration framework in which a lightweight router simultaneously (i) selects the most suitable expert at each decoding step and (ii) contributes a complementary logit that refines or corrects the selected expert's next-token distribution via logit addition. Unlike existing token-level collaboration methods that rely solely on fixed expert outputs, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that pure expert-only routing is fundamentally limited: unless strong global coverage assumptions hold, it cannot in general realize the optimal decoding policy. By augmenting expert selection with a trainable complementary generator, FusionRoute expands the effective policy class and enables recovery of optimal value functions under mild conditions. Empirically, across both Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families and diverse benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, and instruction following, FusionRoute outperforms both sequence- and token-level collaboration, model merging, and direct fine-tuning, while remaining competitive with domain experts on their respective tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的智能体在长期交互中需要累积记忆来实现个性化和风格一致性，但现有系统对记忆使用采取"全有或全无"的二元方式，既容易让智能体被过去交互所困（记忆锚定），又会因完全不用记忆而丢失重要历史信息。

Method: 1. 引入了记忆依赖性的行为度量来量化过去交互对当前输出的影响；2. 提出了可调控记忆智能体（SteeM）框架，用户可动态调节记忆依赖度，从促进创新的重新开始模式到紧密遵循交互历史的高保真模式。

Result: 在不同场景的实验表明，该方法持续优于传统提示方法和固定的记忆掩蔽策略，为个性化人机协作提供了更精细有效的控制。

Conclusion: 将记忆依赖建模为显式且用户可控的维度是可行的，SteeM框架通过动态调节记忆依赖性，有效解决了记忆使用的平衡问题，提升了人机协作的效果。

Abstract: As LLM-based agents are increasingly used in long-term interactions, cumulative memory is critical for enabling personalization and maintaining stylistic consistency. However, most existing systems adopt an ``all-or-nothing'' approach to memory usage: incorporating all relevant past information can lead to \textit{Memory Anchoring}, where the agent is trapped by past interactions, while excluding memory entirely results in under-utilization and the loss of important interaction history. We show that an agent's reliance on memory can be modeled as an explicit and user-controllable dimension. We first introduce a behavioral metric of memory dependence to quantify the influence of past interactions on current outputs. We then propose \textbf{Stee}rable \textbf{M}emory Agent, \texttt{SteeM}, a framework that allows users to dynamically regulate memory reliance, ranging from a fresh-start mode that promotes innovation to a high-fidelity mode that closely follows interaction history. Experiments across different scenarios demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms conventional prompting and rigid memory masking strategies, yielding a more nuanced and effective control for personalized human-agent collaboration.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve remarkable performance by explicitly generating multi-step chains of thought, but this capability incurs substantial inference latency and computational cost. Collaborative inference offers a promising solution by selectively allocating work between lightweight and large models, yet a fundamental challenge remains: determining when a reasoning step requires the capacity of a large model or the efficiency of a small model. Existing routing strategies either rely on local token probabilities or post-hoc verification, introducing significant inference overhead. In this work, we propose a novel perspective on step-wise collaboration: the difficulty of a reasoning step can be inferred from its very first token. Inspired by the "Aha Moment" phenomenon in LRMs, we show that the entropy of the initial token serves as a strong predictor of step difficulty. Building on this insight, we introduce GlimpRouter, a training-free step-wise collaboration framework. GlimpRouter employs a lightweight model to generate only the first token of each reasoning step and routes the step to a larger model only when the initial token entropy exceeds a threshold. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces inference latency while preserving accuracy. For instance, GlimpRouter attains a substantial 10.7% improvement in accuracy while reducing inference latency by 25.9% compared to a standalone large model on AIME25. These results suggest a simple yet effective mechanism for reasoning: allocating computation based on a glimpse of thought rather than full-step evaluation.

TL;DR: LLM评委系统存在可靠性悖论：单个评委自身评分稳定，但评委间几乎无一致性；评委间的系统性分歧模式稳定如指纹，可通过评分区分具体评委，表明各评委代表不同的隐性质量理论框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检验LLM-as-judge评价系统的实际可靠性，探究表面可扩展性背后是否存在真实的评委间一致性，以及评分分歧的实质性质。

Method: 设计大规模实验（3240次评估：9评委×120唯一视频×数据包条目×3独立运行），测量评委间信度（Krippendorff's α）；训练分类器从评分模式识别评委；从多维度（严苛度、维度侧重、稳定性、证据行为等）刻画评委的'评估倾向'。

Result: 评委间一致性接近零（α=0.042），部分维度分歧超过随机噪声（α<0）；分类器仅凭评分即可77.1%准确识别具体评委，加入倾向特征达89.9%；同模型家族内区分度极高（GPT-4.1与GPT-5.2准确率99.6%）；评委展现稳定、可区分的评估倾向。

Conclusion: LLM评委并非测量同一构念的可互换工具，而是各具隐性质量理论的独立测量设备；平均评分产生的是脱离任何评委真实价值判断的合成裁决，这对基于LLM的自动化评估应用构成根本性质疑。

Abstract: LLM-as-judge systems promise scalable, consistent evaluation. We find the opposite: judges are consistent, but not with each other; they are consistent with themselves. Across 3,240 evaluations (9 judges x 120 unique video x pack items x 3 independent runs), inter-judge agreement is near-zero (Krippendorff's α = 0.042). On two dimensions, judges disagree more than random noise would predict (α < 0). Yet this disagreement isn't chaos; it's structured. A classifier identifies which judge produced an evaluation with 77.1% accuracy from rubric scores alone, rising to 89.9% with disposition features. Within model families, the signal is even stronger: GPT-4.1 and GPT-5.2 are distinguishable with 99.6% accuracy. We call this the reliability paradox: judges cannot agree on what constitutes quality, yet their disagreement patterns are so stable they function as fingerprints. Each judge implements a distinct, stable theory of quality: an "evaluative disposition" that shapes how it interprets any rubric. We characterize these dispositions along multiple axes: harshness/leniency, dimension emphasis, within-judge stability (ICC), and evidence behavior (receipt validity, semantic linkage via NLI, and shotgun index). The implication is stark: LLM judges are not interchangeable instruments measuring a shared construct. They are distinct measurement devices, each encoding its own implicit theory of quality. Averaging their scores produces a synthetic verdict that corresponds to no judge's actual values.

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) excelling in complex tasks present unique challenges for digital watermarking, as existing methods often disrupt logical coherence or incur high computational costs. Token-based watermarking techniques can corrupt the reasoning flow by applying pseudo-random biases, while semantic-aware approaches improve quality but introduce significant latency or require auxiliary models. This paper introduces ReasonMark, a novel watermarking framework specifically designed for reasoning-intensive LLMs. Our approach decouples generation into an undisturbed Thinking Phase and a watermarked Answering Phase. We propose a Criticality Score to identify semantically pivotal tokens from the reasoning trace, which are distilled into a Principal Semantic Vector (PSV). The PSV then guides a semantically-adaptive mechanism that modulates watermark strength based on token-PSV alignment, ensuring robustness without compromising logical integrity. Extensive experiments show ReasonMark surpasses state-of-the-art methods by reducing text Perplexity by 0.35, increasing translation BLEU score by 0.164, and raising mathematical accuracy by 0.67 points. These advancements are achieved alongside a 0.34% higher watermark detection AUC and stronger robustness to attacks, all with a negligible increase in latency. This work enables the traceable and trustworthy deployment of reasoning LLMs in real-world applications.

Motivation: 大语言模型的快速发展导致使用合成数据训练未来模型的兴趣增长，但这也创建了自消耗的再训练循环，模型基于自身输出训练可能导致性能下降并诱发新兴偏见。在实际应用中，先前部署的LLM会影响其生成的数据，形成由用户反馈驱动的动态系统。例如，如果模型持续服务不足某个群体，从该用户群体收集的查询数据就会减少。本研究旨在理解合成数据在这些动态迭代训练过程中如何影响偏见形成。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to growing interest in using synthetic data to train future models. However, this creates a self-consuming retraining loop, where models are trained on their own outputs and may cause performance drops and induce emerging biases. In real-world applications, previously deployed LLMs may influence the data they generate, leading to a dynamic system driven by user feedback. For example, if a model continues to underserve users from a group, less query data will be collected from this particular demographic of users. In this study, we introduce the concept of \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{C}onsuming \textbf{P}erformative \textbf{L}oop (\textbf{SCPL}) and investigate the role of synthetic data in shaping bias during these dynamic iterative training processes under controlled performative feedback. This controlled setting is motivated by the inaccessibility of real-world user preference data from dynamic production systems, and enables us to isolate and analyze feedback-driven bias evolution in a principled manner. We focus on two types of loops, including the typical retraining setting and the incremental fine-tuning setting, which is largely underexplored. Through experiments on three real-world tasks, we find that the performative loop increases preference bias and decreases disparate bias.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized text-based code automation, but their potential in graph-oriented engineering workflows remains under-explored. We introduce SimuAgent, an LLM-powered modeling and simulation agent tailored for Simulink. SimuAgent replaces verbose XML with a concise, dictionary-style Python representation, dramatically cutting token counts, improving interpretability, and enabling fast, in-process simulation. A lightweight plan-execute architecture, trained in two stages, equips the agent with both low-level tool skills and high-level design reasoning. To tackle sparse rewards in long-horizon tasks, we propose Reflection-GRPO (ReGRPO), which augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with self-reflection traces that supply rich intermediate feedback, accelerating convergence and boosting robustness. Experiments on SimuBench, our newly released benchmark comprising 5300 multi-domain modeling tasks, show that a Qwen2.5-7B model fine-tuned with SimuAgent converges faster and achieves higher modeling accuracy than standard RL baselines, and even surpasses GPT-4o when evaluated with few-shot prompting on the same benchmark. Ablations confirm that the two-stage curriculum and abstract-reconstruct data augmentation further enhance generalization. SimuAgent trains and runs entirely on-premise with modest hardware, delivering a privacy-preserving, cost-effective solution for industrial model-driven engineering. SimuAgent bridges the gap between LLMs and graphical modeling environments, offering a practical solution for AI-assisted engineering design in industrial settings.

Abstract: We present \textsc{MineNPC-Task}, a user-authored benchmark and evaluation harness for testing memory-aware, mixed-initiative LLM agents in open-world \emph{Minecraft}. Rather than relying on synthetic prompts, tasks are elicited from formative and summative co-play with expert players, normalized into parametric templates with explicit preconditions and dependency structure, and paired with machine-checkable validators under a bounded-knowledge policy that forbids out-of-world shortcuts. The harness captures plan/act/memory events-including plan previews, targeted clarifications, memory reads and writes, precondition checks, and repair attempts and reports outcomes relative to the total number of attempted subtasks, derived from in-world evidence.
  As an initial snapshot, we instantiate the framework with GPT-4o and evaluate \textbf{216} subtasks across \textbf{8} experienced players. We observe recurring breakdown patterns in code execution, inventory/tool handling, referencing, and navigation, alongside recoveries supported by mixed-initiative clarifications and lightweight memory. Participants rated interaction quality and interface usability positively, while highlighting the need for stronger memory persistence across tasks. We release the complete task suite, validators, logs, and harness to support transparent, reproducible evaluation of future memory-aware embodied agents.

Abstract: Agents capable of reasoning and planning in the real world require the ability of predicting the consequences of their actions. While world models possess this capability, they most often require action labels, that can be complex to obtain at scale. This motivates the learning of latent action models, that can learn an action space from videos alone. Our work addresses the problem of learning latent actions world models on in-the-wild videos, expanding the scope of existing works that focus on simple robotics simulations, video games, or manipulation data. While this allows us to capture richer actions, it also introduces challenges stemming from the video diversity, such as environmental noise, or the lack of a common embodiment across videos. To address some of the challenges, we discuss properties that actions should follow as well as relevant architectural choices and evaluations. We find that continuous, but constrained, latent actions are able to capture the complexity of actions from in-the-wild videos, something that the common vector quantization does not. We for example find that changes in the environment coming from agents, such as humans entering the room, can be transferred across videos. This highlights the capability of learning actions that are specific to in-the-wild videos. In the absence of a common embodiment across videos, we are mainly able to learn latent actions that become localized in space, relative to the camera. Nonetheless, we are able to train a controller that maps known actions to latent ones, allowing us to use latent actions as a universal interface and solve planning tasks with our world model with similar performance as action-conditioned baselines. Our analyses and experiments provide a step towards scaling latent action models to the real world.

Abstract: Parallel programming is central to HPC and AI, but producing code that is correct and fast remains challenging, especially for OpenMP GPU offload, where data movement and tuning dominate. Autonomous coding agents can compile, test, and profile on target hardware, but outputs are brittle without domain scaffolding.
  We present ParaCodex, an HPC-engineer workflow that turns a Codex-based agent into an autonomous OpenMP GPU offload system using staged hotspot analysis, explicit data planning, correctness gating, and profiling-guided refinement. We evaluate translation from serial CPU kernels to OpenMP GPU offload kernels on HeCBench, Rodinia, and NAS. After excluding five kernels, ParaCodex succeeded on all 31 valid kernels. The generated kernels improved GPU time over reference OpenMP implementations in 25/31 cases, achieving geometric-mean speedups of 3x on HeCBench and 5x on Rodinia, and outperforming a zero-shot Codex baseline on all suites. We also evaluate CUDA to OpenMP offload translation on ParEval, where ParaCodex maintains high compilation and validation rates in code-only and end-to-end settings.

Abstract: Scientific research increasingly depends on robust and scalable IT infrastructures to support complex computational workflows. With the proliferation of services provided by research infrastructures, NRENs, and commercial cloud providers, researchers must navigate a fragmented ecosystem of computing environments, balancing performance, cost, scalability, and accessibility. Hybrid cloud architectures offer a compelling solution by integrating multiple computing environments to enhance flexibility, resource efficiency, and access to specialised hardware.
  This paper provides a comprehensive overview of hybrid cloud deployment models, focusing on grid and cloud platforms (OpenPBS, SLURM, OpenStack, Kubernetes) and workflow management tools (Nextflow, Snakemake, CWL). We explore strategies for federated computing, multi-cloud orchestration, and workload scheduling, addressing key challenges such as interoperability, data security, reproducibility, and network performance. Drawing on implementations from life sciences, as coordinated by the ELIXIR Compute Platform and their integration into a wider EOSC context, we propose a roadmap for accelerating hybrid cloud adoption in research computing, emphasising governance frameworks and technical solutions that can drive sustainable and scalable infrastructure development.

Abstract: We present a new blocking linearizable stack implementation which utilizes sharding and fetch&increment to achieve significantly better performance than all existing concurrent stacks. The proposed implementation is based on a novel elimination mechanism and a new combining approach that are efficiently blended to gain high performance. Our implementation results in enhanced parallelism and low contention when accessing the shared stack. Experiments show that the proposed stack implementation outperforms all existing concurrent stacks by up to 2X in most workloads. It is particularly efficient in systems supporting a large number of threads and in high contention scenarios.

Motivation: 云计算环境中资源自动扩展机制依赖性能指标来做出最优配置决策，但当基础设施故障导致指标失真时，自动扩展器可能系统性地过度或不足配置资源，从而增加运营成本或降低服务可靠性。

Method: 通过受控模拟实验，测量四种常见故障类型如何影响水平和垂直自动扩展行为，涵盖多种实例配置和服务水平目标(SLO)阈值，对比不同扩展策略对故障引发指标失真的敏感性。

Result: 存储相关故障产生最大成本开销，在水平扩展策略下每月增加高达258美元；路由异常始终导致扩展器偏向资源分配不足；水平扩展对瞬态异常更敏感，尤其是在阈值边界附近。

Conclusion: 实验结果为设计故障容忍的自动扩展策略提供实证依据，这些策略应能区分真实工作负载波动与故障伪影，通过针对性容错机制优化云资源配置的成本效益和可靠性。

Abstract: Resource autoscaling mechanisms in cloud environments depend on accurate performance metrics to make optimal provisioning decisions. When infrastructure faults including hardware malfunctions, network disruptions, and software anomalies corrupt these metrics, autoscalers may systematically over- or under-provision resources, resulting in elevated operational expenses or degraded service reliability. This paper conducts controlled simulation experiments to measure how four prevalent fault categories affect both vertical and horizontal autoscaling behaviors across multiple instance configurations and service level objective (SLO) thresholds. Experimental findings demonstrate that storage-related faults generate the largest cost overhead, adding up to $258 monthly under horizontal scaling policies, whereas routing anomalies consistently bias autoscalers toward insufficient resource allocation. The sensitivity to fault-induced metric distortions differs markedly between scaling strategies: horizontal autoscaling exhibits greater susceptibility to transient anomalies, particularly near threshold boundaries. These empirically-grounded insights offer actionable recommendations for designing fault-tolerant autoscaling policies that distinguish genuine workload fluctuations from failure artifacts.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了Proof of Commitment(PoCmt)，一种基于不可并行化资源(实时人工参与)的新型共识原语，通过人类参与的时间稀缺性来实现线性Sybil成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于可并行化资源的共识协议(如PoW、PoS)，其Sybil成本趋于零边际成本，无法实现真正的线性Sybil防御。需要一种基于不可并行化资源的新范式来解决这一问题。

Method: 引入PoCmt共识原语，基于累积的人类努力、协议参与和在线可用性构建承诺状态，通过Human Challenge Oracle强制执行，该机制发布与身份绑定、时间敏感的挑战。

Result: 理论分析表明PoCmt实现严格的线性Sybil成本剖面，基于加权主干分析证明了在部分同步条件下的安全性、活动性和承诺比例公平性。模拟验证了预测的承诺漂移和公平性属性。

Conclusion: PoCmt为共识设计空间提供了新方向，将无许可安全性建立在持续的人工努力而非计算或资本上。

Abstract: Permissionless consensus protocols require a scarce resource to regulate leader election and provide Sybil resistance. Existing paradigms such as Proof of Work and Proof of Stake instantiate this scarcity through parallelizable resources like computation or capital. Once acquired, these resources can be subdivided across many identities at negligible marginal cost, making linear Sybil cost fundamentally unattainable.
  We introduce Proof of Commitment (PoCmt), a consensus primitive grounded in a non-parallelizable resource: real-time human engagement. Validators maintain a commitment state capturing cumulative human effort, protocol participation, and online availability. Engagement is enforced through a Human Challenge Oracle that issues identity-bound, time-sensitive challenges, limiting the number of challenges solvable within each human window.
  Under this model, sustaining multiple active identities requires proportional human-time effort. We establish a cost-theoretic separation showing that protocols based on parallelizable resources admit zero marginal Sybil cost, whereas PoCmt enforces a strictly linear cost profile. Using a weighted-backbone analysis, we show that PoCmt achieves safety, liveness, and commitment-proportional fairness under partial synchrony.
  Simulations complement the analysis by isolating human-time capacity as the sole adversarial bottleneck and validating the predicted commitment drift and fairness properties. These results position PoCmt as a new point in the consensus design space, grounding permissionless security in sustained human effort rather than computation or capital.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习方案主要考虑诚实但好奇的聚合器，但无法应对恶意聚合器操纵模型泄露客户端数据或停止计算的威胁。异步通信带来的非均匀客户端参与会降低隐私保护和引入训练偏差。

Method: 1. 复制聚合器容忍部分被恶意控制；2. 设计异步拜占庭聚合器下的隐私保护协议，客户端使用掩码和高斯噪声保护模型；3. 引入包含机制确保均匀客户端参与和平衡隐私预算；4. 无需聚合器间达成共识，规避异步环境共识不可能性。

Result: 方案在隐私保护、模型准确性和训练活性方面达到与现有最优方案相当的性能，同时增强了在恶意聚合器和异步环境下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Privacy-preserving federated averaging is a central approach for protecting client privacy in federated learning. In this paper, we study this problem in an asynchronous communications setting with malicious aggregators. We propose a new solution to provide federated averaging in this model while protecting the client's data privacy through secure aggregation and differential privacy. Our solution maintains the same performance as the state of the art across all metrics. The main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, unlike existing single- or multi-server solutions, we consider malicious aggregation servers that may manipulate the model to leak clients' data or halt computation. To tolerate this threat, we replicate the aggregators, allowing a fraction of them to be corrupted. Second, we propose a new privacy preservation protocol for protocols in asynchronous communication models with Byzantine aggregators. In this protocol, clients mask their values and add Gaussian noise to their models. In contrast with previous works, we use the replicated servers to unmask the models, while ensuring the liveness of training even if aggregators misbehave. Third, the asynchronous communication model introduces new challenges not present in existing approaches. In such a setting, faster clients may contribute more frequently, potentially reducing their privacy and biasing the training. To address this, we introduce an inclusion mechanism that ensures uniform client participation and balanced privacy budgets. Interestingly, the solution presented in this paper does not rely on agreement between aggregators. Thus, we circumvent the known impossibility of consensus in asynchronous settings where processes might crash. Additionally, this feature increases availability, as a consensus-based algorithm only progresses in periods of low latency.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Nalar是一个专门针对LLM驱动智能体应用设计的服务框架，通过解耦工作流规范与执行，提供运行时可见性和控制，实现异构智能体应用的高效、可扩展和策略驱动的服务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM驱动的智能体应用在自动化复杂多步骤任务时面临服务效率挑战，主要由于异构组件、动态模型驱动的控制流、长运行状态和不可预测延迟等因素，需要专门的框架来支持高效、稳健的服务。

Method: Nalar采用轻量级自动生成的存根，将智能体和工具调用转换为携带依赖和上下文元数据的futures；通过托管状态层解耦逻辑状态与物理放置；采用两级控制架构，结合全局策略计算与本地事件驱动执行，支持自适应路由、调度和资源管理。

Result: 在三个智能体负载测试中，Nalar将尾延迟降低了34-74%，实现了最高2.9倍的加速，在基线系统失败时维持80 RPS，并扩展到13万个futures且控制开销低于500毫秒。

Conclusion: Nalar能够在不增加开发者编排逻辑负担的情况下，为异构智能体应用提供可扩展、高效且策略驱动的服务，显著提升智能体应用的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: LLM-driven agentic applications increasingly automate complex, multi-step tasks, but serving them efficiently remains challenging due to heterogeneous components, dynamic and model-driven control flow, long-running state, and unpredictable latencies. Nalar is a ground-up agent-serving framework that cleanly separates workflow specification from execution while providing the runtime visibility and control needed for robust performance. Nalar preserves full Python expressiveness, using lightweight auto-generated stubs that turn agent and tool invocations into futures carrying dependency and context metadata. A managed state layer decouples logical state from physical placement, enabling safe reuse, migration, and consistent retry behavior. A two-level control architecture combines global policy computation with local event-driven enforcement to support adaptive routing, scheduling, and resource management across evolving workflows. Together, these mechanisms allow Nalar to deliver scalable, efficient, and policy-driven serving of heterogeneous agentic applications without burdening developers with orchestration logic. Across three agentic workloads, Nalar cuts tail latency by 34--74\%, achieves up to $2.9\times$ speedups, sustains 80 RPS where baselines fail, and scales to 130K futures with sub-500 ms control overhead.

Method: 基于三种工作负载洞察（统计可分解性、属性值组合的稀疏性、聚合操作效率结构），构建AHA系统以实现成本效益和保真度

Result: AHA能提供100%准确性的下游任务支持，相比传统方法降低高达85%的总拥有成本（计算+存储）

Conclusion: AHA系统通过合理利用高维时间序列数据特性，成功解决了替代历史分析中的成本与准确性权衡问题，在真实数据集和生产环境中验证了其有效性

Abstract: Many operational systems collect high-dimensional timeseries data about users/systems on key performance metrics. For instance, ISPs, content distribution networks, and video delivery services collect quality of experience metrics for user sessions associated with metadata (e.g., location, device, ISP). Over such historical data, operators and data analysts often need to run retrospective analysis; e.g., analyze anomaly detection algorithms, experiment with different configurations for alerts, evaluate new algorithms, and so on. We refer to this class of workloads as alternative history analysis for operational datasets. We show that in such settings, traditional data processing solutions (e.g., data warehouses, sampling, sketching, big-data systems) either pose high operational costs or do not guarantee accurate replay. We design and implement a system, called AHA (Alternative History Analytics), that overcomes both challenges to provide cost efficiency and fidelity for high-dimensional data. The design of AHA is based on analytical and empirical insights about such workloads: 1) the decomposability of underlying statistics; 2) sparsity in terms of active number of subpopulations over attribute-value combinations; and 3) efficiency structure of aggregation operations in modern analytics databases. Using multiple real-world datasets and as well as case-studies on production pipelines at a large video analytics company, we show that AHA provides 100% accuracy for a broad range of downstream tasks and up to 85x lower total cost of ownership (i.e., compute + storage) compared to conventional methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于结构对称性的索引方法，用于高效评估自由连接无环合取查询（fc-ACQs）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于值或顺序的索引方法在处理数据库结构对称性方面存在局限性，需要一种利用数据库内部结构对称性来加速查询处理的新方法。

Method: 通过构建辅助数据库$D_{col}$作为索引结构，该结构基于Scheidt和Schweikardt的“关系颜色细化”方法，能捕获数据库元组间的结构对称性。对fc-ACQs实现了恒定延迟枚举和计数。

Result: 索引预处理时间与$D_{col}$大小成线性关系，$D_{col}$大小由关系颜色细化分配的颜色数决定。对于二叉树林大小为对数级，对正则图为常数级，最坏情况为线性级。

Conclusion: 这是首个基于数据库内部结构对称性的索引基础性成果，在某些数据库族上能实现优于数据库大小的性能表现，为fc-ACQs评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present an index structure to boost the evaluation of free-connex acyclic conjunctive queries (fc-ACQs) over relational databases. The main ingredient of the index associated with a given database $D$ is an auxiliary database $D_{col}$. Our main result states that for any fc-ACQ $Q$ over $D$, we can count the number of answers of $Q$ or enumerate them with constant delay after a preprocessing phase that takes time linear in the size of $D_{col}$.
  Unlike previous indexing methods based on values or order (e.g., B+ trees), our index is based on structural symmetries among tuples in a database, and the size of $D_{col}$ is related to the number of colors assigned to $D$ by Scheidt and Schweikardt's "relational color refinement" (2025). In the particular case of graphs, this coincides with the minimal size of an equitable partition of the graph. For example, the size of $D_{col}$ is logarithmic in the case of binary trees and constant for regular graphs. Even in the worst-case that $D$ has no structural symmetries among tuples at all, the size of $D_{col}$ is still linear in the size of $D$.
  Given that the size of $D_{col}$ is bounded by the size of $D$ and can be much smaller (even constant for some families of databases), our index is the first foundational result on indexing internal structural symmetries of a database to evaluate all fc-ACQs with performance potentially strictly smaller than the database size.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Time series decomposition into trend, seasonal structure, and residual components is a core primitive for downstream analytics such as anomaly detection, change-point detection, and forecasting. However, most existing seasonal-trend decomposition methods rely on user-specified or estimated season lengths and implicitly assume stable periodic structure. These assumptions limit robustness and deployability in large, heterogeneous collections where recurring patterns may drift, appear intermittently, or exist at multiple time scales.
  We propose LGTD (Local-Global Trend Decomposition), a season-length-free decomposition framework that represents a time series as the sum of a smooth global trend, adaptive local trends whose recurrence induces implicit (emergent) seasonal structure, and a residual component. Rather than explicitly modeling seasonality through a fixed or estimated period, LGTD treats seasonal structure as an emergent property arising from repeated local trend regimes. Concretely, LGTD first estimates a global trend capturing long-term evolution, then applies AutoTrend, an adaptive error-driven local linear trend inference module, to segment the detrended signal into short-lived piecewise-linear regimes. Residuals are obtained after removing both global and local trends.
  By eliminating manual season-length specification, LGTD supports automated, low-touch deployment across time series with irregular, drifting, or weakly periodic structure. We analyze computational complexity and show that LGTD scales linearly with series length under mild conditions. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate robust and balanced decomposition performance across fixed, transitive, and variable season-length settings, especially where period-based methods degrade.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Static filtering is a data-independent optimisation method for Datalog, which generalises algebraic query rewriting techniques from relational databases. In spite of its early discovery by Kifer and Lozinskii in 1986, the method has been overlooked in recent research and system development, and special cases are being rediscovered independently. We therefore recall the original approach, using updated terminology and more general filter predicates that capture features of modern systems, and we show how to extend its applicability to answer set programming (ASP). The outcome is strictly more general but also more complex than the classical approach: double exponential in general and single exponential even for predicates of bounded arity. As a solution, we propose tractable approximations of the algorithm that can still yield much improved logic programs in typical cases, e.g., it can improve the performance of rule systems over real-world data in the order of magnitude.

Motivation: 现有基于单一提示智能体的方法直接通过Blender MCP等工具执行建模命令，在几何精度、美学质量和任务完成率方面存在局限，需要一种结合智能体自我反思和人类监督的结构化方法来提升3D建模质量。

Method: 提出Planner-Actor-Critic架构：Planner协调建模步骤，Actor执行命令，Critic提供迭代反馈，人类用户作为监督者和顾问参与全过程。通过系统比较单一提示建模与反思型多智能体方法，评估几何精度、美学质量和任务完成率的提升。

Conclusion: 结构化的智能体自我反思在增强人类监督和顾问指导后，能够生成更高质量的3D模型，同时通过实时Blender同步保持高效的工作流集成，为创意3D建模提供了有效的多智能体协作框架。

Abstract: We present a framework that extends the Actor-Critic architecture to creative 3D modeling through multi-agent self-reflection and human-in-the-loop supervision. While existing approaches rely on single-prompt agents that directly execute modeling commands via tools like Blender MCP, our approach introduces a Planner-Actor-Critic architecture. In this design, the Planner coordinates modeling steps, the Actor executes them, and the Critic provides iterative feedback, while human users act as supervisors and advisors throughout the process. Through systematic comparison between single-prompt modeling and our reflective multi-agent approach, we demonstrate improvements in geometric accuracy, aesthetic quality, and task completion rates across diverse 3D modeling scenarios. Our evaluation reveals that critic-guided reflection, combined with human supervisory input, reduces modeling errors and increases complexity and quality of the result compared to direct single-prompt execution. This work establishes that structured agent self-reflection, when augmented by human oversight and advisory guidance, produces higher-quality 3D models while maintaining efficient workflow integration through real-time Blender synchronization.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了FinDeepForecast——首个实时评估深度研究智能体在金融预测任务中性能的多智能体系统，创建了包含大量公司和宏观经济体的周度基准，实验表明AI智能体虽优于基线但仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于大语言模型的深度研究智能体在处理复杂研究任务方面取得了进展，但其在高风险领域（如金融）的真实世界研究型预测任务中的实时评估仍未被充分探索，需要系统化的评估框架。

Method: 提出FinDeepForecast系统：一个实时端到端多智能体系统，采用双轨道分类法动态生成企业和宏观层面的周期性及非周期性预测任务，构建了包含8个经济体、1,314家上市公司的十周评估基准FinDeepForecastBench，评估了13种代表性方法。

Result: 实验表明，深度研究智能体能持续超越强基线方法，但在真正的向前瞻性金融推理方面仍存在不足，与理想的金融预测能力仍有差距。

Conclusion: FinDeepForecast系统将持续推动深度研究智能体在研究型金融预测任务中的未来发展，相关基准和排行榜已在OpenFinArena平台公开提供。

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) Agents powered by advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally shifted the paradigm for completing complex research tasks. Yet, a comprehensive and live evaluation of their forecasting performance on real-world, research-oriented tasks in high-stakes domains (e.g., finance) remains underexplored. We introduce FinDeepForecast, the first live, end-to-end multi-agent system for automatically evaluating DR agents by continuously generating research-oriented financial forecasting tasks. This system is equipped with a dual-track taxonomy, enabling the dynamic generation of recurrent and non-recurrent forecasting tasks at both corporate and macro levels. With this system, we generate FinDeepForecastBench, a weekly evaluation benchmark over a ten-week horizon, encompassing 8 global economies and 1,314 listed companies, and evaluate 13 representative methods. Extensive experiments show that, while DR agents consistently outperform strong baselines, their performance still falls short of genuine forward-looking financial reasoning. We expect the proposed FinDeepForecast system to consistently facilitate future advancements of DR agents in research-oriented financial forecasting tasks. The benchmark and leaderboard are publicly available on the OpenFinArena Platform.

TL;DR: Sphinx是一个统一的LLM-based PR review框架，通过结构化数据生成、基于checklist的评估基准和CRPO训练方法，解决噪声监督、上下文理解不足和评估指标不充分等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动化PR review面临三大挑战：噪声监督、上下文理解有限和评估指标不足。这些问题限制了自动化PR review的质量和实用性。

Method: 1）结构化数据生成管道：通过比较伪修改代码和合并代码生成语义丰富、情境准确的review comments。2）基于checklist的评估基准：通过结构化、可操作的验证点评估review质量。3）Checklist Reward Policy Optimization (CRPO)：使用基于规则、可解释的奖励来对齐模型行为与实际review实践。

Result: Sphinx训练模型在review完整性和精确度上达到最先进性能，在checklist覆盖方面比专有和开源baseline高出40%。

Conclusion: Sphinx能够开发出不仅流畅、且具备情境意识、技术精准、可实际部署于开发工作流的PR review模型。

Abstract: Pull request (PR) review is essential for ensuring software quality, yet automating this task remains challenging due to noisy supervision, limited contextual understanding, and inadequate evaluation metrics. We present Sphinx, a unified framework for LLM-based PR review that addresses these limitations through three key components: (1) a structured data generation pipeline that produces context-rich, semantically grounded review comments by comparing pseudo-modified and merged code; (2) a checklist-based evaluation benchmark that assesses review quality based on structured coverage of actionable verification points, moving beyond surface-level metrics like BLEU; and (3) Checklist Reward Policy Optimization (CRPO), a novel training paradigm that uses rule-based, interpretable rewards to align model behavior with real-world review practices. Extensive experiments show that models trained with Sphinx achieve state-of-the-art performance on review completeness and precision, outperforming both proprietary and open-source baselines by up to 40\% in checklist coverage. Together, Sphinx enables the development of PR review models that are not only fluent but also context-aware, technically precise, and practically deployable in real-world development workflows. The data will be released after review.

Abstract: Recent advances in language models (LMs) have driven significant progress in various software engineering tasks. However, existing LMs still struggle with complex programming scenarios due to limitations in data quality, model architecture, and reasoning capability. This research systematically addresses these challenges through three complementary directions: (1) improving code data quality with a code difference-guided adversarial augmentation technique (CODA) and a code denoising technique (CodeDenoise); (2) enhancing model architecture via syntax-guided code LMs (LEAM and LEAM++); and (3) advancing model reasoning with a prompting technique (muFiX) and an agent-based technique (Specine). These techniques aim to promote the practical adoption of LMs in software development and further advance intelligent software engineering.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have automated various software engineering tasks, with benchmarks emerging to evaluate their capabilities. However, for adaptation, a critical activity during code reuse, there is no benchmark to assess LLMs' performance, leaving their practical utility in this area unclear. To fill this gap, we propose AdaptEval, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on code snippet adaptation. Unlike existing benchmarks, AdaptEval incorporates the following three distinctive features: First, Practical Context. Tasks in AdaptEval are derived from developers' practices, preserving rich contextual information from Stack Overflow and GitHub communities. Second, Multi-granularity Annotation. Each task is annotated with requirements at both task and adaptation levels, supporting the evaluation of LLMs across diverse adaptation scenarios. Third, Fine-grained Evaluation. AdaptEval includes a two-tier testing framework combining adaptation-level and function-level tests, which enables evaluating LLMs' performance across various individual adaptations. Based on AdaptEval, we conduct the first empirical study to evaluate six instruction-tuned LLMs and especially three reasoning LLMs on code snippet adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaptEval enables the assessment of LLMs' adaptation capabilities from various perspectives. It also provides critical insights into their current limitations, particularly their struggle to follow explicit instructions. We hope AdaptEval can facilitate further investigation and enhancement of LLMs' capabilities in code snippet adaptation, supporting their real-world applications.

### [167] [4D-ARE: Bridging the Attribution Gap in LLM Agent Requirements Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04556)
*Bo Yu,Lei Zhao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出4D-ARE方法，用于系统化地规范基于归因驱动的LLM智能体的设计时需求，弥补了现有运行时推理框架（如ReAct）在定义智能体应推理什么内容方面的不足


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体在执行任务时能提供正确答案，但当被问及'为什么'这类因果解释问题时，却只返回指标而非真正的归因解释。这反映了运行时推理框架（如ReAct）虽然解决了'如何推理'的问题，但'应推理什么'的设计时规范仍未被充分探索

Method: 提出4D-ARE（四维度归因驱动的智能体需求工程）方法，核心洞见是：决策者需要的是归因而非单纯答案。该方法将归因组织成四个维度（结果→过程→支持→长期），基于Pearl因果层次理论。框架通过五层操作化，生成可直接编译为系统提示的工件

Result: 在金融服务领域进行了工业试点部署，初步验证了方法的可行性。该方法解决了智能体'应推理什么'的问题，与现有运行时框架（解决'如何推理'）形成互补

Conclusion: 4D-ARE为基于归因的LLM智能体提供了一种系统化的设计时规范方法，有望增强基础推理框架的实际应用效果。本文提出了方法论建议和初步工业验证，严格的实证评估计划在未来工作中进行

Abstract: We deployed an LLM agent with ReAct reasoning and full data access. It executed flawlessly, yet when asked "Why is completion rate 80%?", it returned metrics instead of causal explanation. The agent knew how to reason but we had not specified what to reason about. This reflects a gap: runtime reasoning frameworks (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought) have transformed LLM agents, but design-time specification--determining what domain knowledge agents need--remains under-explored. We propose 4D-ARE (4-Dimensional Attribution-Driven Agent Requirements Engineering), a preliminary methodology for specifying attribution-driven agents. The core insight: decision-makers seek attribution, not answers. Attribution concerns organize into four dimensions (Results -> Process -> Support -> Long-term), motivated by Pearl's causal hierarchy. The framework operationalizes through five layers producing artifacts that compile directly to system prompts. We demonstrate the methodology through an industrial pilot deployment in financial services. 4D-ARE addresses what agents should reason about, complementing runtime frameworks that address how. We hypothesize systematic specification amplifies the power of these foundational advances. This paper presents a methodological proposal with preliminary industrial validation; rigorous empirical evaluation is planned for future work.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper introduces DDMIN-LOC, a technique that combines Delta Debugging Minimization (DDMIN) with Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL). It can be applied to programs taking string inputs, even when only a single failure-inducing input is available. DDMIN is an algorithm that systematically explores the minimal failure-inducing input that exposes a bug, given an initial failing input. However, it does not provide information about the faulty statements responsible for the failure. DDMIN-LOC addresses this limitation by collecting the passing and failing inputs generated during the DDMIN process and computing suspiciousness scores for program statements and predicates using SBFL algorithms. These scores are then combined to rank statements according to their likelihood of being faulty. DDMIN-LOC requires only one failing input of the buggy program, although it can be applied only to programs that take string inputs. DDMIN-LOC was evaluated on 136 programs selected from the QuixBugs and Codeflaws benchmarks using the SBFL algorithms Tarantula, Ochiai, GenProg, Jaccard and DStar. Experimental results show that DDMIN-LOC performs best with Jaccard: in most subjects, fewer than 20% executable lines need to be examined to locate the faulty statements. Moreover, in most subjects, faulty statements are ranked within the top 3 positions in all the generated test suites derived from different failing inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跟踪Untappd应用2020年至2025年的演变，分析其游戏化特征和伦理框架的变化，评估酗酒游戏化设计的持续伦理风险

Method: 采用纵向分析方法，结合传统伦理理论和软件工程实践框架，对五类徽章系统及其对用户自主权和健康的影响进行深入研究

Result: 尽管进行了微调并添加了表面免责声明，但原有伦理问题仍然存在，设计仍会促使危险饮酒行为正常化

Conclusion: 软件设计需要在其生命周期中嵌入持续伦理反思机制，避免通过游戏化设计将危险行为正常化

Abstract: This paper presents a longitudinal ethical analysis of Untappd, a social drinking application that gamifies beer consumption through badges, streaks, and social sharing. Building on an exploratory study conducted in 2020, we revisit the platform in 2025 to examine how its gamification features and ethical framings have evolved. Drawing on traditional ethical theory and practical frameworks for Software Engineering, we analyze five categories of badges and their implications for user autonomy and well-being. Our findings show that, despite small adjustments and superficial disclaimers, many of the original ethical issues remain. We argue for continuous ethical reflection built embedded into software lifecycles to prevent the normalization of risky behaviors through design.

Abstract: Pull request (PR) descriptions generated by AI coding agents are the primary channel for communicating code changes to human reviewers. However, the alignment between these messages and the actual changes remains unexplored, raising concerns about the trustworthiness of AI agents. To fill this gap, we analyzed 23,247 agentic PRs across five agents using PR message-code inconsistency (PR-MCI). We contributed 974 manually annotated PRs, found 406 PRs (1.7%) exhibited high PR-MCI, and identified eight PR-MCI types, revealing that descriptions claiming unimplemented changes was the most common issue (45.4%). Statistical tests confirmed that high-MCI PRs had 51.7% lower acceptance rates (28.3% vs. 80.0%) and took 3.5x longer to merge (55.8 vs. 16.0 hours). Our findings suggest that unreliable PR descriptions undermine trust in AI agents, highlighting the need for PR-MCI verification mechanisms and improved PR generation to enable trustworthy human-AI collaboration.

### [171] [AVX / NEON Intrinsic Functions: When Should They Be Used?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04922)
*Théo Boivin,Joeffrey Legaux*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一个跨配置基准来评估AVX/NEON内在函数在通用开发项目中的能力和局限性，旨在指导开发者根据OS、架构和编译器选择是否使用内在函数进行向量化优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对开发者在需要向量化策略优化代码时，缺乏关于何时使用AVX/NEON内在函数的实用指导。不同操作系统、架构和编译器的差异使得这一决策复杂化，因此需要一个系统性的评估框架。

Method: 设计并实施跨配置基准测试，在不同操作系统、架构和编译器环境下，对比分析使用内在函数与编译器自动向量化的性能表现，特别关注条件分支等关键场景。

Result: 内在函数在条件分支处理上表现优异，执行时间可降至普通代码的5%左右；但在许多情况下，编译器已能很好地自动向量化代码，使用内在函数反而不必要。结果因具体配置而异，需具体情况具体分析。

Conclusion: 内在函数在特定场景（如条件分支）中能显著提升性能，但在许多常规情况下，依赖编译器自动向量化已足够。开发者应根据具体配置（OS、架构、编译器）和目标代码特征，审慎评估是否使用内在函数。

Abstract: A cross-configuration benchmark is proposed to explore the capacities and limitations of AVX / NEON intrinsic functions in a generic context of development project, when a vectorisation strategy is required to optimise the code. The main aim is to guide developers to choose when using intrinsic functions, depending on the OS, architecture and/or available compiler. Intrinsic functions were observed highly efficient in conditional branching, with intrinsic version execution time reaching around 5% of plain code execution time. However, intrinsic functions were observed as unnecessary in many cases, as the compilers already well auto-vectorise the code.
