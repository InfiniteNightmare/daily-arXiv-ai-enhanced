Abstract: Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) combines game-theoretic equilibrium computation with learning and is effective in approximating Nash Equilibrium in zero-sum games. However, the computational cost of PSRO has become a significant limitation to its practical application. Our analysis shows that game simulation is the primary bottleneck in PSRO's runtime. To address this issue, we conclude the concept of Simulation-Free PSRO and summarize existing methods that instantiate this concept. Additionally, we propose a novel Dynamic Window-based Simulation-Free PSRO, which introduces the concept of a strategy window to replace the original strategy set maintained in PSRO. The number of strategies in the strategy window is limited, thereby simplifying opponent strategy selection and improving the robustness of the best response. Moreover, we use Nash Clustering to select the strategy to be eliminated, ensuring that the number of strategies within the strategy window is effectively limited. Our experiments across various environments demonstrate that the Dynamic Window mechanism significantly reduces exploitability compared to existing methods, while also exhibiting excellent compatibility. Our code is available at https://github.com/enochliu98/SF-PSRO.

Abstract: Finding a free parking space in a city has become a challenging task over the past decades. A recently proposed auction-based parking assignment can alleviate cruising for parking and also set a market-driven, demand-responsive parking price. However, the wide acceptance of such a system is far from certain.
  To evaluate the merits of auction-based parking assignment, we assume that drivers have access to a smartphone-based reservation system prior to its mandatory introduction and thus have the opportunity to test and experience its merits voluntarily. We set our experiment as Eclipse SUMO simulations with different rates of participants and non-participants to check how different market penetration levels affect the traffic flow, the performance of the auction-based assignment system, and the financial outcomes. The results show that the auction-based system improves traffic flow with increasing penetration rates, allowing participants to park gradually closer to their preferred parking lots. However, it comes with a price; the system also increases parking expenditures for participants. Interestingly, non-participating drivers will face even higher parking prices. Consequently, they will be motivated to use the new system.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly instantiated as interacting agents in multi-agent systems (MAS), where collective decisions emerge through social interaction rather than independent reasoning. A fundamental yet underexplored mechanism in this process is conformity, the tendency of agents to align their judgments with prevailing group opinions. This paper presents a systematic study of how network topology shapes conformity dynamics in LLM-based MAS through a misinformation detection task. We introduce a confidence-normalized pooling rule that controls the trade-off between self-reliance and social influence, enabling comparisons between two canonical decision paradigms: Centralized Aggregation and Distributed Consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that network topology critically governs both the efficiency and robustness of collective judgments. Centralized structures enable immediate decisions but are sensitive to hub competence and exhibit same-model alignment biases. In contrast, distributed structures promote more robust consensus, while increased network connectivity speeds up convergence but also heightens the risk of wrong-but-sure cascades, in which agents converge on incorrect decisions with high confidence. These findings characterize the conformity dynamics in LLM-based MAS, clarifying how network topology and self-social weighting jointly shape the efficiency, robustness, and failure modes of collective decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NAIAD是一个基于大语言模型和行为AI的辅助系统，通过集成多种外部工具对内陆水体提供一站式遥感监控解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前内陆水监测方法通常孤立处理各项指标（如蓝藻、叶绿素等），缺乏综合性的解决方案。NAIAD旨在通过统一平台整合多源遥感数据和分析工具，为专家和非专家用户提供便捷、全面的水质监控服务。

Method: 系统采用检索增强生成（RAG）、LLM推理、外部工具编排、计算图执行和行为反思等技术，结合天气数据、Sentinel-2影像、遥感指数计算（如NDCI）、叶绿素a估算以及CyFi等平台，通过单一提示接口将自然语言查询转化为可执行的分析流程。

Result: 在专用基准测试中，系统正确率达到77%以上，相关性超过85%，涵盖多个用户专业水平。初步结果表明其具有良好的查询适应性和鲁棒性。消融研究显示Gemma 3 (27B)和Qwen 2.5 (14B)在计算效率和推理性能之间取得最佳平衡。

Conclusion: NAIAD证明了基于LLM的行为AI能够整合复杂遥感数据源，为内陆水监测提供端到端解决方案，在保持高正确性和相关性的同时，为不同专业背景的用户简化了水质监控过程。

Abstract: Inland water monitoring is vital for safeguarding public health and ecosystems, enabling timely interventions to mitigate risks. Existing methods often address isolated sub-problems such as cyanobacteria, chlorophyll, or other quality indicators separately. NAIAD introduces an agentic AI assistant that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and external analytical tools to deliver a holistic solution for inland water monitoring using Earth Observation (EO) data. Designed for both experts and non-experts, NAIAD provides a single-prompt interface that translates natural-language queries into actionable insights. Through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM reasoning, external tool orchestration, computational graph execution, and agentic reflection, it retrieves and synthesizes knowledge from curated sources to produce tailored reports. The system integrates diverse tools for weather data, Sentinel-2 imagery, remote-sensing index computation (e.g., NDCI), chlorophyll-a estimation, and established platforms such as CyFi. Performance is evaluated using correctness and relevancy metrics, achieving over 77% and 85% respectively on a dedicated benchmark covering multiple user-expertise levels. Preliminary results show strong adaptability and robustness across query types. An ablation study on LLM backbones further highlights Gemma 3 (27B) and Qwen 2.5 (14B) as offering the best balance between computational efficiency and reasoning performance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM) relies critically on understanding and extrapolating process-property relationships; however, existing data-driven approaches remain limited by fragmented knowledge representations and unreliable extrapolation under sparse data conditions. In this study, we propose an ontology-guided, equation-centric framework that tightly integrates large language models (LLMs) with an additive manufacturing mathematical knowledge graph (AM-MKG) to enable reliable knowledge extraction and principled extrapolative modeling. By explicitly encoding equations, variables, assumptions, and their semantic relationships within a formal ontology, unstructured literature is transformed into machine-interpretable representations that support structured querying and reasoning. LLM-based equation generation is further conditioned on MKG-derived subgraphs, enforcing physically meaningful functional forms and mitigating non-physical or unstable extrapolation trends. To assess reliability beyond conventional predictive uncertainty, a confidence-aware extrapolation assessment is introduced, integrating extrapolation distance, statistical stability, and knowledge-graph-based physical consistency into a unified confidence score. Results demonstrate that ontology-guided extraction significantly improves the structural coherence and quantitative reliability of extracted knowledge, while subgraph-conditioned equation generation yields stable and physically consistent extrapolations compared to unguided LLM outputs. Overall, this work establishes a unified pipeline for ontology-driven knowledge representation, equation-centered reasoning, and confidence-based extrapolation assessment, highlighting the potential of knowledge-graph-augmented LLMs as reliable tools for extrapolative modeling in additive manufacturing.

### [6] [Improving Enzyme Prediction with Chemical Reaction Equations by Hypergraph-Enhanced Knowledge Graph Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05330)
*Tengwei Song,Long Yin,Zhen Han,Zhiqiang Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Hyper-Enz模型，该模型将化学反应方程表示为知识图谱三元组，通过知识图谱嵌入和超图变压器捕获复杂关系，显著提升了酶-底物预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有酶-底物相互作用预测方法依赖稀疏且维护成本高的专家标注数据库，训练数据不足限制了传统模型的泛化能力。化学反应方程数据库更易获取、数据更密集丰富，但其中多个化合物与同一酶的交互模式复杂，传统模型难以捕捉。

Method: 将化学反应方程表示为知识图谱三元组（反应物、酶、产物），提出Hyper-Enz模型：整合超图变压器与KGE模型学习涉及多个反应物和产物的超边表示，并引入多专家范式，利用模型和化学反应方程共同指导酶-底物相互作用学习。

Result: 相比传统模型，平均酶检索准确率相对提升达88%，配对级预测精度提升30%，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过将化学反应方程表示为知识图谱、结合超图变换器和知识图谱嵌入，能够有效捕捉复杂生化关系，显著改善酶-底物相互作用预测性能。

Abstract: Predicting enzyme-substrate interactions has long been a fundamental problem in biochemistry and metabolic engineering. While existing methods could leverage databases of expert-curated enzyme-substrate pairs for models to learn from known pair interactions, the databases are often sparse, i.e., there are only limited and incomplete examples of such pairs, and also labor-intensive to maintain. This lack of sufficient training data significantly hinders the ability of traditional enzyme prediction models to generalize to unseen interactions. In this work, we try to exploit chemical reaction equations from domain-specific databases, given their easier accessibility and denser, more abundant data. However, interactions of multiple compounds, e.g., educts and products, with the same enzymes create complex relational data patterns that traditional models cannot easily capture. To tackle that, we represent chemical reaction equations as triples of (educt, enzyme, product) within a knowledge graph, such that we can take advantage of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to infer missing enzyme-substrate pairs for graph completion. Particularly, in order to capture intricate relationships among compounds, we propose our knowledge-enhanced hypergraph model for enzyme prediction, i.e., Hyper-Enz, which integrates a hypergraph transformer with a KGE model to learn representations of the hyper-edges that involve multiple educts and products. Also, a multi-expert paradigm is introduced to guide the learning of enzyme-substrate interactions with both the proposed model and chemical reaction equations. Experimental results show a significant improvement, with up to a 88% relative improvement in average enzyme retrieval accuracy and 30% improvement in pair-level prediction compared to traditional models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文系统评估了医学LLM中基于角色的控制，发现医疗角色在危重症任务中提升性能（准确率提升达~20%），但在初级护理场景中会降低性能，显示出非单调、上下文依赖的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 角色设定常被视为LLM的行为先验，被认为能单向提升专业性和安全性，但其对高风险临床决策的具体影响尚不清楚。研究旨在系统评估专业角色和交互风格在不同医疗任务中对LLM行为的影响。

Method: 通过对LLM施加医疗专业角色（急诊医生、护士等）和交互风格（大胆vs谨慎），在临床分诊和患者安全任务上进行多维度评估，涵盖任务准确性、校准度和安全相关风险行为。

Result: 医疗角色在危重症任务中显著提升性能（准确率+~20%），但在初级护理中降低类似幅度；交互风格调节风险倾向但高度模型依赖；LLM评分支持医疗角色在安全关键案例中的优势，但临床医生对其推理质量信心较低（95.9%低置信度）。

Conclusion: 角色作为行为先验引入的是上下文依赖的权衡，而非安全或专业性的保证，强调了在临床环境中使用角色设定时需要情境化评估。

Abstract: Persona conditioning can be viewed as a behavioral prior for large language models (LLMs) and is often assumed to confer expertise and improve safety in a monotonic manner. However, its effects on high-stakes clinical decision-making remain poorly characterized. We systematically evaluate persona-based control in clinical LLMs, examining how professional roles (e.g., Emergency Department physician, nurse) and interaction styles (bold vs.\ cautious) influence behavior across models and medical tasks. We assess performance on clinical triage and patient-safety tasks using multidimensional evaluations that capture task accuracy, calibration, and safety-relevant risk behavior. We find systematic, context-dependent, and non-monotonic effects: Medical personas improve performance in critical care tasks, yielding gains of up to $\sim+20\%$ in accuracy and calibration, but degrade performance in primary-care settings by comparable margins. Interaction style modulates risk propensity and sensitivity, but it's highly model-dependent. While aggregated LLM-judge rankings favor medical over non-medical personas in safety-critical cases, we found that human clinicians show moderate agreement on safety compliance (average Cohen's $κ= 0.43$) but indicate a low confidence in 95.9\% of their responses on reasoning quality. Our work shows that personas function as behavioral priors that introduce context-dependent trade-offs rather than guarantees of safety or expertise.

Abstract: As AI agents increasingly operate in multi-agent environments, understanding their collective behavior becomes critical for predicting the dynamics of artificial societies. This study examines conformity, the tendency to align with group opinions under social pressure, in large multimodal language models functioning as AI agents. By adapting classic visual experiments from social psychology, we investigate how AI agents respond to group influence as social actors. Our experiments reveal that AI agents exhibit a systematic conformity bias, aligned with Social Impact Theory, showing sensitivity to group size, unanimity, task difficulty, and source characteristics. Critically, AI agents achieving near-perfect performance in isolation become highly susceptible to manipulation through social influence. This vulnerability persists across model scales: while larger models show reduced conformity on simple tasks due to improved capabilities, they remain vulnerable when operating at their competence boundary. These findings reveal fundamental security vulnerabilities in AI agent decision-making that could enable malicious manipulation, misinformation campaigns, and bias propagation in multi-agent systems, highlighting the urgent need for safeguards in collective AI deployments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Standard safety alignment optimizes Large Language Models (LLMs) for universal helpfulness and honesty, effectively instilling a rigid "Boy Scout" morality. While robust for general-purpose assistants, this one-size-fits-all ethical framework imposes a "transparency tax" on professional domains requiring strategic ambiguity and information withholding, such as public relations, negotiation, and crisis management. To measure this gap between general safety and professional utility, we introduce Crisis-Bench, a multi-agent Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that evaluates LLMs in high-stakes corporate crises. Spanning 80 diverse storylines across 8 industries, Crisis-Bench tasks an LLM-based Public Relations (PR) Agent with navigating a dynamic 7-day corporate crisis simulation while managing strictly separated Private and Public narrative states to enforce rigorous information asymmetry. Unlike traditional benchmarks that rely on static ground truths, we introduce the Adjudicator-Market Loop: a novel evaluation metric where public sentiment is adjudicated and translated into a simulated stock price, creating a realistic economic incentive structure. Our results expose a critical dichotomy: while some models capitulate to ethical concerns, others demonstrate the capacity for Machiavellian, legitimate strategic withholding in order to stabilize the simulated stock price. Crisis-Bench provides the first quantitative framework for assessing "Reputation Management" capabilities, arguing for a shift from rigid moral absolutism to context-aware professional alignment.

Abstract: Cheating in chess, by using advice from powerful software, has become a major problem, reaching the highest levels. As opposed to the large majority of previous work, which concerned {\em detection} of cheating, here we try to evaluate the possible gain in performance, obtained by cheating a limited number of times during a game. Algorithms are developed and tested on a commonly used chess engine (i.e software).\footnote{Needless to say, the goal of this work is not to assist cheaters, but to measure the effectiveness of cheating -- which is crucial as part of the effort to contain and detect it.}

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在复杂决策中缺乏透明度，无法提供可靠的解释并有效纠正错误，限制了其在高风险环境中的应用。

Method: 构建声明验证的自适应推理树：根据根声明生成支持或反对的子论点，自底向上通过大语言模型评委对子论点进行两两竞赛判定，最终得出透明的可争议验证结果。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证表明，ART的结构化推理方法优于现有基线，为可解释声明验证设立了新标准。

Conclusion: ART通过树状结构与竞技判定机制实现了透明且可争议的声明验证，解决了大语言模型在高风险决策中信任度不足的问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful candidates for complex decision-making, leveraging vast encoded knowledge and remarkable zero-shot abilities. However, their adoption in high-stakes environments is hindered by their opacity; their outputs lack faithful explanations and cannot be effectively contested to correct errors, undermining trustworthiness. In this paper, we propose ART (Adaptive Reasoning Trees), a hierarchical method for claim verification. The process begins with a root claim, which branches into supporting and attacking child arguments. An argument's strength is determined bottom-up via a pairwise tournament of its children, adjudicated by a judge LLM, allowing a final, transparent and contestable verdict to be systematically derived which is missing in methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). We empirically validate ART on multiple datasets, analyzing different argument generators and comparison strategies. Our findings show that ART's structured reasoning outperforms strong baselines, establishing a new benchmark for explainable claim verification which is more reliable and ensures clarity in the overall decision making step.

TL;DR: 提出了MMUEChange多模态智能体框架，通过灵活整合异构城市数据解决遥感变化检测的刚性单模态分析局限，显著提升了任务成功率并减少了幻觉生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前城市环境变化分析方法特别是遥感变化检测，通常依赖刚性的单模态分析，难以处理复杂的城市变化场景。为了克服这些限制，需要一个能够灵活整合多种异构数据、支持跨模态对齐的分析框架。

Method: 提出了MMUEChange多模态智能体框架，包含模块化工具包和核心模块——模态控制器，用于实现跨模态和模态内对齐，从而实现对复杂城市变化场景的稳健分析。

Result: 相比性能最佳的基线，MMUEChange智能体将任务成功率提升了46.7%，并有效缓解了幻觉问题。案例研究展示了该框架在纽约小型社区公园增加、香港跨区域水污染扩散、深圳垃圾填埋场减少等实际场景中的应用。

Conclusion: MMUEChange框架能够支持具有现实政策意义的复杂城市变化分析任务，为可持续城市发展提供了有效的技术工具。

Abstract: Understanding urban environment change is essential for sustainable development. However, current approaches, particularly remote sensing change detection, often rely on rigid, single-modal analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose MMUEChange, a multi-modal agent framework that flexibly integrates heterogeneous urban data via a modular toolkit and a core module, Modality Controller for cross- and intra-modal alignment, enabling robust analysis of complex urban change scenarios. Case studies include: a shift toward small, community-focused parks in New York, reflecting local green space efforts; the spread of concentrated water pollution across districts in Hong Kong, pointing to coordinated water management; and a notable decline in open dumpsites in Shenzhen, with contrasting links between nighttime economic activity and waste types, indicating differing urban pressures behind domestic and construction waste. Compared to the best-performing baseline, the MMUEChange agent achieves a 46.7% improvement in task success rate and effectively mitigates hallucination, demonstrating its capacity to support complex urban change analysis tasks with real-world policy implications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种考虑专家标注不确定性的概率评估范式，强调忽略地面真值不确定性会高估非专家系统的性能，并建议按专家一致性进行分层评估以提高对比可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI系统评估方法忽略地面真值标注的不确定性，这在医学等高不确定性领域尤为严重，可能导致将非专家错误判断为有专家级性能。

Method: 建立概率范式从理论上解释高确定性对专家表现的重要性，提出预期准确率和预期F1得分来衡量给定地面真值变异下的性能，推荐按专家同意率分层评估的策略。

Result: 研究表明：地面真值高确定性是专家获得高分的必要条件；专家一致性低的场景下专家与随机标注者差异很小；分层评估在高确定性组别中能减少不确定性的混淆效应。

Conclusion: 建议评估AI系统时按专家同意率进行数据分层，特别是在总体性能低于80%时分层评估对可靠比较至关重要，这能更真实反映系统在确定性场景下的能力。

Abstract: Benchmarking the relative capabilities of AI systems, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Models, typically ignores the impact of uncertainty in the underlying ground truth answers from experts. This ambiguity is particularly consequential in medicine where uncertainty is pervasive. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic paradigm to theoretically explain how high certainty in ground truth answers is almost always necessary for even an expert to achieve high scores, whereas in datasets with high variation in ground truth answers there may be little difference between a random labeller and an expert. Therefore, ignoring uncertainty in ground truth evaluation data can result in the misleading conclusion that a non-expert has similar performance to that of an expert. Using the probabilistic paradigm, we thus bring forth the concepts of expected accuracy and expected F1 to estimate the score an expert human or system can achieve given ground truth answer variability.
  Our work leads to the recommendation that when establishing the capability of a system, results should be stratified by probability of the ground truth answer, typically measured by the agreement rate of ground truth experts. Stratification becomes critical when the overall performance drops below a threshold of 80%. Under stratified evaluation, performance comparison becomes more reliable in high certainty bins, mitigating the effect of the key confounding factor -- uncertainty.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence now outperforms humans in several scientific and engineering tasks, yet its internal representations often remain opaque. In this Perspective, we argue that explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), combined with causal reasoning, enables {\it learning from the learners}. Focusing on discovery, optimization and certification, we show how the combination of foundation models and explainability methods allows the extraction of causal mechanisms, guides robust design and control, and supports trust and accountability in high-stakes applications. We discuss challenges in faithfulness, generalization and usability of explanations, and propose XAI as a unifying framework for human-AI collaboration in science and engineering.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了大语言模型在安全关键场景中的表现，发现即使99%的准确率也意味着无法承受的风险，当前模型不适合直接部署在机器人等安全关键系统中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地应用于机器人决策，其物理风险显著增加——单个错误指令可能直接危及生命安全。现有评估方法未能充分衡量LLM在错误即意味着灾难的安全关键场景中的性能，迫切需要系统性评估框架来揭示潜在的安全隐患。

Method: 通过火灾疏散场景的定性评估识别关键失败案例，设计了7个定量评估任务：完整信息任务（使用ASCII地图最小化解释歧义）、不完整信息任务（测试模型推理缺失上下文能力）、安全导向空间推理任务。对多种LLM和VLM进行基准测试，特别分析1%失败率在实际应用中的灾难性后果。

Result: 结果揭示了严重的安全漏洞：多款模型在ASCII导航中成功率为0%；模拟火灾演习中，模型指示机器人朝危险区域而非紧急出口移动；当前最先进模型也无法保证安全，99%准确率在机器人应用中意味着每百次执行就有一次可能导致灾难性后果。

Conclusion: 当前的大语言模型尚未准备好直接部署到安全关键系统中。即使在基准测试中表现优异，极低概率的错误在实际物理环境中也会导致不可接受的风险。不能绝对依赖这些模型的决定，需要更严格的安全保障机制。

Abstract: One mistake by an AI system in a safety-critical setting can cost lives. As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to robotics decision-making, the physical dimension of risk grows; a single wrong instruction can directly endanger human safety. This paper addresses the urgent need to systematically evaluate LLM performance in scenarios where even minor errors are catastrophic. Through a qualitative evaluation of a fire evacuation scenario, we identified critical failure cases in LLM-based decision-making. Based on these, we designed seven tasks for quantitative assessment, categorized into: Complete Information, Incomplete Information, and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR). Complete information tasks utilize ASCII maps to minimize interpretation ambiguity and isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing. Incomplete information tasks require models to infer missing context, testing for spatial continuity versus hallucinations. SOSR tasks use natural language to evaluate safe decision-making in life-threatening contexts. We benchmark various LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks. Beyond aggregate performance, we analyze the implications of a 1% failure rate, highlighting how "rare" errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes. Results reveal serious vulnerabilities: several models achieved a 0% success rate in ASCII navigation, while in a simulated fire drill, models instructed robots to move toward hazardous areas instead of emergency exits. Our findings lead to a sobering conclusion: current LLMs are not ready for direct deployment in safety-critical systems. A 99% accuracy rate is dangerously misleading in robotics, as it implies one out of every hundred executions could result in catastrophic harm. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models cannot guarantee safety, and absolute reliance on them creates unacceptable risks.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language model (LLM) reasoning has focused on domains like mathematics and coding, where abundant high-quality data and objective evaluation metrics are readily available. In contrast, progress in LLM reasoning models remains limited in scientific domains such as medicine and materials science due to limited dataset coverage and the inherent complexity of open-ended scientific questions. To address these challenges, we introduce WildSci, a new dataset of domain-specific science questions automatically synthesized from peer-reviewed literature, covering 9 scientific disciplines and 26 subdomains. By framing complex scientific reasoning tasks in a multiple-choice format, we enable scalable training with well-defined reward signals. We further apply reinforcement learning to finetune models on these data and analyze the resulting training dynamics, including domain-specific performance changes, response behaviors, and generalization trends. Experiments on a suite of scientific benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and approach. We release WildSci to enable scalable and sustainable research in scientific reasoning, available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/JustinTX/WildSci.

Abstract: E-commerce platforms and payment solution providers face increasingly sophisticated fraud schemes, ranging from identity theft and account takeovers to complex money laundering operations that exploit the speed and anonymity of digital transactions. However, despite their theoretical promise, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to fraud detection in real-world financial contexts remains largely unexploited, and their practical effectiveness in handling domain-specific e-commerce transaction data has yet to be empirically validated. To bridge this gap between conventional machine learning limitations and the untapped potential of LLMs in fraud detection, this paper proposes a novel approach that employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to post-train lightweight language models specifically for fraud detection tasks using only raw transaction data. We utilize the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm combined with a rule-based reward system to fine-tune language models of various sizes on a real-life transaction dataset provided by a Chinese global payment solution company. Through this reinforcement learning framework, the language models are encouraged to explore diverse trust and risk signals embedded within the textual transaction data, including patterns in customer information, shipping details, product descriptions, and order history. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with post-trained language models achieving substantial F1-score improvements on held-out test data. Our findings demonstrate that the observed performance improvements are primarily attributable to the exploration mechanism inherent in reinforcement learning, which allows models to discover novel fraud indicators beyond those captured by traditional engineered features.

Abstract: In web search and recommendation systems, user clicks are widely used to train ranking models. However, click data is heavily biased, i.e., users tend to click higher-ranked items (position bias), choose only what was shown to them (selection bias), and trust top results more (trust bias). Without explicitly modeling these biases, the true relevance of ranked items cannot be correctly learned from clicks. Existing Unbiased Learning-to-Rank (ULTR) methods mainly correct position bias and rely on propensity estimation, but they cannot measure remaining bias, provide risk guarantees, or jointly handle multiple bias sources. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel causal learning-based ranking framework that extends ULTR by combining Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with information-theoretic tools. SCMs specify how clicks are generated and help identify the true relevance signal from click data, while conditional mutual information, measures how much bias leaks into the
  learned relevance estimates. We use this leakage measure to define a rigorous notion of disentanglement and include it as a regularizer during model training to reduce bias. In addition, we incorporate a causal inference estimator, i.e., doubly robust estimator, to ensure more reliable risk estimation. Experiments on standard Learning-to-Rank benchmarks show that our method consistently reduces measured bias leakage and improves ranking performance, especially in realistic scenarios where multiple biases-such as position and trust bias-interact strongly.

Abstract: Conventional Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods aim to infer missing information in incomplete Knowledge Graphs (KGs) by leveraging existing information, which struggle to perform effectively in scenarios involving emerging entities. Inductive KGC methods can handle the emerging entities and relations in KGs, offering greater dynamic adaptability. While existing inductive KGC methods have achieved some success, they also face challenges, such as susceptibility to noisy structural information during reasoning and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies in reasoning paths. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Cumulative Path-Level Semantic Reasoning for inductive knowledge graph completion (CPSR) framework, which simultaneously captures both the structural and semantic information of KGs to enhance the inductive KGC task. Specifically, the proposed CPSR employs a query-dependent masking module to adaptively mask noisy structural information while retaining important information closely related to the targets. Additionally, CPSR introduces a global semantic scoring module that evaluates both the individual contributions and the collective impact of nodes along the reasoning path within KGs. The experimental results demonstrate that CPSR achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个理论框架来评估生成模型的可控性，设计了估计对话模型中可控集的算法，并提供了分布式概率近似正确边界的形式化保证。实证验证在对话和文生图任务中显示模型可控性存在脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型的普及，需要对生成过程进行细粒度控制。尽管控制生成方法（从提示到微调）不断涌现，但一个基本问题仍未解决：这些模型是否真正可控？本研究旨在为这一问题提供理论框架和形式化答案。

Method: 将人和模型的交互建模为控制过程，提出了一种新颖算法来估计对话设置中模型的可控集。该方法提供估计误差随样本复杂度变化的形式化保证，推导出概率近似正确边界，这些边界是分布式无关的，仅假设输出有界，适用于任何黑盒非线性控制系统（即任何生成模型）。

Result: 在不同对话过程控制任务（包括语言模型和文本到图像生成）上的实证结果显示，模型可控性出人意料地脆弱，且高度依赖于实验设置。这表明模型的实际可控性有限，挑战了通用可控性的假设。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要对可控性进行严格分析，将重点从简单地尝试控制转向首先理解其基本限制。结果揭示了模型可控性的脆弱性和环境依赖性，为未来可控生成方法的设计提供了重要见解。

Abstract: As generative models become ubiquitous, there is a critical need for fine-grained control over the generation process. Yet, while controlled generation methods from prompting to fine-tuning proliferate, a fundamental question remains unanswered: are these models truly controllable in the first place? In this work, we provide a theoretical framework to formally answer this question. Framing human-model interaction as a control process, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the controllable sets of models in a dialogue setting. Notably, we provide formal guarantees on the estimation error as a function of sample complexity: we derive probably-approximately correct bounds for controllable set estimates that are distribution-free, employ no assumptions except for output boundedness, and work for any black-box nonlinear control system (i.e., any generative model). We empirically demonstrate the theoretical framework on different tasks in controlling dialogue processes, for both language models and text-to-image generation. Our results show that model controllability is surprisingly fragile and highly dependent on the experimental setting. This highlights the need for rigorous controllability analysis, shifting the focus from simply attempting control to first understanding its fundamental limits.

Abstract: High-fidelity agent initialization is crucial for credible Agent-Based Modeling across diverse domains. A robust framework should be Topic-Adaptive, capturing macro-level joint distributions while ensuring micro-level individual rationality. Existing approaches fall into two categories: static data-based retrieval methods that fail to adapt to unseen topics absent from the data, and LLM-based generation methods that lack macro-level distribution awareness, resulting in inconsistencies between micro-level persona attributes and reality. To address these problems, we propose HAG, a Hierarchical Agent Generation framework that formalizes population generation as a two-stage decision process. Firstly, utilizing a World Knowledge Model to infer hierarchical conditional probabilities to construct the Topic-Adaptive Tree, achieving macro-level distribution alignment. Then, grounded real-world data, instantiation and agentic augmentation are carried out to ensure micro-level consistency. Given the lack of specialized evaluation, we establish a multi-domain benchmark and a comprehensive PACE evaluation framework. Extensive experiments show that HAG significantly outperforms representative baselines, reducing population alignment errors by an average of 37.7% and enhancing sociological consistency by 18.8%.

Conclusion: 协作混合扩散策略框架有效解决了混合动作空间的表达能力和可扩展性问题，通过离散-连续策略协作和降维映射显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Hybrid action space, which combines discrete choices and continuous parameters, is prevalent in domains such as robot control and game AI. However, efficiently modeling and optimizing hybrid discrete-continuous action space remains a fundamental challenge, mainly due to limited policy expressiveness and poor scalability in high-dimensional settings. To address this challenge, we view the hybrid action space problem as a fully cooperative game and propose a \textbf{Cooperative Hybrid Diffusion Policies (CHDP)} framework to solve it. CHDP employs two cooperative agents that leverage a discrete and a continuous diffusion policy, respectively. The continuous policy is conditioned on the discrete action's representation, explicitly modeling the dependency between them. This cooperative design allows the diffusion policies to leverage their expressiveness to capture complex distributions in their respective action spaces. To mitigate the update conflicts arising from simultaneous policy updates in this cooperative setting, we employ a sequential update scheme that fosters co-adaptation. Moreover, to improve scalability when learning in high-dimensional discrete action space, we construct a codebook that embeds the action space into a low-dimensional latent space. This mapping enables the discrete policy to learn in a compact, structured space. Finally, we design a Q-function-based guidance mechanism to align the codebook's embeddings with the discrete policy's representation during training. On challenging hybrid action benchmarks, CHDP outperforms the state-of-the-art method by up to $19.3\%$ in success rate.

Abstract: Despite the success of test-time scaling, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) frequently encounter repetitive loops that lead to computational waste and inference failure. In this paper, we identify a distinct failure mode termed Circular Reasoning. Unlike traditional model degeneration, this phenomenon manifests as a self-reinforcing trap where generated content acts as a logical premise for its own recurrence, compelling the reiteration of preceding text. To systematically analyze this phenomenon, we introduce LoopBench, a dataset designed to capture two distinct loop typologies: numerical loops and statement loops. Mechanistically, we characterize circular reasoning as a state collapse exhibiting distinct boundaries, where semantic repetition precedes textual repetition. We reveal that reasoning impasses trigger the loop onset, which subsequently persists as an inescapable cycle driven by a self-reinforcing V-shaped attention mechanism. Guided by these findings, we employ the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm to capture these precursors for early loop prediction. Experiments across diverse LRMs validate its accuracy and elucidate the stability of long-chain reasoning.

Motivation: 现有神经符号NLI方法依赖固定的逻辑形式主义，限制了鲁棒性和适应性。为了解决这一限制，论文提出将底层逻辑作为可控组件而非静态背景来处理，从而实现更灵活、可适应的推理系统。

Method: 采用LogiKEy方法论，将一系列经典和非经典逻辑形式体系嵌入高阶逻辑(HOL)中，创建逻辑参数化框架。对比了逻辑外部方法(通过公理编码规范要求)与逻辑内部方法(规范模式从逻辑内置结构中涌现)。在规范推理领域进行了广泛的实验比较。

Result: 实验表明：1)逻辑内部策略能持续提升NLI性能并产生更高效的混合证明；2)逻辑有效性具有领域依赖性：一阶逻辑在常识推理中表现更优，道义和模态逻辑在伦理领域表现更佳；3)逻辑参数化方法提供了系统比较推理质量、解释细化和证明行为的框架。

Conclusion: 将逻辑作为神经符号架构中的一等参数化元素具有重要价值，能够实现更鲁棒、模块化和可适应的推理系统。逻辑选择应根据推理领域进行定制化，而非使用固定的形式体系。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and theorem provers (TPs) can be effectively combined for verifiable natural language inference (NLI). However, existing approaches rely on a fixed logical formalism, a feature that limits robustness and adaptability. We propose a logic-parametric framework for neuro-symbolic NLI that treats the underlying logic not as a static background, but as a controllable component. Using the LogiKEy methodology, we embed a range of classical and non-classical formalisms into higher-order logic (HOL), enabling a systematic comparison of inference quality, explanation refinement, and proof behavior. We focus on normative reasoning, where the choice of logic has significant implications. In particular, we compare logic-external approaches, where normative requirements are encoded via axioms, with logic-internal approaches, where normative patterns emerge from the logic's built-in structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that logic-internal strategies can consistently improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs for NLI. In addition, we show that the effectiveness of a logic is domain-dependent, with first-order logic favouring commonsense reasoning, while deontic and modal logics excel in ethical domains. Our results highlight the value of making logic a first-class, parametric element in neuro-symbolic architectures for more robust, modular, and adaptable reasoning.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly integrated into privacy-critical domains, yet existing evaluations of personally identifiable information (PII) leakage largely treat privacy as a static extraction task and ignore how a subject's online presence--the volume of their data available online--influences privacy alignment. We introduce PII-VisBench, a novel benchmark containing 4000 unique probes designed to evaluate VLM safety through the continuum of online presence. The benchmark stratifies 200 subjects into four visibility categories: high, medium, low, and zero--based on the extent and nature of their information available online. We evaluate 18 open-source VLMs (0.3B-32B) based on two key metrics: percentage of PII probing queries refused (Refusal Rate) and the fraction of non-refusal responses flagged for containing PII (Conditional PII Disclosure Rate). Across models, we observe a consistent pattern: refusals increase and PII disclosures decrease (9.10% high to 5.34% low) as subject visibility drops. We identify that models are more likely to disclose PII for high-visibility subjects, alongside substantial model-family heterogeneity and PII-type disparities. Finally, paraphrasing and jailbreak-style prompts expose attack and model-dependent failures, motivating visibility-aware safety evaluation and training interventions.

TL;DR: 针对现有多智能体辩论框架中因初始化方式导致智能体推理路径重复、辩论效果受限的问题，提出了Dynamic Multi-Agent Debate (DynaDebate)，通过动态路径生成与分配、过程中心辩论及触发式验证智能体三个机制有效提升辩论质量与最终性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的多智能体系统在协作决策和复杂问题解决方面取得了显著进展，但现有的多智能体辩论框架往往采用无引导的初始化方式，导致各智能体倾向于采用相同的推理路径，犯下相同错误。这不仅阻碍了有效的辩论过程，还使得最终结果往往退化为简单的多数投票，未能充分发挥多智能体辩论的潜力。

Method: 提出DynaDebate框架，包含三个核心机制：1) 动态路径生成与分配：使用专门的路径生成智能体创建多样化且逻辑合理的解决方案路径，并自适应地分配冗余；2) 过程中心辩论：将关注点从表面结果投票转向严格的逐步骤逻辑批判，确保推理过程的正确性；3) 触发式验证智能体：当出现分歧时激活，利用外部工具客观地解决僵局。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，DynaDebate在多个基准测试中都取得了优越的性能表现，超过了现有最先进的多智能体辩论方法。

Conclusion: DynaDebate通过动态路径生成、过程中心辩论和触发式验证机制的有机结合，有效解决了传统多智能体辩论框架中路径同质化和辩论低效的问题，显著提升了多智能体协作推理的质量和准确性。该方法为构建更高效、更可靠的多智能体辩论系统提供了新的思路和技术途径。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), which excel at collaborative decision-making and complex problem-solving. Recently, researchers have further investigated Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) frameworks, which enhance the reasoning and collaboration capabilities of MAS through information exchange and debate among multiple agents. However, existing approaches often rely on unguided initialization, causing agents to adopt identical reasoning paths that lead to the same errors. As a result, effective debate among agents is hindered, and the final outcome frequently degenerates into simple majority voting. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we introduce Dynamic Multi-Agent Debate (DynaDebate), which enhances the effectiveness of multi-agent debate through three key mechanisms: (1) Dynamic Path Generation and Allocation, which employs a dedicated Path Generation Agent to generate diverse and logical solution paths with adaptive redundancy; (2) Process-Centric Debate, which shifts the focus from surface-level outcome voting to rigorous step-by-step logic critique to ensure process correctness; (3) A Trigger-Based Verification Agent, which is activated upon disagreement and uses external tools to objectively resolve deadlocks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaDebate achieves superior performance across various benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art MAD methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly deployed as computer-use agents (CUAs) that operate desktops and browsers. Top-performing CUAs are framework-based systems that decompose planning and execution, while end-to-end screenshot-to-action policies are easier to deploy but lag behind on benchmarks such as OSWorld-Verified. GUI datasets like OSWorld pose two bottlenecks: they expose only a few hundred interactive, verifiable tasks and environments, and expert trajectories must be gathered by interacting with these environments, making such data hard to scale. We therefore ask how reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) can best exploit a small pool of exist expert trajectories to train end-to-end policies. Naively mixing these off-policy traces into on-policy RLVR is brittle: even after format conversion, expert trajectories exhibit structural mismatch and distribution shift from the learner. We propose BEPA (Bi-Level Expert-to-Policy Assimilation), which turns static expert traces into policy-aligned guidance via self-rolled reachable trajectories under the base policy (LEVEL-1) and a per-task, dynamically updated cache used in RLVR (LEVEL-2). On OSWorld-Verified, BEPA improves UITARS1.5-7B success from 22.87% to 32.13% and raises a held-out split from 5.74% to 10.30%, with consistent gains on MMBench-GUI and Online-Mind2Web.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems based on large language models, particularly centralized architectures, have recently shown strong potential for complex and knowledge-intensive tasks. However, central agents often suffer from unstable long-horizon collaboration due to the lack of memory management, leading to context bloat, error accumulation, and poor cross-task generalization. To address both task-level memory inefficiency and the inability to reuse coordination experience, we propose StackPlanner, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with explicit memory control. StackPlanner addresses these challenges by decoupling high-level coordination from subtask execution with active task-level memory control, and by learning to retrieve and exploit reusable coordination experience via structured experience memory and reinforcement learning. Experiments on multiple deep-search and agent system benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling reliable long-horizon multi-agent collaboration.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as a promising paradigm for agents, with long-term planning and decision-making emerging as core general-purpose capabilities for adapting to diverse scenarios and tasks. Real-time strategy (RTS) games serve as an ideal testbed for evaluating these two capabilities, as their inherent gameplay requires both macro-level strategic planning and micro-level tactical adaptation and action execution. Existing RTS game-based environments either suffer from relatively high computational demands or lack support for textual observations, which has constrained the use of RTS games for LLM evaluation. Motivated by this, we present TowerMind, a novel environment grounded in the tower defense (TD) subgenre of RTS games. TowerMind preserves the key evaluation strengths of RTS games for assessing LLMs, while featuring low computational demands and a multimodal observation space, including pixel-based, textual, and structured game-state representations. In addition, TowerMind supports the evaluation of model hallucination and provides a high degree of customizability. We design five benchmark levels to evaluate several widely used LLMs under different multimodal input settings. The results reveal a clear performance gap between LLMs and human experts across both capability and hallucination dimensions. The experiments further highlight key limitations in LLM behavior, such as inadequate planning validation, a lack of multifinality in decision-making, and inefficient action use. We also evaluate two classic reinforcement learning algorithms: Ape-X DQN and PPO. By offering a lightweight and multimodal design, TowerMind complements the existing RTS game-based environment landscape and introduces a new benchmark for the AI agent field. The source code is publicly available on GitHub(https://github.com/tb6147877/TowerMind).

Abstract: In safety-critical domains, linguistic ambiguity can have severe consequences; a vague command like "Pass me the vial" in a surgical setting could lead to catastrophic errors. Yet, most embodied AI research overlooks this, assuming instructions are clear and focusing on execution rather than confirmation. To address this critical safety gap, we are the first to define Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection, a fundamental new task where a model must determine if a command has a single, unambiguous meaning within a given 3D scene. To support this research, we build Ambi3D, the large-scale benchmark for this task, featuring over 700 diverse 3D scenes and around 22k instructions. Our analysis reveals a surprising limitation: state-of-the-art 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to reliably determine if an instruction is ambiguous. To address this challenge, we propose AmbiVer, a two-stage framework that collects explicit visual evidence from multiple views and uses it to guide an vision-language model (VLM) in judging instruction ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the challenge of our task and the effectiveness of AmbiVer, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy embodied AI.

*Debangshu Banerjee,Olivier Bouissou,Stefan Zetzsche*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DafnyPro 是一个推断时间框架，通过三个组件提升LLM在Dafny语言中生成验证注释的性能，并在多个基准测试中取得显著效果提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高LLM在形式化验证（特别是Dafny语言）中生成正确验证注释的能力，降低人工编写验证逻辑的工作量

Method: 1) diff-checker防止基础程序逻辑被修改；2) pruner移除不必要的循环不变式；3) hint-augmentation检索和应用预定义的问题无关证明策略

Result: 在Claude Sonnet 3.5/3.7上，DafnyPro在四个基准测试（Clover、MBPP-Dafny、HumanEval-Dafny、DafnyBench）均带来性能提升。在最具挑战性的DafnyBench上，Claude Sonnet 3.5结合DafnyPro达到86%正确证明率（提升16个百分点）。基于DafnyPro生成的数据微调的7B和14B Qwen模型分别达到68%和70%的正确证明率

Conclusion: DafnyPro有效提升LLM的Dafny验证注释生成质量，较小的模型通过相关训练数据也能维持较高的验证准确率

Abstract: We present DafnyPro, an inference-time framework that enhances LLMs for generating verification annotations in Dafny. DafnyPro comprises three key components: a diff-checker that prevents modifications to base program logic, a pruner that removes unnecessary invariants, and a hint-augmentation system that retrieves and applies predefined, problem-independent proof strategies. We evaluate DafnyPro using Claude Sonnet 3.5 and 3.7 on four benchmarks: Clover, MBPP-Dafny, HumanEval-Dafny, and DafnyBench, achieving consistent performance gains in all cases. Notably, on DafnyBench, the most challenging benchmark, Claude Sonnet 3.5 enhanced with DafnyPro achieves 86% correct proofs, a 16 pp improvement over the base model. We also fine-tune two Qwen models on training data derived from verification attempts by larger models enhanced with DafnyPro. Our 7B and 14B models achieve 68% and 70% correct proofs on DafnyBench, respectively, demonstrating that smaller models can maintain high verification accuracy.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of small Uncrewed Aerial Systems (sUAS) in diverse and often safety-critical environments demands rigorous validation of onboard decision logic under various conditions. In this paper, we present SaFUZZ, a state-aware fuzzing pipeline that validates core behavior associated with state transitions, automated failsafes, and human operator interactions in sUAS applications operating under various timing conditions and environmental disturbances. We create fuzzing specifications to detect behavioral deviations, and then dynamically generate associated Fault Trees to visualize states, modes, and environmental factors that contribute to the failure, thereby helping project stakeholders to analyze the failure and identify its root causes. We validated SaFUZZ against a real-world sUAS system and were able to identify several points of failure not previously detected by the system's development team. The fuzzing was conducted in a high-fidelity simulation environment, and outcomes were validated on physical sUAS in a real-world field testing setting. The findings from the study demonstrated SaFUZZ's ability to provide a practical and scalable approach to uncovering diverse state transition failures in a real-world sUAS application.

*Chao Wei,Xinyi Peng,Yawen Yan,Mao Luo,Ting Cai*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 将基路径生成重构为声明式优化问题，使用混合整数规划(MIP)框架生成结构简单的全局最优基路径集，包含整体MIP模型和增量MIP两种策略，后者在大规模控制流图上实现100%成功率和高效计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基路径测试的自动化方法依赖贪心图遍历算法(如DFS/BFS)产生次优路径，这种结构上的缺陷会阻碍下游测试活动，包括使自动化测试数据生成复杂化并增加人类工程师的认知负担。

Method: 提出混合整数规划(MIP)框架：1)整体MIP模型保证理论最优路径集；2)可扩展的增量MIP策略用于大型复杂拓扑，采用多目标函数优先考虑路径简洁性并引入新颖性惩罚以最大化线性独立路径的成功生成。

Result: 在真实代码和大规模合成控制流图上的实证评估表明，增量MIP策略在生成完整基集方面达到100%成功率，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 该工作为生成高质量的结构'支架'提供了基础方法，能够提升后续测试生成工作的效率和有效性。

Abstract: Basis path testing is a cornerstone of structural testing, yet traditional automated methods, relying on greedy graph-traversal algorithms (e.g., DFS/BFS), often generate sub-optimal paths. This structural inferiority is not a trivial issue; it directly impedes downstream testing activities by complicating automated test data generation and increasing the cognitive load for human engineers. This paper reframes basis path generation from a procedural search task into a declarative optimization problem. We introduce a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) framework designed to produce a complete basis path set that is globally optimal in its structural simplicity. Our framework includes two complementary strategies: a Holistic MIP model that guarantees a theoretically optimal path set, and a scalable Incremental MIP strategy for large, complex topologies. The incremental approach features a multi-objective function that prioritizes path simplicity and incorporates a novelty penalty to maximize the successful generation of linearly independent paths. Empirical evaluations on both real-code and large-scale synthetic Control Flow Graphs demonstrate that our Incremental MIP strategy achieves a 100\% success rate in generating complete basis sets, while remaining computationally efficient. Our work provides a foundational method for generating a high-quality structural "scaffold" that can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of subsequent test generation efforts.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出STELP（LLM生成程序的安全转义器和执行器），用于在受控环境中安全执行LLM生成的代码，解决直接在生产系统中使用LLM生成代码的安全性和可靠性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在代码生成方面取得重大进展，但直接在生产系统中使用LLM生成的代码存在安全隐患（数据中毒、恶意攻击、幻觉等）。传统安全测试工具和人工代码审查在大规模AI系统中不切实际或不值得信赖，因此需要一种安全执行LLM生成代码的解决方案。

Method: 开发STELP系统，它是一个安全的转义器和执行器，能够在受控和安全的环境中执行LLM生成的代码。方法包括：1) 创建人工验证的不安全代码片段数据集；2) 在公开数据集上对正确性、安全性和延迟进行基准测试；3) 通过控制执行环境防止恶意代码影响生产系统。

Result: 实验表明，STELP在安全执行风险代码片段方面显著优于现有方法。基准测试显示其在正确性、安全性和延迟方面的优越性能。该系统能够安全处理包含恶意内容的不安全代码片段。

Conclusion: STELP填补了传统安全测试方法和人工监督在AI系统代码生成应用中的空白，为无头代码生成执行和实时执行LLM生成的代码片段等应用提供了可行的安全解决方案，使LLM生成的代码能够在生产AI系统中安全使用。

Abstract: Rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved major advances in reasoning, planning, and function-calling capabilities. Multi-agentic collaborative frameworks using such LLMs place them at the center of solving software development-related tasks such as code generation. However, direct use of LLM generated code in production software development systems is problematic. The code could be unstable or erroneous and contain vulnerabilities such as data poisoning, malicious attacks, and hallucinations that could lead to widespread system malfunctions. This prohibits the adoption of LLM generated code in production AI systems where human code reviews and traditional secure testing tools are impractical or untrustworthy. In this paper, we discuss safety and reliability problems with the execution of LLM generated code and propose a Secure Transpiler and Executor of LLM-Generated Program (STELP), capable of executing LLM-generated code in a controlled and safe manner. STELP secures autonomous production AI systems involving code generation, filling the critical void left by the impracticality or limitations of traditional secure testing methodologies and human oversight. This includes applications such as headless code generation-execution and LLMs that produce executable code snippets as an action plan to be executed in real time. We contribute a human-validated dataset of insecure code snippets and benchmark our approach on publicly available datasets for correctness, safety, and latency. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms an existing method by a significant margin, particularly in its ability to safely execute risky code snippets. Warning: This paper contains malicious code snippets that should be run with caution.

*Wenhao Zeng,Yitian Chai,Hao Zhou,Fandong Meng,Jie Zhou,Xiaodong Gu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RoFTCodeSum的微调方法，专为解决代码摘要任务中模型对低可读性代码缺乏鲁棒性的问题，该方法结合课程学习与元学习理念，通过渐进式难度的训练集提升模型在语义干扰下的稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码语言模型和基准测试主要面向高可读性代码（含充足语义线索，如函数名、变量名），然而现实世界中的代码往往结构混乱或经过混淆，导致模型性能显著下降。为填补这一空白，本文首先评估了当前最先进模型在低可读性代码上的鲁棒性，发现包括GPT-4o和DeepSeek-V3在内的模型面对此类代码时性能均大幅下降，而提示工程和推理增强模型带来的改进有限，从而驱动了鲁棒性增强方法的研究。

Method: 提出的RoFTCodeSum方法融合了课程学习与元学习：基于原始微调数据集，创建具有渐进式理解难度的课程训练集（例如，分别对代码中的函数名和标识符进行混淆）。在每一步训练中，该方法利用这些逐渐变难的训练集进行元梯度更新，从而同时优化模型在原始代码上的准确性及对低可读性代码的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果显示，RoFTCodeSum在保持甚至提升原始代码上性能的同时，显著增强了对语义扰动的鲁棒性。这验证了该方法能够有效应对因代码混淆或结构劣化而导致的模型性能退化问题。

Conclusion: RoFTCodeSum为代码摘要任务提供了一种可同时提升准确性和鲁棒性的有效微调策略，特别适用于处理现实世界中常见的低可读性代码场景。该方法通过渐进式难度训练与元学习的结合，为提升代码语言模型在实际应用中的稳健性提供了新的途径。

Abstract: Code summarization has emerged as a fundamental technique in the field of program comprehension. While code language models have shown significant advancements, the current models and benchmarks are confined to high-readability code, which contains sufficient semantic cues such as function and variable names. In the real world, however, code is often poorly structured or obfuscated, significantly degrading model performance. In this paper, we first empirically evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art language models on poor-readability code for the task of code summarization, focusing on (1) their effectiveness, (2) the impact of prompt engineering, and (3) the robustness of different variants. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art models-including GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 experience a substantial performance drop when faced with poorly readable code, and that prompt engineering and reasoning-enhanced models offer limited improvements. Motivated by these findings, we propose RoFTCodeSum, a novel fine-tuning method that enhances the robustness of code summarization against poorly readable code. RoFTCodeSum marries the concepts of curriculum learning and meta-learning: based on the original dataset for fine-tuning, it creates curricular training sets, e.g., obfuscating function names and identifiers from the code, respectively, that have progressive difficulty in code comprehension. In each training step, the approach meta-updates the gradients using these progressively challenging datasets, thereby optimizing both accuracy and readability robustness simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that RoFTCodeSum exhibits increased robustness against semantic perturbation while enhancing performance on the original code.

Abstract: Users demand fast, seamless webpage experiences, yet developers often struggle to meet these expectations within tight constraints. Performance optimization, while critical, is a time-consuming and often manual process. One of the most complex tasks in this domain is modifying the Document Object Model (DOM), which is why this study focuses on it. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue to automate this complex task, potentially transforming how developers address web performance issues. This study evaluates the effectiveness of nine state-of-the-art LLMs for automated web performance issue resolution. For this purpose, we first extracted the DOM trees of 15 popular webpages (e.g., Facebook), and then we used Lighthouse to retrieve their performance audit reports. Subsequently, we passed the extracted DOM trees and corresponding audits to each model for resolution. Our study considers 7 unique audit categories, revealing that LLMs universally excel at SEO & Accessibility issues. However, their efficacy in performance-critical DOM manipulations is mixed. While high-performing models like GPT-4.1 delivered significant reductions in areas like Initial Load, Interactivity, and Network Optimization (e.g., 46.52% to 48.68% audit incidence reductions), others, such as GPT-4o-mini, notably underperformed, consistently. A further analysis of these modifications showed a predominant additive strategy and frequent positional changes, alongside regressions particularly impacting Visual Stability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: LLM-integrated software, which embeds or interacts with large language models (LLMs) as functional components, exhibits probabilistic and context-dependent behaviors that fundamentally differ from those of traditional software. This shift introduces a new category of integration defects that arise not only from code errors but also from misaligned interactions among LLM-specific artifacts, including prompts, API calls, configurations, and model outputs. However, existing defect localization techniques are ineffective at identifying these LLM-specific integration defects because they fail to capture cross-layer dependencies across heterogeneous artifacts, cannot exploit incomplete or misleading error traces, and lack semantic reasoning capabilities for identifying root causes.
  To address these challenges, we propose LIDL, a multi-agent framework for defect localization in LLM-integrated software. LIDL (1) constructs a code knowledge graph enriched with LLM-aware annotations that represent interaction boundaries across source code, prompts, and configuration files, (2) fuses three complementary sources of error evidence inferred by LLMs to surface candidate defect locations, and (3) applies context-aware validation that uses counterfactual reasoning to distinguish true root causes from propagated symptoms. We evaluate LIDL on 146 real-world defect instances collected from 105 GitHub repositories and 16 agent-based systems. The results show that LIDL significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art baselines across all metrics, achieving a Top-3 accuracy of 0.64 and a MAP of 0.48, which represents a 64.1% improvement over the best-performing baseline. Notably, LIDL achieves these gains while reducing cost by 92.5%, demonstrating both high accuracy and cost efficiency.

Abstract: \underline{Context:} Logging is a fundamental yet complex practice in software engineering, essential for monitoring, debugging, and auditing software systems. With the increasing integration of machine learning (ML) components into software systems, effective logging has become critical to ensure reproducibility, traceability, and observability throughout model training and deployment. Although various general-purpose and ML-specific logging frameworks exist, little is known about how these tools are actually used in practice or whether ML practitioners adopt consistent and effective logging strategies. To date, no empirical study has systematically characterized recurring bad logging practices--or logging smells--in ML System. \underline{Goal:} This study aims to empirically identify and characterize logging smells in ML systems, providing an evidence-based understanding of how logging is implemented and challenged in practice. \underline{Method:} We propose to conduct a large-scale mining of open-source ML repositories hosted on GitHub to catalogue recurring logging smells. Subsequently, a practitioner survey involving ML engineers will be conducted to assess the perceived relevance, severity, and frequency of the identified smells. \underline{Limitations:} % While The study's limitations include that While our findings may not be generalizable to closed-source industrial projects, we believe our study provides an essential step toward understanding and improving logging practices in ML development.

TL;DR: LLMs能够根据自然语言提示生成反映预期行为的测试预言，但现有研究主要生成基于实现行为的回归预言，未能解决区分程序行为正确性的“预言问题”。本文通过实证研究评估LLMs生成暴露软件缺陷的测试预言的效果，探究不同提示策略和上下文输入水平对生成质量的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动化单元测试生成技术主要生成基于被测类已实现行为的回归预言，未能解决区分正确与错误程序行为的“预言问题”。随着基础模型（尤其是大语言模型）的兴起，出现了生成反映预期行为的测试预言的新机会，这使LLMs成为“提示工程”的推动者，其中软件创建和测试均由自然语言提示驱动。

Method: 进行实证研究，调查不同提示策略和上下文输入水平对LLM生成的测试预言质量的影响，评估LLMs生成暴露软件缺陷的测试预言的有效性。

Result: 研究结果揭示基于LLM的预言生成的优缺点，增进对其能力的理解，并为该领域的未来研究提供坚实基础。

Conclusion: 本研究为提高对LLM生成测试预言能力的理解提供了实证基础，为推动该领域未来研究奠定了基础，展示了LLMs在解决“预言问题”方面的潜力和局限性。

Abstract: Automated unit test generation aims to improve software quality while reducing the time and effort required for creating tests manually. However, existing techniques primarily generate regression oracles that predicate on the implemented behavior of the class under test. They do not address the oracle problem: the challenge of distinguishing correct from incorrect program behavior. With the rise of Foundation Models (FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a new opportunity to generate test oracles that reflect intended behavior. This positions LLMs as enablers of Promptware, where software creation and testing are driven by natural-language prompts. This paper presents an empirical study on the effectiveness of LLMs in generating test oracles that expose software failures. We investigate how different prompting strategies and levels of contextual input impact the quality of LLM-generated oracles. Our findings offer insights into the strengths and limitations of LLM-based oracle generation in the FM era, improving our understanding of their capabilities and fostering future research in this area.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: \textbf{Context:} Policy-as-Code (PaC) has become a foundational approach for embedding governance, compliance, and security requirements directly into software systems. While organizations increasingly adopt PaC tools, the software engineering community lacks an empirical understanding of how these tools are used in real-world development practices.
  \textbf{Objective:} This paper aims to bridge this gap by conducting the first large-scale study of PaC usage in open-source software. Our goal is to characterize how PaC tools are adopted, what purposes they serve, and what governance activities they support across diverse software ecosystems.
  \textbf{Method:} We analyzed 399 GitHub repositories using nine widely adopted PaC tools. Our mixed-methods approach combines quantitative analysis of tool usage and project characteristics with a qualitative investigation of policy files. We further employ a Large Language Model (LLM)--assisted classification pipeline, refined through expert validation, to derive a taxonomy of PaC usage consisting of 5 categories and 15 sub-categories.
  \textbf{Results:} Our study reveals substantial diversity in PaC adoption. PaC tools are frequently used in early-stage projects and are heavily oriented toward governance, configuration control, and documentation. We also observe emerging PaC usage in MLOps pipelines and strong co-usage patterns, such as between OPA and Gatekeeper. Our taxonomy highlights recurring governance intents.
  \textbf{Conclusion:} Our findings offer actionable insights for practitioners and tool developers. They highlight concrete usage patterns, emphasize actual PaC usage, and motivate opportunities for improving tool interoperability. This study lays the empirical foundation for future research on PaC practices and their role in ensuring trustworthy, compliant software systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Pharo offers a sophisticated completion engine based on semantic heuristics, which coordinates specific fetchers within a lazy architecture. These heuristics can be recomposed to support various activities (e.g., live programming or history usage navigation). While this system is powerful, it does not account for the repository structure when suggesting global names such as class names, class variables, or global variables. As a result, it does not prioritize classes within the same package or project, treating all global names equally. In this paper, we present a new heuristic that addresses this limitation. Our approach searches variable names in a structured manner: it begins with the package of the requesting class, then expands to other packages within the same repository, and finally considers the global namespace. We describe the logic behind this heuristic and evaluate it against the default semantic heuristic and one that directly queries the global namespace. Preliminary results indicate that the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) improves, confirming that package-awareness completions deliver more accurate and relevant suggestions than the previous flat global approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SBOM作为增强软件供应链透明度和安全性的重要工具，已有多个标准规范和生成工具，但缺乏对这些工具是否符合标准规范的系统性评估，这可能导致合规失败和SBOM使用中断。

Method: 采用两阶段实证分析方法：第一阶段基准评估和第二阶段一年期纵向跟踪评估。开发了自动化评估框架SAP，覆盖6个SBOM工具从3287个真实仓库生成的55444个SBOMs。

Result: 揭示当前SBOM工具的三大根本性局限性：1）对政策要求的合规支持不足；2）工具一致性差，跨语言包检测的跨工具一致性率低至7.84%-12.77%，工具自身版本间纵向不一致性显著；3）软件详细信息准确性中等或差，如包许可证准确性低于20%。

Conclusion: 当前SBOM工具在标准符合性方面存在系统性缺陷，分析了这些差距的根源并提供了实用解决方案。开源了所有代码、复制Docker镜像和评估结果，供进一步研究使用。

Abstract: A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a machine-readable artifact that systematically organizes software information, enhancing supply chain transparency and security. To facilitate the exchange and utilization of SBOMs, organizations such as the Linux Foundation and OWASP have proposed SBOM standards. Following standards, organizations have developed tools for generating and utilizing SBOMs. However, limited research has examined the adherence of these SBOM tools to standard specifications, a gap that could lead to compliance failures and disruptions in SBOM utilization. This paper presents the first large-scale, two-stage empirical analysis of the adherence gap, using our automated evaluation framework, SAP. The evaluation, comprising a baseline evaluation and a one-year longitudinal follow-up, covers 55,444 SBOMs generated by six SBOM tools from 3,287 real-world repositories. Our analysis reveals persistent, fundamental limitations in current SBOM tools: (1) inadequate compliance support with policy requirements; (2) poor tool consistencies, including inter-tool consistency rates as low as 7.84% to 12.77% for package detection across languages, and significant longitudinal inconsistency, where tools show low consistency with their own prior versions; and (3) mediocre to poor accuracy for detailed software information, e.g., accuracy of package licenses below 20%. We analyze the root causes of these gaps and provide practical solutions. All the code, replication docker image, evaluation results are open sourced at [GitHub](https://github.com/dw763j/SAP) and [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14998624) for further researches.

Abstract: The advent of transformer-based language models has reshaped how AI systems process and generate text. In software engineering (SE), these models now support diverse activities, accelerating automation and decision-making. Yet, evidence shows that these models can reproduce or amplify social biases, raising fairness concerns. Recent work on neuron editing has shown that internal activations in pre-trained transformers can be traced and modified to alter model behavior. Building on the concept of knowledge neurons, neurons that encode factual information, we hypothesize the existence of biased neurons that capture stereotypical associations within pre-trained transformers. To test this hypothesis, we build a dataset of biased relations, i.e., triplets encoding stereotypes across nine bias types, and adapt neuron attribution strategies to trace and suppress biased neurons in BERT models. We then assess the impact of suppression on SE tasks. Our findings show that biased knowledge is localized within small neuron subsets, and suppressing them substantially reduces bias with minimal performance loss. This demonstrates that bias in transformers can be traced and mitigated at the neuron level, offering an interpretable approach to fairness in SE.

TL;DR: Drivora是一个基于CARLA模拟器的统一可扩展自动驾驶系统搜索测试基础设施，通过统一场景定义、解耦测试引擎与执行、集成多种自动驾驶系统，解决现有测试方法框架异构和复用困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶系统测试方法存在严重框架异构问题，如场景空间不统一、模拟器不同、自动驾驶系统接口各异，导致在不同设置间复用和适配需要大量工作量。这种碎片化状态阻碍了测试方法的有效比较和应用。

Method: 1. 提出统一场景定义OpenScenario，使用低级可操作参数规范化场景描述；2. 解耦测试引擎、场景执行和自动驾驶系统集成三大模块；3. 测试引擎采用进化算法探索新场景，支持核心组件灵活定制；4. 场景执行采用并行机制最大化硬件利用率；5. 通过统一接口集成12个自动驾驶系统，简化新系统的接入过程。

Result: 开发了Drivora这一完整测试基础设施，基于广泛使用的CARLA模拟器，提供公开可用的工具集。该框架支持现有方法的兼容性，同时能够扩展到新的测试设计需求，如多自动驾驶车辆测试等复杂场景。

Conclusion: Drivora为自动驾驶系统的搜索测试提供了一个标准化、可扩展的基础设施，显著降低了测试方法在不同设置间的迁移成本，有望促进自动驾驶安全测试研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: Search-based testing is critical for evaluating the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems (ADSs). However, existing approaches are often built on heterogeneous frameworks (e.g., distinct scenario spaces, simulators, and ADSs), which require considerable effort to reuse and adapt across different settings. To address these challenges, we present Drivora, a unified and extensible infrastructure for search-based ADS testing built on the widely used CARLA simulator. Drivora introduces a unified scenario definition, OpenScenario, that specifies scenarios using low-level, actionable parameters to ensure compatibility with existing methods while supporting extensibility to new testing designs (e.g., multi-autonomous-vehicle testing). On top of this, Drivora decouples the testing engine, scenario execution, and ADS integration. The testing engine leverages evolutionary computation to explore new scenarios and supports flexible customization of core components. The scenario execution can run arbitrary scenarios using a parallel execution mechanism that maximizes hardware utilization for large-scale batch simulation. For ADS integration, Drivora provides access to 12 ADSs through a unified interface, streamlining configuration and simplifying the incorporation of new ADSs. Our tools are publicly available at https://github.com/MingfeiCheng/Drivora.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of complex AI systems has outpaced the development of tools to ensure their transparency, security, and regulatory compliance. In this paper, the AI Bill of Materials (AIBOM), an extension of the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), is introduced as a standardized, verifiable record of trained AI models and their environments. Our proof-of-concept platform, AIBoMGen, automates the generation of signed AIBOMs by capturing datasets, model metadata, and environment details during training. The training platform acts as a neutral, third-party observer and root of trust. It enforces verifiable AIBOM creation for every job. The system uses cryptographic hashing, digital signatures, and in-toto attestations to ensure integrity and protect against threats such as artifact tampering by dishonest model creators. Our evaluation demonstrates that AIBoMGen reliably detects unauthorized modifications to all artifacts and can generate AIBOMs with negligible performance overhead. These results highlight the potential of AIBoMGen as a foundational step toward building secure and transparent AI ecosystems, enabling compliance with regulatory frameworks like the EUs AI Act.

TL;DR: 本文首次应用检索增强生成(RAG)方法，利用议题跟踪系统数据生成软件行为解释，在GitHub议题上实现90%与人工解释的一致性，验证了从结构化开发知识中生成可靠解释的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件系统日益复杂，其行为理解变得困难，需要可解释性提升透明度和用户信任。传统文档常过时或不完整，而议题跟踪系统包含丰富且持续更新的开发知识，但其可解释性潜力尚未开发。

Method: 采用检索增强生成(RAG)方法，从议题跟踪数据生成解释。系统使用开源工具和语言模型实现，作为概念验证，利用结构化议题数据进行解释生成。

Result: 在示例项目的GitHub议题集上评估，实现90%与人工编写解释的对齐率。系统表现出强大的忠实性和指令遵循性，确保可靠且基于事实的解释。

Conclusion: RAG方法可将可解释性扩展至更广泛的软件系统，前提是有可用的议题跟踪数据，使系统行为更易访问和解释。这一发现为利用开发知识提升软件透明度提供了新途径。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern software systems has made understanding their behavior increasingly challenging, driving the need for explainability to improve transparency and user trust. Traditional documentation is often outdated or incomplete, making it difficult to derive accurate, context-specific explanations. Meanwhile, issue-tracking systems capture rich and continuously updated development knowledge, but their potential for explainability remains untapped. With this work, we are the first to apply a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach for generating explanations from issue-tracking data. Our proof-of-concept system is implemented using open-source tools and language models, demonstrating the feasibility of leveraging structured issue data for explanation generation. Evaluating our approach on an exemplary project's set of GitHub issues, we achieve 90% alignment with human-written explanations. Additionally, our system exhibits strong faithfulness and instruction adherence, ensuring reliable and grounded explanations. These findings suggest that RAG-based methods can extend explainability beyond black-box ML models to a broader range of software systems, provided that issue-tracking data is available - making system behavior more accessible and interpretable.

TL;DR: StriderSPD是一个结构引导的二进制安全补丁检测框架，结合了图分支和大语言模型，并通过适配器对齐汇编代码与伪代码的表征


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全补丁检测研究主要针对开源软件，而闭源软件的补丁以二进制形式分发，缺乏可访问的源代码。现有的二进制SPD方法通常将二进制提升到汇编代码或伪代码抽象层次，但汇编代码语义有限，伪代码缺乏可解析的语法，两者都难以准确学习漏洞修复表示。此外，先前研究常使用同一项目的训练和测试数据进行评估，无法反映闭源环境

Method: StriderSPD采用结构引导的联合表示框架，将图分支集成到大语言模型中，利用结构信息指导LLM识别安全补丁。设计了图分支中的适配器来在LLM的token级别上对齐汇编代码与伪代码的表征。采用两阶段训练策略解决两个分支间参数规模不平衡导致的优化问题，并构建了项目域分离的二进制SPD基准数据集进行真实评估

Result: 论文在构建的新基准数据集上进行了广泛评估，展示了StriderSPD的有效性

Conclusion: StriderSPD通过结构引导的联合表示框架解决了二进制安全补丁检测面临的核心挑战，包括有限语义的汇编代码、缺乏语法的伪代码，以及训练测试数据重叠问题，为闭源软件环境提供了有效的补丁检测方案

Abstract: Vulnerabilities severely threaten software systems, making the timely application of security patches crucial for mitigating attacks. However, software vendors often silently patch vulnerabilities with limited disclosure, where Security Patch Detection (SPD) comes to protect software assets. Recently, most SPD studies have targeted Open-Source Software (OSS), yet a large portion of real-world software is closed-source, where patches are distributed as binaries without accessible source code. The limited binary SPD approaches often lift binaries to abstraction levels, i.e., assembly code or pseudo-code. However, assembly code is register-based instructions conveying limited semantics, while pseudo-code lacks parser-compatible grammar to extract structure, both hindering accurate vulnerability-fix representation learning. In addition, previous studies often obtain training and testing data from the same project for evaluation, which fails to reflect closed-source conditions. To alleviate the above challenges, we propose \textbf{\textit{StriderSPD}}, a \underline{Str}ucture-gu\underline{ide}d joint \underline{r}epresentation \underline{SPD} framework of binary code that integrates a graph branch into a large language model (LLM), leveraging structural information to guide the LLM in identifying security patches. Our novel design of the adapters in the graph branch effectively aligns the representations between assembly code and pseudo-code at the LLM's token level. We further present a two-stage training strategy to address the optimization imbalance caused by the large parameter disparity between StriderSPD's two branches, which enables proper branch fitting. To enable more realistic evaluation, we construct a binary SPD benchmark that is disjoint from prior datasets in both projects and domains and extensively evaluate StriderSPD on this benchmark.

Motivation: DeFi质押是DeFi生态系统中最突出的应用之一，但其中存在的逻辑缺陷可能导致攻击者通过操纵奖励金额、重复领取奖励等方式获取不正当收益。目前缺乏针对DeFi质押逻辑缺陷的系统性研究和检测方法。

Method: 1. 通过分析64个安全事件和144份审计报告，识别出6种不同类型的逻辑缺陷；2. 开发SSR工具，利用大语言模型提取质押逻辑信息并构建DeFi质押模型，通过分析模型和语义特征检测逻辑缺陷；3. 构建基于已知安全事件和审计报告的真实数据集进行效果评估；4. 在15,992个DeFi质押合约的大规模数据集中评估缺陷普遍性。

Result: 1. SSR工具的整体精度为92.31%，召回率为87.92%，F1分数为88.85%；2. 在15,992个DeFi质押合约中，SSR检测到3,557个（22.24%）合约至少包含一个逻辑缺陷。

Conclusion: 论文首次系统定义了DeFi质押中的逻辑缺陷并开发了有效的检测工具SSR，通过实证研究揭示了逻辑缺陷在真实世界DeFi合约中的普遍存在性，为DeFi质押安全提供了重要的研究基础和实践指导。

Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) staking is one of the most prominent applications within the DeFi ecosystem, where DeFi projects enable users to stake tokens on the platform and reward participants with additional tokens. However, logical defects in DeFi staking could enable attackers to claim unwarranted rewards by manipulating reward amounts, repeatedly claiming rewards, or engaging in other malicious actions. To mitigate these threats, we conducted the first study focused on defining and detecting logical defects in DeFi staking. Through the analysis of 64 security incidents and 144 audit reports, we identified six distinct types of logical defects, each accompanied by detailed descriptions and code examples. Building on this empirical research, we developed SSR (Safeguarding Staking Reward), a static analysis tool designed to detect logical defects in DeFi staking contracts. SSR utilizes a large language model (LLM) to extract fundamental information about staking logic and constructs a DeFi staking model. It then identifies logical defects by analyzing the model and the associated semantic features. We constructed a ground truth dataset based on known security incidents and audit reports to evaluate the effectiveness of SSR. The results indicate that SSR achieves an overall precision of 92.31%, a recall of 87.92%, and an F1-score of 88.85%. Additionally, to assess the prevalence of logical defects in real-world smart contracts, we compiled a large-scale dataset of 15,992 DeFi staking contracts. SSR detected that 3,557 (22.24%) of these contracts contained at least one logical defect.

Abstract: Translating legacy C codebases to Rust is increasingly demanded for building safety-critical systems. While various approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs: rule-based methods often struggle to satisfy code safety and idiomaticity requirements, while LLM-based methods frequently fail to generate semantically equivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the entire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited to small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated framework for converting complete C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust employs a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation. The pipeline consists of three stages: 1) it first decomposes the C project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to transform definitions and macros, and generates type-checked function stubs, which form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates functions, replacing the corresponding stub placeholders; 3) finally, it repairs compilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary augmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and LLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six industrial projects demonstrates the superior performance of EvoC2Rust in project-level C-to-Rust translation. The results show that our approach outperforms the strongest LLM-based baseline by 17.24% in syntax accuracy and 14.32% in semantic accuracy, while also achieving a 43.59% higher code safety rate than the best rule-based tool.

Abstract: Maintaining spatial data (points in two or three dimensions) is crucial and has a wide range of applications, such as graphics, GIS, and robotics. To handle spatial data, many data structures, called spatial indexes, have been proposed, e.g. kd-trees, oct/quadtrees (also called Orth-trees), R-trees, and bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs). In real-world applications, spatial datasets tend to be highly dynamic, requiring batch updates of points with low latency. This calls for efficient parallel batch updates on spatial indexes. Unfortunately, there is very little work that achieves this.
  In this paper, we systematically study parallel spatial indexes, with a special focus on achieving high-performance update performance for highly dynamic workloads. We select two types of spatial indexes that are considered optimized for low-latency updates: Orth-tree and R-tree/BVH. We propose two data structures: the P-Orth tree, a parallel Orth-tree, and the SPaC-tree family, a parallel R-tree/BVH. Both the P-Orth tree and the SPaC-tree deliver superior performance in batch updates compared to existing parallel kd-trees and Orth-trees, while preserving better or competitive query performance relative to their corresponding Orth-tree and R-tree counterparts. We also present comprehensive experiments comparing the performance of various parallel spatial indexes and share our findings at the end of the paper.

Abstract: Modern database systems allow users to query or process unstructured text or document columns using LLM-powered functions. Users can express an operation in natural language (e.g., "identify if this review mentions billing issues"), with the system executing the operation on each document, in a row-by-row fashion. One way to reduce cost on a batch of documents is to employ the model cascade framework: a cheap proxy model processes each document, and only uncertain cases are escalated to a more accurate, expensive oracle. However, model cascades miss important optimization opportunities; for example, often only part of a document is needed to answer a query, or other related, but simpler operations (e.g., "is the review sentiment negative?", "does the review mention money?") can be handled by cheap models more effectively than the original operation, while still being correlated with it.
  We introduce the task cascades framework, which generalizes model cascades by varying not just the model, but also the document portion and operation at each stage. Our framework uses an LLM agent to generate simplified, decomposed, or otherwise related operations and selects the most relevant document portions, constructing hundreds of candidate tasks from which it assembles a task cascade. We show that optimal cascade selection is intractable via reduction from Minimum Sum Set Cover, but our iterative approach constructs effective cascades. We also provide an extension that offers statistical accuracy guarantees: the resulting cascade meets a user-defined accuracy target (with respect to the oracle) up to a bounded failure probability. Across eight real-world document processing tasks at a 90% target accuracy, task cascades reduce end-to-end cost by an average of 36% compared to model cascades, at a production scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SQL方言翻译工具依赖人工规则，难以支持新的RDBMS，且LLM在处理长复杂SQL查询时性能不佳。

Method: 1.方言感知查询简化：移除方言无关SQL元素；2.LLM翻译简化查询；3.自动提取翻译规则；4.应用规则到原始查询。

Result: 在TPC-DS和SQLProcBench上分别达到97.98%和100%的准确率，相比基线平均提升24.62%和238.41%。

Conclusion: RISE通过简化-翻译-规则提取的框架，有效解决了LLM在复杂SQL方言翻译中的局限性，显著提升了翻译准确率。

Abstract: Translating SQL dialects across different relational database management systems (RDBMSs) is crucial for migrating RDBMS-based applications to the cloud. Traditional SQL dialect translation tools rely on manually-crafted rules, necessitating significant manual effort to support new RDBMSs and dialects. Although large language models (LLMs) can assist in translating SQL dialects, they often struggle with lengthy and complex SQL queries.
  In this paper, we propose RISE, a novel LLM-based SQL dialect translation approach that can accurately handle lengthy and complex SQL queries. Given a complex source query $Q_c$ that contains a SQL dialect $d$, we first employ a dialect-aware query reduction technique to derive a simplified query $Q_{s}$ by removing $d$-irrelevant SQL elements from $Q_c$. Subsequently, we utilize LLMs to translate $Q_{s}$ into $Q_{s^{'}}$, and automatically extract the translation rule $r_d$ for dialect $d$ based on the relationship between $Q_{s}$ and $Q_{s^{'}}$. By applying $r_d$ to $Q_c$, we can effectively translate the dialect $d$ within $Q_c$, thereby bypassing the complexity of the source query $Q_c$. We evaluate RISE on two real-world benchmarks, i.e., TPC-DS and SQLProcBench, comparing its performance against both the traditional rule-based tools and the LLM-based approaches with respect to translation accuracy. RISE achieves accuracies of 97.98% on TPC-DS and 100% on SQLProcBench, outperforming the baselines by an average improvement of 24.62% and 238.41%, respectively.

Motivation: 回答关于排序函数中输入列权重重要性的解释性问题，为数据库中的排名可解释性提供理论基础。

Method: 采用Grohe等人框架，分析三种组件组合的计算复杂性：1) 排名函数（字典序和基于求和/最小/最大函数的评分排序），2) 效应函数（全局、top-k和局部视角），3) 独立有限权重分布。

Result: 所有情况都允许加法FPRAS近似，但精确计算显示多项式时间可解和#P难的复杂情况。复杂度结果也扩展到计算整个列（与其权重无关）的Shapley值。

Conclusion: 对排名函数的SHAP分数计算复杂性进行了系统分类，为数据库排名解释机制的理论和实践提供了重要基础。

Abstract: How important is the weight of a given column in determining the ranking of tuples in a table? To address such an explanation question about a ranking function, we investigate the computation of SHAP scores for column weights, adopting a recent framework by Grohe et al.[ICDT'24]. The exact definition of this score depends on three key components: (1) the ranking function in use, (2) an effect function that quantifies the impact of using alternative weights on the ranking, and (3) an underlying weight distribution. We analyze the computational complexity of different instantiations of this framework for a range of fundamental ranking and effect functions, focusing on probabilistically independent finite distributions for individual columns.
  For the ranking functions, we examine lexicographic orders and score-based orders defined by the summation, minimum, and maximum functions. For the effect functions, we consider global, top-k, and local perspectives: global measures quantify the divergence between the perturbed and original rankings, top-k measures inspect the change in the set of top-k answers, and local measures capture the impact on an individual tuple of interest. Although all cases admit an additive fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS), we establish the complexity of exact computation, identifying which cases are solvable in polynomial time and which are #P-hard. We further show that all complexity results, lower bounds and upper bounds, extend to a related task of computing the Shapley value of whole columns (regardless of their weight).

We provide an implementation covering a wide range of queries and orders; it allows us to investigate intriguing practical aspects, including the comparative performance of database systems and the relationship between direct access and its single-access counterpart.

Motivation: 现代混合专家模型中普遍存在的'内存墙'瓶颈问题，MoE固有的架构稀疏性导致稀疏计算的同时引入了巨大的激活内存开销，这限制了GPU上的最大批处理规模和序列长度，且带来了过多的数据移动，阻碍了性能和模型扩展效率。

Method: MoEBlaze框架采用了协同设计的系统方法：(i) 端到端的令牌调度与MoE训练方法，使用优化的数据结构消除中间缓冲区和激活物的实例化；(ii) 协同设计的内核配合智能激活检查点，在减少内存占用的同时实现更好的性能。

Result: 与现有MoE框架相比，MoEBlaze可实现超过4倍的速度提升和超过50%的内存节省。

Conclusion: MoEBlaze通过消除中间缓冲、优化数据结构和使用智能激活检查点的协同设计，有效解决了MoE训练中的内存瓶颈问题，显著提升了训练效率和模型扩展能力。

Abstract: The pervasive "memory wall" bottleneck is significantly amplified in modern large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. MoE's inherent architectural sparsity leads to sparse arithmetic compute and also introduces substantial activation memory overheads -- driven by large token routing buffers and the need to materialize and buffer intermediate tensors. This memory pressure limits the maximum batch size and sequence length that can fit on GPUs, and also results in excessive data movements that hinders performance and efficient model scaling. We present MoEBlaze, a memory-efficient MoE training framework that addresses these issues through a co-designed system approach: (i) an end-to-end token dispatch and MoE training method with optimized data structures to eliminate intermediate buffers and activation materializing, and (ii) co-designed kernels with smart activation checkpoint to mitigate memory footprint while simultaneously achieving better performance. We demonstrate that MoEBlaze can achieve over 4x speedups and over 50% memory savings compared to existing MoE frameworks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reasoning oriented large language models often expose explicit "thinking" as long, turn-global traces at the start of every response, either always on or toggled externally at inference time. While useful for arithmetic, programming, and problem solving, this design is costly, blurs claim level auditability, and cannot re-trigger explicit reasoning once the model begins presenting. Dialogue models are also largely blind to temporal structure, treating replies after seconds and replies after weeks as equivalent unless time is stated in text. We introduce TIME, the Temporally Intelligent Meta-reasoning Engine, a behavioral alignment framework that treats explicit reasoning as a context sensitive resource driven by discourse and temporal cues. TIME augments dialogue with optional ISO 8601 <time> tags, tick turns that represent silent gaps, and short <think> blocks that can appear anywhere in a reply. A four-phase curriculum including a small, maximally diverse full-batch alignment step trains Qwen3 dense models to invoke brief, in-place reasoning bursts and keep user facing text compact. We evaluate with TIMEBench, a temporally grounded dialogue benchmark probing chronology, commonsense under gaps and offsets, anomaly detection, and continuity. Across 4B to 32B scales, TIME improves TIMEBench scores over base Qwen3 in both thinking and no-thinking modes while reducing reasoning tokens by about an order of magnitude. Our training data and code are available at https://github.com/The-Coherence-Initiative/TIME and TIMEBench is available at https://github.com/The-Coherence-Initiative/TIMEBench

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic reasoning systems face fundamental challenges in maintaining semantic coherence while satisfying physical and logical constraints. Building upon our previous work on Ontology Neural Networks, we present an enhanced framework that integrates topological conditioning with gradient stabilization mechanisms. The approach employs Forman-Ricci curvature to capture graph topology, Deep Delta Learning for stable rank-one perturbations during constraint projection, and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy for parameter optimization. Experimental evaluation across multiple problem sizes demonstrates that the method achieves mean energy reduction to 1.15 compared to baseline values of 11.68, with 95 percent success rate in constraint satisfaction tasks. The framework exhibits seed-independent convergence and graceful scaling behavior up to twenty-node problems, suggesting that topological structure can inform gradient-based optimization without sacrificing interpretability or computational efficiency.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative distributed learning paradigm, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model under the coordination of a central server without sharing their raw training data. While FL offers notable advantages, it faces critical challenges in ensuring fairness across diverse demographic groups. To address these fairness concerns, various fairness-aware debiasing methods have been proposed. However, many of these approaches either require modifications to clients' training protocols or lack flexibility in their aggregation strategies. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing EquFL, a novel server-side debiasing method designed to mitigate bias in FL systems. EquFL operates by allowing the server to generate a single calibrated update after receiving model updates from the clients. This calibrated update is then integrated with the aggregated client updates to produce an adjusted global model that reduces bias. Theoretically, we establish that EquFL converges to the optimal global model achieved by FedAvg and effectively reduces fairness loss over training rounds. Empirically, we demonstrate that EquFL significantly mitigates bias within the system, showcasing its practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) regression is a powerful nonparametric Bayesian framework, but its performance depends critically on the choice of covariance kernel. Selecting an appropriate kernel is therefore central to model quality, yet remains one of the most challenging and computationally expensive steps in probabilistic modeling. We present a Bayesian optimization framework built on kernel-of-kernels geometry, using expected divergence-based distances between GP priors to explore kernel space efficiently. A multidimensional scaling (MDS) embedding of this distance matrix maps a discrete kernel library into a continuous Euclidean manifold, enabling smooth BO. In this formulation, the input space comprises kernel compositions, the objective is the log marginal likelihood, and featurization is given by the MDS coordinates. When the divergence yields a valid metric, the embedding preserves geometry and produces a stable BO landscape. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic benchmarks, real-world time-series datasets, and an additive manufacturing case study predicting melt-pool geometry, achieving superior predictive accuracy and uncertainty calibration relative to baselines including Large Language Model (LLM)-guided search. This framework establishes a reusable probabilistic geometry for kernel search, with direct relevance to GP modeling and deep kernel learning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Non-injective functions are not invertible. However, non-injective functions can be restricted to sub-domains on which they are locally injective and surjective and thus invertible if the dimensionality between input and output spaces are the same. Further, even if the dimensionalities do not match it is often possible to choose a preferred solution from many possible solutions. Twin neural network regression is naturally capable of incorporating these properties to invert non-injective functions. Twin neural network regression is trained to predict adjustments to well known input variables $\mathbf{x}^{\text{anchor}}$ to obtain an estimate for an unknown $\mathbf{x}^{\text{new}}$ under a change of the target variable from $\mathbf{y}^{\text{anchor}}$ to $\mathbf{y}^{\text{new}}$. In combination with k-nearest neighbor search, I propose a deterministic framework that finds input parameters to a given target variable of non-injective functions. The method is demonstrated by inverting non-injective functions describing toy problems and robot arm control that are a) defined by data or b) known as mathematical formula.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) provides a data-driven framework for approximating policies for large-scale combinatorial optimisation problems formulated as sequential decision problems (SDPs), where exact solution methods are computationally intractable. A central but underexplored aspect of IL in this context is the role of the \emph{expert} that generates training demonstrations. Existing studies employ a wide range of expert constructions, yet lack a unifying framework to characterise their modelling assumptions, computational properties, and impact on learning performance.
  This paper introduces a systematic taxonomy of experts for IL in combinatorial optimisation under uncertainty. Experts are classified along three dimensions: (i) their treatment of uncertainty, including myopic, deterministic, full-information, two-stage stochastic, and multi-stage stochastic formulations; (ii) their level of optimality, distinguishing task-optimal and approximate experts; and (iii) their interaction mode with the learner, ranging from one-shot supervision to iterative, interactive schemes. Building on this taxonomy, we propose a generalised Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) algorithm that supports multiple expert queries, expert aggregation, and flexible interaction strategies.
  The proposed framework is evaluated on a dynamic physician-to-patient assignment problem with stochastic arrivals and capacity constraints. Computational experiments compare learning outcomes across expert types and interaction regimes. The results show that policies learned from stochastic experts consistently outperform those learned from deterministic or full-information experts, while interactive learning improves solution quality using fewer expert demonstrations. Aggregated deterministic experts provide an effective alternative when stochastic optimisation becomes computationally challenging.

Motivation: MARL中的知识蒸馏传统方法面临三个关键瓶颈：(1)在复杂领域合成高性能教学策略的挑战；(2)教师必须在OOD状态进行推理的困难；(3)分散学生和集中教师的观测空间不匹配。这些限制了知识蒸馏在MARL中的实际应用效果。

Conclusion: HINT框架通过解决知识蒸馏在MARL中的三大核心挑战，显著提升了多智能体强化学习的训练效率和性能，为集中训练-分散执行设置提供了一种有效的知识蒸馏解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has the potential to accelerate MARL by employing a centralized teacher for decentralized students but faces key bottlenecks. Specifically, there are (1) challenges in synthesizing high-performing teaching policies in complex domains, (2) difficulties when teachers must reason in out-of-distribution (OOD) states, and (3) mismatches between the decentralized students' and the centralized teacher's observation spaces. To address these limitations, we propose HINT (Hierarchical INteractive Teacher-based transfer), a novel KD framework for MARL in a centralized training, decentralized execution setup. By leveraging hierarchical RL, HINT provides a scalable, high-performing teacher. Our key innovation, pseudo off-policy RL, enables the teacher policy to be updated using both teacher and student experience, thereby improving OOD adaptation. HINT also applies performance-based filtering to retain only outcome-relevant guidance, reducing observation mismatches. We evaluate HINT on challenging cooperative domains (e.g., FireCommander for resource allocation, MARINE for tactical combat). Across these benchmarks, HINT outperforms baselines, achieving improvements of 60% to 165% in success rate.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automatic evaluators of generative AI outputs, a paradigm often referred to as "LLM-as-a-judge." In practice, LLM judges are imperfect predictions for the underlying truth and can exhibit systematic, non-random errors. Two main approaches have recently been proposed to address this issue: (i) direct measurementerror correction based on misclassification models such as Rogan-Gladen-style estimators, and (ii) surrogate-outcome approaches such as prediction-powered inference (PPI), which correct bias by calibrating prediction residuals on a small set of gold-standard human labels. In this paper, we systematically study the performance of these two approaches for estimating mean parameters (e.g., average benchmark scores or pairwise win rates). Leveraging tools from semiparametric efficiency theory, we unify the two classes of estimators by deriving explicit forms of efficient influence function (EIF)-based efficient estimators and characterize conditions under which PPI-style estimators attain strictly smaller asymptotic variance than measurement-error corrections. We verify our theoretical results in simulations and demonstrate the methods on real-data examples. We provide an implementation of the benchmarked methods and comparison utilities at https://github.com/yiqunchen/debias-llm-as-a-judge.

Abstract: Accurately assessing the potential for fault slip is essential in many subsurface operations. Conventional model-based history matching methods, which entail the generation of posterior geomodels calibrated to observed data, can be challenging to apply in coupled flow-geomechanics problems with faults. In this work, we implement a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based data-space inversion (DSI) framework to predict pressure, stress and strain fields, and fault slip tendency, in CO${_2}$ storage projects. The main computations required by the DSI workflow entail the simulation of O(1000) prior geomodels. The posterior distributions for quantities of interest are then inferred directly from prior simulation results and observed data, without the need to generate posterior geomodels. The model used here involves a synthetic 3D system with two faults. Realizations of heterogeneous permeability and porosity fields are generated using geostatistical software, and uncertain geomechanical and fault parameters are sampled for each realization from prior distributions. Coupled flow-geomechanics simulations for these geomodels are conducted using GEOS. A VAE with stacked convolutional long short-term memory layers is trained, using the prior simulation results, to represent pressure, strain, effective normal stress and shear stress fields in terms of latent variables. The VAE parameterization is used with DSI for posterior predictions, with monitoring wells providing observed pressure and strain data. Posterior results for synthetic true models demonstrate that the DSI-VAE framework gives accurate predictions for pressure, strain, and stress fields and for fault slip tendency. The framework is also shown to reduce uncertainty in key geomechanical and fault parameters.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-SQL systems have been driven by larger models and improved datasets, yet progress is still limited by the scarcity of high-quality training data. Manual data creation is expensive, and existing synthetic methods trade off reliability and scalability. Template-based approaches ensure correct SQL but require schema-specific templates, while LLM-based generation scales easily but lacks quality and correctness guarantees. We introduce RingSQL, a hybrid data generation framework that combines schema-independent query templates with LLM-based paraphrasing of natural language questions. This approach preserves SQL correctness across diverse schemas while providing broad linguistic variety. In our experiments, we find that models trained using data produced by RingSQL achieve an average gain in accuracy of +2.3% across six text-to-SQL benchmarks when compared to models trained on other synthetic data. We make our code available at https://github.com/nu-c3lab/RingSQL.

Abstract: Recently, differentiable causal discovery has emerged as a promising approach to improve the accuracy and efficiency of existing methods. However, when applied to high-dimensional data or data with latent confounders, these methods, often based on off-the-shelf continuous optimization algorithms, struggle with the vast search space, the complexity of the objective function, and the nontrivial nature of graph-theoretical constraints. As a result, there has been a surge of interest in leveraging super-structures to guide the optimization process. Nonetheless, learning an appropriate super-structure at the right level of granularity, and doing so efficiently across various settings, presents significant challenges.
  In this paper, we propose ALVGL, a novel and general enhancement to the differentiable causal discovery pipeline. ALVGL employs a sparse and low-rank decomposition to learn the precision matrix of the data. We design an ADMM procedure to optimize this decomposition, identifying components in the precision matrix that are most relevant to the underlying causal structure. These components are then combined to construct a super-structure that is provably a superset of the true causal graph. This super-structure is used to initialize a standard differentiable causal discovery method with a more focused search space, thereby improving both optimization efficiency and accuracy.
  We demonstrate the versatility of ALVGL by instantiating it across a range of structural causal models, including both Gaussian and non-Gaussian settings, with and without unmeasured confounders. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that ALVGL not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also significantly improves optimization efficiency, making it a reliable and effective solution for differentiable causal discovery.

TL;DR: MaxCode通过统一搜索方法的强化学习框架，结合自然语言批判模型和执行反馈，提升LLM代码优化能力，在CUDA和C++基准测试中取得显著性能改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理通用编码任务时表现出色，但在代码优化方面面临两大挑战：一是编写优化代码（如高性能CUDA内核和竞赛级CPU代码）需要系统、算法和特定语言的专业知识；二是需要理解超越二进制正确性的性能指标（如计时和设备利用率）。

Method: 提出MaxCode方法，将现有搜索方法统一到最大奖励强化学习框架下，使观测和动作价值函数模块化可修改。通过自然语言批判模型将原始执行反馈转化为错误和性能瓶颈的诊断洞察，结合迄今最佳折扣奖励，丰富代码提案函数的输入。在搜索过程中，使用滚动采样的动作价值训练生成式reward-to-go模型来重新排序潜在解决方案。

Result: 在KernelBench（CUDA）和PIE（C++）优化基准测试中，MaxCode相比基线在绝对加速值和相对加速排名上分别实现了20.3%和10.1%的相对改进。

Conclusion: MaxCode通过统一的强化学习框架整合执行反馈和自然语言分析，有效提升了大语言模型在复杂代码优化任务中的性能，为解决专业级代码优化问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in general coding tasks but encounter two key challenges when optimizing code: (i) the complexity of writing optimized code (such as performant CUDA kernels and competition-level CPU code) requires expertise in systems, algorithms and specific languages and (ii) requires interpretation of performance metrics like timing and device utilization beyond binary correctness. In this work, we explore inference-time search algorithms that guide the LLM to discover better solutions through iterative refinement based on execution feedback. Our approach, called MaxCode unifies existing search methods under a max-reward reinforcement learning framework, making the observation and action-value functions modular for modification. To enhance the observation space, we integrate a natural language critique model that converts raw execution feedback into diagnostic insights about errors and performance bottlenecks, and the best-discounted reward seen so far. Together, these provide richer input to the code proposal function. To improve exploration during search, we train a generative reward-to-go model using action values from rollouts to rerank potential solutions. Testing on the KernelBench (CUDA) and PIE (C++) optimization benchmarks shows that MaxCode improves optimized code performance compared to baselines, achieving 20.3% and 10.1% relative improvements in absolute speedup value and relative speedup ranking, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出Hi-ZFO分层优化框架，结合零阶和一阶方法优势，针对LLM微调中梯度方法易陷局部最优、零阶方法收敛慢的问题，通过重要性分析分层应用不同优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准一阶优化（如SGD）在微调大语言模型时容易陷入尖锐、泛化性差的局部极小值；而零阶方法虽具探索性，但收敛缓慢，且在生成任务中由于输出空间巨大导致估计方差大、效率低下。

Method: 提出Hi-ZFO分层优化框架：通过层重要性分析自适应划分模型，对关键层使用精确一阶梯度更新，对不敏感层使用零阶优化，其中零阶优化不仅是内存节省替代方案，更被设计为提供'有益随机性'帮助逃离局部极小值。

Result: 在多种生成、数学和代码推理任务上进行验证，Hi-ZFO始终获得更优性能，同时显著减少训练时间。

Conclusion: 分层混合优化方法能有效解决LLM微调中的优化难题，结合了一阶方法的精度和零阶方法的探索能力，提高了训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using standard first-order (FO) optimization often drives training toward sharp, poorly generalizing minima. Conversely, zeroth-order (ZO) methods offer stronger exploratory behavior without relying on explicit gradients, yet suffer from slow convergence. More critically, our analysis reveals that in generative tasks, the vast output and search space significantly amplify estimation variance, rendering ZO methods both noisy and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Hi-ZFO} (\textbf{Hi}erarchical \textbf{Z}eroth- and \textbf{F}irst-\textbf{O}rder optimization), a hybrid framework designed to synergize the precision of FO gradients with the exploratory capability of ZO estimation. Hi-ZFO adaptively partitions the model through layer-wise importance profiling, applying precise FO updates to critical layers while leveraging ZO optimization for less sensitive ones. Notably, ZO in Hi-ZFO is not merely a memory-saving surrogate; it is intentionally introduced as a source of "beneficial stochasticity" to help the model escape the local minima where pure FO optimization tends to stagnate. Validated across diverse generative, mathematical, and code reasoning tasks, Hi-ZFO consistently achieves superior performance while significantly reducing the training time. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical hybrid optimization for LLM fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 该研究系统评估了检索增强大语言模型中的过度搜索问题，提出了量化指标TPC，并发布数据集以促进高效检索增强LLMs研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强大语言模型在执行知识密集型任务时经常过度搜索——在不需要外部检索时也调用搜索工具，导致计算效率低下和因纳入无关上下文而产生幻觉。缺乏对这一问题系统性评估阻碍了高效检索模型的开发。

Method: 从多个维度系统评估过度搜索现象，包括查询类型（可回答vs不可回答）、模型类别、检索条件（干净vs带有噪声的检索）和多轮对话。引入TPC（每正确率所需令牌数）指标量化性能-成本权衡，并研究查询层面和检索层面的缓解方法。

Result: 研究发现：（1）检索通常能提高可回答查询的答案准确性，但会损害对不可回答查询的弃权能力；（2）过度搜索在复杂推理模型和深度研究系统中更为严重，噪声检索会加剧此现象，且在多轮对话中会累积；（3）检索证据的组成很重要，负面证据的存在能改善弃权性能。

Conclusion: 过度搜索是检索增强LLMs的关键效率限制，需要系统性识别和缓解。提出的TPC指标能有效量化性能-成本权衡，发布的OverSearchQA数据集将促进高效检索增强LLMs的持续研究。缓解策略应在查询和检索层面共同实施。

Abstract: Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) excel at knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating external retrieval. However, they often over-search -- unnecessarily invoking search tool even when it does not improve response quality, which leads to computational inefficiency and hallucinations by incorporating irrelevant context. In this work, we conduct a systematic evaluation of over-searching across multiple dimensions, including query types, model categories, retrieval conditions, and multi-turn conversations. Our finding shows: (i) search generally improves answer accuracy on answerable queries but harms abstention on unanswerable ones; (ii) over-searching is more pronounced in complex reasoning models and deep research systems, is exacerbated by noisy retrieval, and compounds across turns in multi-turn conversations; and (iii) the composition of retrieved evidence is crucial, as the presence of negative evidence improves abstention. To quantify over-searching, we introduce Tokens Per Correctness (TPC), an evaluation metric that captures the performance-cost trade-off for search-augmented LLMs. Lastly, we investigate mitigation approaches at both the query and retrieval levels and release the OverSearchQA to foster continued research into efficient search-augmented LLMs.

Abstract: The development of a cross-city accident prevention system is particularly challenging due to the heterogeneity, inconsistent reporting, and inherently clustered, sparse, cyclical, and noisy nature of urban accident data. These intrinsic data properties, combined with fragmented governance and incompatible reporting standards, have long hindered the creation of an integrated, cross-city accident prevention framework. To address this gap, we propose the Mamba Local-ttention Spatial-Temporal Network MLA-STNet, a unified system that formulates accident risk prediction as a multi-task learning problem across multiple cities. MLA-STNet integrates two complementary modules: (i)the Spatio-Temporal Geographical Mamba-Attention (STG-MA), which suppresses unstable spatio-temporal fluctuations and strengthens long-range temporal dependencies; and (ii) the Spatio-Temporal Semantic Mamba-Attention (STS-MA), which mitigates cross-city heterogeneity through a shared-parameter design that jointly trains all cities while preserving individual semantic representation spaces. We validate the proposed framework through 75 experiments under two forecasting scenarios, full-day and high-frequency accident periods, using real-world datasets from New York City and Chicago. Compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, MLA-STNet achieves up to 6% lower RMSE, 8% higher Recall, and 5% higher MAP, while maintaining less than 1% performance variation under 50% input noise. These results demonstrate that MLA-STNet effectively unifies heterogeneous urban datasets within a scalable, robust, and interpretable Cross-City Accident Prevention System, paving the way for coordinated and data-driven urban safety management.

Result: 在公开数据集上的计算实验表明，与基于正则化和逐步回归的基准方法相比，MILO方法构建的评分系统具有更优的AUC值

Conclusion: 该研究推动了基于混合整数优化技术构建高可解释性分类模型的发展

Abstract: A scoring system is a linear classifier composed of a small number of explanatory variables, each assigned a small integer coefficient. This system is highly interpretable and allows predictions to be made with simple manual calculations without the need for a calculator. Several previous studies have used mixed-integer optimization (MIO) techniques to develop scoring systems for binary classification; however, they have not focused on directly maximizing AUC (i.e., area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), even though AUC is recognized as an essential evaluation metric for scoring systems. Our goal herein is to establish an effective MIO framework for constructing scoring systems that directly maximize the buffered AUC (bAUC) as the tightest concave lower bound on AUC. Our optimization model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear optimization (MILO) problem that maximizes bAUC subject to a group sparsity constraint for limiting the number of questions in the scoring system. Computational experiments using publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that our MILO method can build scoring systems with superior AUC values compared to the baseline methods based on regularization and stepwise regression. This research contributes to the advancement of MIO techniques for developing highly interpretable classification models.

Abstract: The Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme provides a stable variational framework for computing Wasserstein gradient flows, but its practical use is often limited by the high computational cost of repeatedly solving the JKO subproblems. We propose a self-supervised approach for learning a JKO solution operator without requiring numerical solutions of any JKO trajectories. The learned operator maps an input density directly to the minimizer of the corresponding JKO subproblem, and can be iteratively applied to efficiently generate the gradient-flow evolution. A key challenge is that only a number of initial densities are typically available for training. To address this, we introduce a Learn-to-Evolve algorithm that jointly learns the JKO operator and its induced trajectories by alternating between trajectory generation and operator updates. As training progresses, the generated data increasingly approximates true JKO trajectories. Meanwhile, this Learn-to-Evolve strategy serves as a natural form of data augmentation, significantly enhancing the generalization ability of the learned operator. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy, stability, and robustness of the proposed method across various choices of energies and initial conditions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce Parallel Coordinated Reasoning (PaCoRe), a training-and-inference framework designed to overcome a central limitation of contemporary language models: their inability to scale test-time compute (TTC) far beyond sequential reasoning under a fixed context window. PaCoRe departs from the traditional sequential paradigm by driving TTC through massive parallel exploration coordinated via a message-passing architecture in multiple rounds. Each round launches many parallel reasoning trajectories, compacts their findings into context-bounded messages, and synthesizes these messages to guide the next round and ultimately produce the final answer. Trained end-to-end with large-scale, outcome-based reinforcement learning, the model masters the synthesis abilities required by PaCoRe and scales to multi-million-token effective TTC without exceeding context limits. The approach yields strong improvements across diverse domains, and notably pushes reasoning beyond frontier systems in mathematics: an 8B model reaches 94.5% on HMMT 2025, surpassing GPT-5's 93.2% by scaling effective TTC to roughly two million tokens. We open-source model checkpoints, training data, and the full inference pipeline to accelerate follow-up work.

Abstract: Conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimation is the de facto gold standard for targeting a treatment to a heterogeneous population. The method estimates treatment effects up to an error $ε> 0$ in each of $M$ different strata of the population, targeting individuals in decreasing order of estimated treatment effect until the budget runs out. In general, this method requires $O(M/ε^2)$ samples. This is best possible if the goal is to estimate all treatment effects up to an $ε$ error. In this work, we show how to achieve the same total treatment effect as CATE with only $O(M/ε)$ samples for natural distributions of treatment effects. The key insight is that coarse estimates suffice for near-optimal treatment allocations. In addition, we show that budget flexibility can further reduce the sample complexity of allocation. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on various real-world RCT datasets. In all cases, it finds nearly optimal treatment allocations with surprisingly few samples. Our work highlights the fundamental distinction between treatment effect estimation and treatment allocation: the latter requires far fewer samples.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) offers a promising framework for optimizing large language models in reasoning tasks. However, existing RLVR algorithms focus on different granularities, and each has complementary strengths and limitations. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) updates the policy with token-level importance ratios, which preserves fine-grained credit assignment but often suffers from high variance and instability. In contrast, Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) applies single sequence-level importance ratios across all tokens in a response that better matches sequence-level rewards, but sacrifices token-wise credit assignment. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Hybrid Policy Optimization (DHPO) to bridge GRPO and GSPO within a single clipped surrogate objective. DHPO combines token-level and sequence-level importance ratios using weighting mechanisms. We explore two variants of the mixing mechanism, including an averaged mixing and an entropy-guided mixing. To further stabilize training, we employ a branch-specific clipping strategy that constrains token-level and sequence-level ratios within separate trust regions before mixing, preventing outliers in either branch from dominating the update. Across seven challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, experiments on both dense and MoE models from the Qwen3 series show that DHPO consistently outperforms GRPO and GSPO. We will release our code upon acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: Time series are highly valuable and rarely shareable across nodes, making federated learning a promising paradigm to leverage distributed temporal data. However, different sampling standards lead to diverse time granularities and variable sets across nodes, hindering classical federated learning. We propose PiXTime, a novel time series forecasting model designed for federated learning that enables effective prediction across nodes with multi-granularity and heterogeneous variable sets. PiXTime employs a personalized Patch Embedding to map node-specific granularity time series into token sequences of a unified dimension for processing by a subsequent shared model, and uses a global VE Table to align variable category semantics across nodes, thereby enhancing cross-node transferability. With a transformer-based shared model, PiXTime captures representations of auxiliary series with arbitrary numbers of variables and uses cross-attention to enhance the prediction of the target series. Experiments show PiXTime achieves state-of-the-art performance in federated settings and demonstrates superior performance on eight widely used real-world traditional benchmarks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We reveal that transformers trained in an autoregressive manner naturally encode time-delayed causal structures in their learned representations. When predicting future values in multivariate time series, the gradient sensitivities of transformer outputs with respect to past inputs directly recover the underlying causal graph, without any explicit causal objectives or structural constraints. We prove this connection theoretically under standard identifiability conditions and develop a practical extraction method using aggregated gradient attributions. On challenging cases such as nonlinear dynamics, long-term dependencies, and non-stationary systems, this approach greatly surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art discovery algorithms, especially as data heterogeneity increases, exhibiting scaling potential where causal accuracy improves with data volume and heterogeneity, a property traditional methods lack. This unifying view lays the groundwork for a future paradigm where causal discovery operates through the lens of foundation models, and foundation models gain interpretability and enhancement through the lens of causality.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于聚类的Wi-Fi指纹室内定位方法，通过数据结构化提升定位精度，但以降低楼层检测准确率为代价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Wi-Fi指纹定位面临三大挑战：1) 指纹数据集规模有限且异构性强；2) 接收信号强度指示器(RSSI)波动大；3) 大型多楼层环境中定位模糊度高。这些因素导致全局模型定位精度下降，需要更精细的数据处理策略。

Method: 研究提出两阶段聚类方法：1. 预处理阶段：根据空间或无线电特征对指纹进行聚类（可在建筑或楼层级别进行）；2. 定位阶段：采用基于最强接入点的聚类估计算法，将新指纹分配到最相关聚类，然后在选定聚类内执行定位，使学习模型仅在更小且更一致的数据子集上操作。

Result: 在三个公共数据集和多种机器学习模型上的实验表明：1. 建筑级聚类策略能持续降低定位误差；2. 该方法提高了定位的稳定性；3. 但会导致楼层检测准确率下降，这是主要权衡点。

Conclusion: 通过聚类显式构建数据结构是一种有效且灵活的室内定位方法，特别适用于大规模场景，但在实际部署时需要权衡定位精度与楼层检测性能。

Abstract: Wi-Fi fingerprinting remains one of the most practical solutions for indoor positioning, however, its performance is often limited by the size and heterogeneity of fingerprint datasets, strong Received Signal Strength Indicator variability, and the ambiguity introduced in large and multi-floor environments. These factors significantly degrade localisation accuracy, particularly when global models are applied without considering structural constraints. This paper introduces a clustering-based method that structures the fingerprint dataset prior to localisation. Fingerprints are grouped using either spatial or radio features, and clustering can be applied at the building or floor level. In the localisation phase, a clustering estimation procedure based on the strongest access points assigns unseen fingerprints to the most relevant cluster. Localisation is then performed only within the selected clusters, allowing learning models to operate on reduced and more coherent subsets of data. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated on three public datasets and several machine learning models. Results show a consistent reduction in localisation errors, particularly under building-level strategies, but at the cost of reducing the floor detection accuracy. These results demonstrate that explicitly structuring datasets through clustering is an effective and flexible approach for scalable indoor positioning.

Abstract: We investigate whether sparse autoencoders (SAEs) identify genuine reasoning features in large language models (LLMs). Starting from features selected using standard contrastive activation methods, we introduce a falsification-oriented framework that combines causal token injection experiments and LLM-guided falsification to test whether feature activation reflects reasoning processes or superficial linguistic correlates. Across 20 configurations spanning multiple model families, layers, and reasoning datasets, we find that identified reasoning features are highly sensitive to token-level interventions. Injecting a small number of feature-associated tokens into non-reasoning text is sufficient to elicit strong activation for 59% to 94% of features, indicating reliance on lexical artifacts. For the remaining features that are not explained by simple token triggers, LLM-guided falsification consistently produces non-reasoning inputs that activate the feature and reasoning inputs that do not, with no analyzed feature satisfying our criteria for genuine reasoning behavior. Steering these features yields minimal changes or slight degradations in benchmark performance. Together, these results suggest that SAE features identified by contrastive approaches primarily capture linguistic correlates of reasoning rather than the underlying reasoning computations themselves.

Abstract: Transformer-based autoregressive models excel in data generation but are inherently constrained by their reliance on discretized tokens, which limits their ability to represent continuous values with high precision. We analyze the scalability limitations of existing discretization-based approaches for generating hybrid discrete-continuous sequences, particularly in high-precision domains such as semiconductor circuit designs, where precision loss can lead to functional failure. To address the challenge, we propose AGDC, a novel unified framework that jointly models discrete and continuous values for variable-length sequences. AGDC employs a hybrid approach that combines categorical prediction for discrete values with diffusion-based modeling for continuous values, incorporating two key technical components: an end-of-sequence (EOS) logit adjustment mechanism that uses an MLP to dynamically adjust EOS token logits based on sequence context, and a length regularization term integrated into the loss function. Additionally, we present ContLayNet, a large-scale benchmark comprising 334K high-precision semiconductor layout samples with specialized evaluation metrics that capture functional correctness where precision errors significantly impact performance. Experiments on semiconductor layouts (ContLayNet), graphic layouts, and SVGs demonstrate AGDC's superior performance in generating high-fidelity hybrid vector representations compared to discretization-based and fixed-schema baselines, achieving scalable high-precision generation across diverse domains.

Abstract: Traditional post-training quantization (PTQ) is considered an effective approach to reduce model size and accelerate inference of large-scale language models (LLMs). However, existing low-rank PTQ methods require costly fine-tuning to determine a compromise rank for diverse data and layers in large models, failing to exploit their full potential. Additionally, the current SVD-based low-rank approximation compounds the computational overhead. In this work, we thoroughly analyze the varying effectiveness of low-rank approximation across different layers in representative models. Accordingly, we introduce \underline{F}lexible \underline{L}ow-\underline{R}ank \underline{Q}uantization (FLRQ), a novel solution designed to quickly identify the accuracy-optimal ranks and aggregate them to achieve minimal storage combinations. FLRQ comprises two powerful components, Rank1-Sketch-based Flexible Rank Selection (R1-FLR) and Best Low-rank Approximation under Clipping (BLC). R1-FLR applies the R1-Sketch with Gaussian projection for the fast low-rank approximation, enabling outlier-aware rank extraction for each layer. Meanwhile, BLC aims at minimizing the low-rank quantization error under the scaling and clipping strategy through an iterative method. FLRQ demonstrates strong effectiveness and robustness in comprehensive experiments, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both quantization quality and algorithm efficiency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Hyper-Connections (HC) generalizes residual connections by introducing dynamic residual matrices that mix information across multiple residual streams, accelerating convergence in deep neural networks. However, unconstrained residual matrices can compromise training stability. To address this, DeepSeek's Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) approximately projects these matrices onto the Birkhoff polytope via iterative Sinkhorn--Knopp (SK) normalization. We identify two limitations of this approach: (i) finite SK iterations do not guarantee exact doubly stochasticity, leaving an approximation gap that can accumulate through network depth and undermine stability; (ii) efficient SK implementation requires highly specialized CUDA kernels, raising engineering barriers and reducing portability. Motivated by the Birkhoff--von Neumann theorem, we propose mHC-lite, a simple reparameterization that explicitly constructs doubly stochastic matrices as convex combinations of permutation matrices. This approach guarantees exact doubly stochasticity by construction and can be implemented using only native matrix operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that mHC-lite matches or exceeds mHC in performance while achieving higher training throughput with a naive implementation and eliminating the residual instabilities observed in both HC and mHC. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/FFTYYY/mhc-lite.

Abstract: The SmoothLLM defense provides a certification guarantee against jailbreaking attacks, but it relies on a strict `k-unstable' assumption that rarely holds in practice. This strong assumption can limit the trustworthiness of the provided safety certificate. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a more realistic probabilistic framework, `(k, $\varepsilon$)-unstable,' to certify defenses against diverse jailbreaking attacks, from gradient-based (GCG) to semantic (PAIR). We derive a new, data-informed lower bound on SmoothLLM's defense probability by incorporating empirical models of attack success, providing a more trustworthy and practical safety certificate. By introducing the notion of (k, $\varepsilon$)-unstable, our framework provides practitioners with actionable safety guarantees, enabling them to set certification thresholds that better reflect the real-world behavior of LLMs. Ultimately, this work contributes a practical and theoretically-grounded mechanism to make LLMs more resistant to the exploitation of their safety alignments, a critical challenge in secure AI deployment.

Abstract: Accurate P-wave detection is critical for earthquake early warning, yet strong-motion records pose challenges due to high noise levels, limited labeled data, and complex waveform characteristics. This study reframes P-wave arrival detection as a self-supervised anomaly detection task to evaluate how architectural variations regulate the trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and anomaly discrimination. Through a comprehensive grid search of 492 Variational Autoencoder configurations, we show that while skip connections minimize reconstruction error (Mean Absolute Error approximately 0.0012), they induce "overgeneralization", allowing the model to reconstruct noise and masking the detection signal. In contrast, attention mechanisms prioritize global context over local detail and yield the highest detection performance with an area-under-the-curve of 0.875. The attention-based Variational Autoencoder achieves an area-under-the-curve of 0.91 in the 0 to 40-kilometer near-source range, demonstrating high suitability for immediate early warning applications. These findings establish that architectural constraints favoring global context over pixel-perfect reconstruction are essential for robust, self-supervised P-wave detection.

Abstract: Multi-turn conversational attacks, which leverage psychological principles like Foot-in-the-Door (FITD), where a small initial request paves the way for a more significant one, to bypass safety alignments, pose a persistent threat to Large Language Models (LLMs). Progress in defending against these attacks is hindered by a reliance on manual, hard-to-scale dataset creation. This paper introduces a novel, automated pipeline for generating large-scale, psychologically-grounded multi-turn jailbreak datasets. We systematically operationalize FITD techniques into reproducible templates, creating a benchmark of 1,500 scenarios across illegal activities and offensive content. We evaluate seven models from three major LLM families under both multi-turn (with history) and single-turn (without history) conditions. Our results reveal stark differences in contextual robustness: models in the GPT family demonstrate a significant vulnerability to conversational history, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) increasing by as much as 32 percentage points. In contrast, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash exhibits exceptional resilience, proving nearly immune to these attacks, while Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku shows strong but imperfect resistance. These findings highlight a critical divergence in how current safety architectures handle conversational context and underscore the need for defenses that can resist narrative-based manipulation.

Abstract: Algorithm extraction aims to synthesize executable programs directly from models trained on specific algorithmic tasks, enabling de novo algorithm discovery without relying on human-written code. However, extending this paradigm to Transformer is hindered by superposition, where entangled features encoded in overlapping directions obstruct the extraction of symbolic expressions. In this work, we propose the Discrete Transformer, an architecture explicitly engineered to bridge the gap between continuous representations and discrete symbolic logic. By enforcing a strict functional disentanglement, which constrains Numerical Attention to information routing and Numerical MLP to element-wise arithmetic, and employing temperature-annealed sampling, our method effectively facilitates the extraction of human-readable programs. Empirically, the Discrete Transformer not only achieves performance comparable to RNN-based baselines but crucially extends interpretability to continuous variable domains. Moreover, our analysis of the annealing process shows that the efficient discrete search undergoes a clear phase transition from exploration to exploitation. We further demonstrate that our method enables fine-grained control over synthesized programs by imposing inductive biases. Collectively, these findings establish the Discrete Transformer as a robust framework for demonstration-free algorithm discovery, offering a rigorous pathway toward Transformer interpretability.

Abstract: Tiny Recursive Models (TRM) were proposed as a parameter-efficient alternative to large language models for solving Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) style tasks. The original work reports strong performance and suggests that recursive latent updates enable non-trivial reasoning, but it remains unclear how much of this performance stems from architecture, test-time compute, or task-specific priors. In this technical note, we empirically analyze the ARC Prize TRM checkpoint on ARC-AGI-1 and report four behavioral findings and an efficiency comparison. First, we show that test-time augmentation and majority-vote ensembling account for a substantial fraction of reported performance: the 1000-sample voting pipeline improves Pass@1 by about 11 percentage points over single-pass canonical inference. Second, a puzzle-identity ablation reveals strict dependence on task identifiers: replacing the correct puzzle ID with a blank or random token yields zero accuracy. Third, a recursion trajectory analysis shows that most of the final accuracy is achieved at the first recursion step and that performance saturates after few latent updates, indicating shallow effective recursion. Fourth, early-stage training experiments under canonical versus heavy augmentation regimes suggest that heavy augmentation broadens the distribution of candidate solutions and improves multi-sample success. Finally, we compare TRM with a naive QLoRA fine-tune of Llama 3 8B on canonical ARC-AGI-1, finding that TRM's non-autoregressive design achieves much higher throughput and substantially lower memory usage in this setting. Overall, TRM's ARC-AGI-1 performance appears to arise from an interaction between efficiency, task-specific conditioning, and aggressive test-time compute rather than deep internal reasoning.

Abstract: Accurate drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is essential for computational drug discovery, yet existing models often rely on single-modality predefined molecular descriptors or sequence-based embeddings with limited representativeness. We propose Tensor-DTI, a contrastive learning framework that integrates multimodal embeddings from molecular graphs, protein language models, and binding-site predictions to improve interaction modeling. Tensor-DTI employs a siamese dual-encoder architecture, enabling it to capture both chemical and structural interaction features while distinguishing interacting from non-interacting pairs. Evaluations on multiple DTI benchmarks demonstrate that Tensor-DTI outperforms existing sequence-based and graph-based models. We also conduct large-scale inference experiments on CDK2 across billion-scale chemical libraries, where Tensor-DTI produces chemically plausible hit distributions even when CDK2 is withheld from training. In enrichment studies against Glide docking and Boltz-2 co-folder, Tensor-DTI remains competitive on CDK2 and improves the screening budget required to recover moderate fractions of high-affinity ligands on out-of-family targets under strict family-holdout splits. Additionally, we explore its applicability to protein-RNA and peptide-protein interactions. Our findings highlight the benefits of integrating multimodal information with contrastive objectives to enhance interaction-prediction accuracy and to provide more interpretable and reliability-aware models for virtual screening.

Conclusion: 位置编码融合方式是长序列Transformer中一个重要的设计选择，应作为明确的建模决策而非固定默认选项。

Abstract: Transformers require positional encodings to represent sequence order, yet most prior work focuses on designing new positional encodings rather than examining how positional information is fused with token embeddings. In this paper, we study whether the fusion mechanism itself affects performance, particularly in long-sequence settings. We conduct a controlled empirical study comparing three canonical fusion strategies--element-wise addition, concatenation with projection, and scalar gated fusion--under identical Transformer architectures, data splits, and random seeds. Experiments on three text classification datasets spanning short (AG News), medium (IMDB), and long (ArXiv) sequences show that fusion choice has negligible impact on short texts but produces consistent gains on long documents. To verify that these gains are structural rather than stochastic, we perform paired-seed analysis and cross-dataset comparison across sequence-length regimes. Additional experiments on the ArXiv dataset indicate that the benefit of learnable fusion generalizes across multiple positional encoding families. Finally, we explore a lightweight convolutional gating mechanism that introduces local inductive bias at the fusion level, evaluated on long documents only. Our results indicate that positional-encoding fusion is a non-trivial design choice for long-sequence Transformers and should be treated as an explicit modeling decision rather than a fixed default.

Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in representation learning approaches that uncover the latent structure of high-dimensional data, this work proposes new algorithms for reconstruction-based manifold learning within Reproducing-Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). Each observation is first reconstructed as a linear combination of the other samples in the RKHS, by optimizing a vector form of the Representer Theorem for their autorepresentation property. A separable operator-valued kernel extends the formulation to vector-valued data while retaining the simplicity of a single scalar similarity function. A subsequent kernel-alignment task projects the data into a lower-dimensional latent space whose Gram matrix aims to match the high-dimensional reconstruction kernel, thus transferring the auto-reconstruction geometry of the RKHS to the embedding. Therefore, the proposed algorithms represent an extended approach to the autorepresentation property, exhibited by many natural data, by using and adapting well-known results of Kernel Learning Theory. Numerical experiments on both simulated (concentric circles and swiss-roll) and real (cancer molecular activity and IoT network intrusions) datasets provide empirical evidence of the practical effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and behavioral patterns. Eye movement data offers a non-invasive diagnostic tool for ASD detection, as it is inherently discrete and exhibits short-term temporal dependencies, reflecting localized gaze focus between fixation points. These characteristics enable the data to provide deeper insights into subtle behavioral markers, distinguishing ASD-related patterns from typical development. Eye movement signals mainly contain short-term and localized dependencies. However, despite the widespread application of stacked attention layers in Transformer-based models for capturing long-range dependencies, our experimental results indicate that this approach yields only limited benefits when applied to eye movement data. This may be because discrete fixation points and short-term dependencies in gaze focus reduce the utility of global attention mechanisms, making them less efficient than architectures focusing on local temporal patterns. To efficiently capture subtle and complex eye movement patterns, distinguishing ASD from typically developing (TD) individuals, a discrete short-term sequential (DSTS) modeling framework is designed with Class-aware Representation and Imbalance-aware Mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on several eye movement datasets, DSTS outperforms both traditional machine learning techniques and more sophisticated deep learning models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Poisson non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a widely used method to find interpretable "parts-based" decompositions of count data. While many variants of Poisson NMF exist, existing methods assume that the "parts" in the decomposition combine additively. This assumption may be natural in some settings, but not in others. Here we introduce Poisson NMF with the shifted-log link function to relax this assumption. The shifted-log link function has a single tuning parameter, and as this parameter varies the model changes from assuming that parts combine additively (i.e., standard Poisson NMF) to assuming that parts combine more multiplicatively. We provide an algorithm to fit this model by maximum likelihood, and also an approximation that substantially reduces computation time for large, sparse datasets (computations scale with the number of non-zero entries in the data matrix). We illustrate these new methods on a variety of real datasets. Our examples show how the choice of link function in Poisson NMF can substantively impact the results, and how in some settings the use of a shifted-log link function may improve interpretability compared with the standard, additive link.

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning have been hindered by a persistent challenge: exploration collapse. The semantic homogeneity of random rollouts often traps models in narrow, over-optimized behaviors. While existing methods leverage policy entropy to encourage exploration, they face inherent limitations. Global entropy regularization is susceptible to reward hacking, which can induce meaningless verbosity, whereas local token-selective updates struggle with the strong inductive bias of pre-trained models. To address this, we propose Latent Policy Optimization via Iterative Information Bottleneck (IIB-LPO), a novel approach that shifts exploration from statistical perturbation of token distributions to topological branching of reasoning trajectories. IIB-LPO triggers latent branching at high-entropy states to diversify reasoning paths and employs the Information Bottleneck principle both as a trajectory filter and a self-reward mechanism, ensuring concise and informative exploration. Empirical results across four mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that IIB-LPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior methods by margins of up to 5.3% in accuracy and 7.4% in diversity metrics.

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly embedded in societal infrastructure, auditing them for bias is of growing importance. However, in real-world deployments, auditing is complicated by the fact that model owners may adaptively update their models in response to changing environments, such as financial markets. These updates can alter the underlying model class while preserving certain properties of interest, raising fundamental questions about what can be reliably audited under such shifts.
  In this work, we study group fairness auditing under arbitrary updates. We consider general shifts that modify the pre-audit model class while maintaining invariance of the audited property. Our goals are two-fold: (i) to characterize the information complexity of allowable updates, by identifying which strategic changes preserve the property under audit; and (ii) to efficiently estimate auditing properties, such as group fairness, using a minimal number of labeled samples.
  We propose a generic framework for PAC auditing based on an Empirical Property Optimization (EPO) oracle. For statistical parity, we establish distribution-free auditing bounds characterized by the SP dimension, a novel combinatorial measure that captures the complexity of admissible strategic updates. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework naturally extends to other auditing objectives, including prediction error and robust risk.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation involves transferring the predictive capabilities of large, high-performing AI models (teachers) to smaller models (students) that can operate in environments with limited computing power. In this paper, we address the scenario in which only a few classes and their associated intermediate concepts are relevant to distill. This scenario is common in practice, yet few existing distillation methods explicitly focus on the relevant subtask. To address this gap, we introduce 'SubDistill', a new distillation algorithm with improved numerical properties that only distills the relevant components of the teacher model at each layer. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet with Convolutional and Transformer models demonstrate that SubDistill outperforms existing layer-wise distillation techniques on a representative set of subtasks. Our benchmark evaluations are complemented by Explainable AI analyses showing that our distilled student models more closely match the decision structure of the original teacher model.

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a persistent challenge in forecasting research and practice, particularly in business and financial analytics where forecasts inform high-stakes decisions. Traditional forecasting methods, while theoretically interpretable, often require extensive manual tuning and are difficult to replicate in proprietary environments. Machine learning approaches offer predictive flexibility but introduce challenges related to interpretability, stochastic training procedures, and cross-environment reproducibility. This paper examines Prophet, an open-source forecasting framework developed by Meta, as a reproducibility-enabling solution that balances interpretability, standardized workflows, and accessibility. Rather than proposing a new algorithm, this study evaluates how Prophet's additive structure, open-source implementation, and standardized workflow contribute to transparent and replicable forecasting practice. Using publicly available financial and retail datasets, we compare Prophet's performance and interpretability with multiple ARIMA specifications (auto-selected, manually specified, and seasonal variants) and Random Forest under a controlled and fully documented experimental design. This multi-model comparison provides a robust assessment of Prophet's relative performance and reproducibility advantages. Through concrete Python examples, we demonstrate how Prophet facilitates efficient forecasting workflows and integration with analytical pipelines. The study positions Prophet within the broader context of reproducible research. It highlights Prophet's role as a methodological building block that supports verification, auditability, and methodological rigor. This work provides researchers and practitioners with a practical reference framework for reproducible forecasting in Python-based research workflows.

Abstract: The constrained combinatorial multi-armed bandit model has been widely employed to solve problems in wireless networking and related areas, including the problem of wireless scheduling for throughput optimization under unknown channel conditions. Most work in this area uses an algorithm design strategy that combines a bandit learning algorithm with the virtual queue technique to track the throughput constraint violation. These algorithms seek to minimize the virtual queue length in their algorithm design. However, in networks where channel conditions change abruptly, the resulting constraints may become infeasible, leading to unbounded growth in virtual queue lengths. In this paper, we make the key observation that the dynamics of the head-of-line age, i.e. the age of the oldest packet in the virtual queue, make it more robust when used in algorithm design compared to the virtual queue length. We therefore design a learning-based scheduling policy that uses the head-of-line age in place of the virtual queue length. We show that our policy matches state-of-the-art performance under i.i.d. network conditions. Crucially, we also show that the system remains stable even under abrupt changes in channel conditions and can rapidly recover from periods of constraint infeasibility.

Abstract: The rapid deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to large-scale sensor networks that monitor environmental and urban phenomena in real time. Communities of Interest (CoIs) provide a promising paradigm for organising heterogeneous IoT sensor networks by grouping devices with similar operational and environmental characteristics. This work presents an anomaly detection framework based on the CoI paradigm by grouping sensors into communities using a fused similarity matrix that incorporates temporal correlations via Spearman coefficients, spatial proximity using Gaussian distance decay, and elevation similarities. For each community, representative stations based on the best silhouette are selected and three autoencoder architectures (BiLSTM, LSTM, and MLP) are trained using Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with expanding window cross-validation and tested on stations from the same cluster and the best representative stations of other clusters. The models are trained on normal temperature patterns of the data and anomalies are detected through reconstruction error analysis. Experimental results show a robust within-community performance across the evaluated configurations, while variations across communities are observed. Overall, the results support the applicability of community-based model sharing in reducing computational overhead and to analyse model generalisability across IoT sensor networks.

Abstract: Automated seizure detection from electroencephalography (EEG) remains difficult due to the large variability of seizure dynamics across patients, recording conditions, and clinical settings. We introduce LookAroundNet, a transformer-based seizure detector that uses a wider temporal window of EEG data to model seizure activity. The seizure detector incorporates EEG signals before and after the segment of interest, reflecting how clinicians use surrounding context when interpreting EEG recordings. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple EEG datasets spanning diverse clinical environments, patient populations, and recording modalities, including routine clinical EEG and long-term ambulatory recordings, in order to study performance across varying data distributions. The evaluation includes publicly available datasets as well as a large proprietary collection of home EEG recordings, providing complementary views of controlled clinical data and unconstrained home-monitoring conditions. Our results show that LookAroundNet achieves strong performance across datasets, generalizes well to previously unseen recording conditions, and operates with computational costs compatible with real-world clinical deployment. The results indicate that extended temporal context, increased training data diversity, and model ensembling are key factors for improving performance. This work contributes to moving automatic seizure detection models toward clinically viable solutions.

Abstract: Distributed AI systems face critical memory management challenges across computation, communication, and deployment layers. RRAM based in memory computing suffers from scalability limitations due to device non idealities and fixed array sizes. Decentralized AI frameworks struggle with memory efficiency across NAT constrained networks due to static routing that ignores computational load. Multi agent deployment systems tightly couple application logic with execution environments, preventing adaptive memory optimization. These challenges stem from a fundamental lack of coordinated memory management across architectural layers. We introduce Self Evolving Distributed Memory Architecture for Scalable AI Systems, a three layer framework that unifies memory management across computation, communication, and deployment. Our approach features (1) memory guided matrix processing with dynamic partitioning based on device characteristics, (2) memory aware peer selection considering network topology and computational capacity, and (3) runtime adaptive deployment optimization through continuous reconfiguration. The framework maintains dual memory systems tracking both long term performance patterns and short term workload statistics. Experiments on COCO 2017, ImageNet, and SQuAD show that our method achieves 87.3 percent memory utilization efficiency and 142.5 operations per second compared to Ray Distributed at 72.1 percent and 98.7 operations per second, while reducing communication latency by 30.2 percent to 171.2 milliseconds and improving resource utilization to 82.7 percent. Our contributions include coordinated memory management across three architectural layers, workload adaptive resource allocation, and a dual memory architecture enabling dynamic system optimization.

Abstract: Federated Domain Generalization (FDG) aims to collaboratively train a global model across distributed clients that can generalize well on unseen domains. However, existing FDG methods typically struggle with cross-client data heterogeneity and incur significant communication and computation overhead. To address these challenges, this paper presents a new FDG framework, dubbed FaST-PT, which facilitates local feature augmentation and efficient unseen domain adaptation in a distributed manner. First, we propose a lightweight Multi-Modal Style Transfer (MST) method to transform image embedding under text supervision, which could expand the training data distribution and mitigate domain shift. We then design a dual-prompt module that decomposes the prompt into global and domain prompts. Specifically, global prompts capture general knowledge from augmented embedding across clients, while domain prompts capture domain-specific knowledge from local data. Besides, Domain-aware Prompt Generation (DPG) is introduced to adaptively generate suitable prompts for each sample, which facilitates unseen domain adaptation through knowledge fusion. Extensive experiments on four cross-domain benchmark datasets, e.g., PACS and DomainNet, demonstrate the superior performance of FaST-PT over SOTA FDG methods such as FedDG-GA and DiPrompt. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and efficiency of FaST-PT.
