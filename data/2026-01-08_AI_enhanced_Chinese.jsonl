However, due to insufficient collaborative and perceptual capabilities, existing methods are inadequate for scaling across diverse environmental conditions. To address these challenges, we propose PC2P, a novel distributed MAPF method derived from a Q-learning-based MARL framework. Initially, we introduce a personalized-enhanced communication mechanism based on dynamic graph topology, which ascertains the core aspects of ``who\" and ``what\" in interactive process through three-stage operations: selection, generation, and aggregation. Concurrently, we incorporate local crowd perception to enrich agents' heuristic observation, thereby strengthening the model's guidance for effective actions via the integration of static spatial constraints and dynamic occupancy changes. To resolve extreme deadlock issues, we propose a region-based deadlock-breaking strategy that leverages expert guidance to implement efficient coordination within confined areas. Experimental results demonstrate that PC2P achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art distributed MAPF methods in varied environments. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module for overall performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Three real-world case studies are tested in controlled, containerised pilots in telecommunications security, national heritage asset management, and utilities customer service automation. Initial empirical results show that, for these case studies, prototypes were delivered within two weeks and pilot-ready solutions within one month, suggesting reduced development overhead compared to conventional approaches and improved user accessibility. However, findings also reinforce limitations documented in the literature, including variability in LLM behaviour that leads to challenges in transitioning from prototype to production maturity. We conclude by outlining critical research directions for improving reliability, scalability, and governance in MAS architectures and the further work needed to mature MAS design patterns to mitigate the inherent challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, traditional human-dependent chromatographic process development faces challenges such as reliance on expert experience, long development cycles, and labor intensity. ChromR, a large language model (LLM)-driven platform for chromatographic process design and optimization, is presented in this work. The platform integrates ChromLLM, a domain-specific LLM trained for chromatography, along with a multi-agent system and an automated chromatographic experimental device. The multi-agent system comprises four agents: domain knowledge answering, experimental design, experimental execution, and data analysis. ChromR enables automatic completion of the entire workflow-including initial process parameter recommendation, experimental design, automated execution, data analysis, and multi-objective optimization. By utilizing ChromR, dependency on expert knowledge is effectively reduced, while labor input and development time are significantly decreased. Chromatographic purification of the extract of Ginkgo biloba leaf (EGBL) was selected as a case study. ChromR successfully developed a chromatographic process within one week that meets multiple objectives, including fraction quality and production efficiency, reducing development time to approximately one-seventh of that required by the conventional paradigm.

This paper presents a game-theoretic study of covert communication in LLM-driven multi-agent systems. We analyse interactions across four canonical game-theoretic settings under different communication regimes, including explicit, restricted, and absent communication.

Our analysis encompasses current industry adoption patterns across major hardware platforms (NVIDIA Jetson, Qualcomm Snapdragon, Apple Neural Engine, ARM architectures), deployment frameworks (TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, PyTorch Mobile, CoreML), and optimization strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that modern lightweight transformers can achieve 75-96% of full-model accuracy while reducing model size by 4-10x and inference latency by 3-9x, enabling deployment on devices with as little as 2-5W power consumption. We identify sparse attention mechanisms, mixed-precision quantization (INT8/FP16), and hardware-aware neural architecture search as the most effective optimization strategies. Novel findings include memory-bandwidth bottleneck analysis revealing 15-40M parameter models achieve optimal hardware utilization (60-75% efficiency), quantization sweet spots for different model types, and comprehensive energy efficiency profiling across edge platforms.

The Pneuma Project introduces Pneuma-Seeker, a system that helps users articulate and fulfill information needs through iterative interaction with a language model-powered platform. The system reifies the user's evolving information need as a relational data model and incrementally converges toward a usable document aligned with that intent. To achieve this, the system combines three architectural ideas: context specialization to reduce LLM burden across subtasks, a conductor-style planner to assemble dynamic execution plans, and a convergence mechanism based on shared state.

In pursuit of low latency, some recently proposed BFT consensus protocols employ a leaderless optimistic fast path, in which clients broadcast their requests directly to replicas without first serializing requests at a leader, resulting in an end-to-end commit latency of 2 message delays ($2\u0394$) during fault-free, synchronous periods. However, such a fast path only works if there is no contention: concurrent contending requests can cause replicas to diverge if they receive conflicting requests in different orders, triggering costly recovery procedures.\n  In this work, we present Aspen, a leaderless BFT protocol that achieves a near-optimal latency of $2\u0394+ \\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon$ indicates a short waiting delay. Aspen removes the no-contention condition by utilizing a best-effort sequencing layer based on loosely synchronized clocks and network delay estimates. Aspen requires $n = 3f + 2p + 1$ replicas to cope with up to $f$ Byzantine nodes. The $2p$ extra nodes allow Aspen's fast path to proceed even if up to $p$ replicas diverge due to unpredictable network delays. When its optimistic conditions do not hold, Aspen falls back to PBFT-style protocol, guaranteeing safety and liveness under partial synchrony. In experiments with wide-area distributed replicas, Aspen commits requests in less than 75 ms, a 1.2 to 3.3$\\times$ improvement compared to previous protocols, while supporting 19,000 requests per second.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our findings show that (i) lightweight, tool-mediated coordination enabled stable progress even during remote periods; (ii) one-week sprints and flexible ceremonies helped reconcile Scrum with academic obligations; and (iii) shared motivation, role clarity, and compatible working styles were as critical as process mechanics.

In multi-agent reinforcement learning, effective policy learning depends on how agents sense, interpret, and process inputs. Traditional approaches often rely on handcrafted feature extraction or raw vector-based representations, which limit the scalability and efficiency of learned policies concerning input order and size. In this work we propose an image-based reinforcement learning method for decentralized control of a multi-agent system, where observations are encoded as structured visual inputs that can be processed by Neural Networks, extracting its spatial features and producing novel decentralized motion control rules. We evaluate our approach on a multi-agent convergence task of agents with limited-range and bearing-only sensing that aim to keep the swarm cohesive during the aggregation. The algorithm's performance is evaluated against two benchmarks: an analytical solution proposed by Bellaiche and Bruckstein, which ensures convergence but progresses slowly, and VariAntNet, a neural network-based framework that converges much faster but shows medium success rates in hard constellations. Our method achieves high convergence, with a pace nearly matching that of VariAntNet.

However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called \"Red Queen\" dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives. Our work positions Core War as a rich, controllable sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation in artificial systems and for evaluating LLM-based evolution methods. More broadly, the simplicity and effectiveness of DRQ suggest that similarly minimal self-play approaches could prove useful in other more practical multi-agent adversarial domains, like real-world cybersecurity or combating drug resistance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While policy ratio clipping stabilizes training, this heuristic hard constraint incurs a fundamental cost: it indiscriminately truncates gradients from high-return yet high-divergence actions, suppressing rare but highly informative \"eureka moments\" in complex reasoning. Moreover, once data becomes slightly stale, hard clipping renders it unusable, leading to severe sample inefficiency. In this work, we revisit the trust-region objective in policy optimization and show that explicitly constraining the \\emph{variance (second central moment) of the policy ratio} provides a principled and smooth relaxation of hard clipping. This distributional constraint stabilizes policy updates while preserving gradient signals from valuable trajectories. Building on this insight, we propose $R^2VPO$ (Ratio-Variance Regularized Policy Optimization), a novel primal-dual framework that supports stable on-policy learning and enables principled off-policy data reuse by dynamically reweighting stale samples rather than discarding them.

However, deploying MoE models on such edge-based GPU-NDP systems faces three critical challenges: 1) severe load imbalance across NDP units due to non-uniform expert selection and expert parallelism, 2) insufficient GPU utilization during expert computation within NDP units, and 3) extensive data pre-profiling necessitated by unpredictable expert activation patterns for pre-fetching. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient inference framework featuring three key optimizations. First, the underexplored tensor parallelism in MoE inference is exploited to partition and compute large expert parameters across multiple NDP units simultaneously towards edge low-batch scenarios. Second, a load-balancing-aware scheduling algorithm distributes expert computations across NDP units and GPU to maximize resource utilization. Third, a dataset-free pre-fetching strategy proactively loads frequently accessed experts to minimize activation delays. Experimental results show that our framework enables GPU-NDP systems to achieve 2.41x on average and up to 2.56x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to state-of-the-art approaches, significantly enhancing MoE inference efficiency in resource-constrained environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To bridge this gap, our paper introduces an innovative, pedagogical benchmarking method that mirrors the evaluation processes encountered in academic programming courses. We introduce CodeEval, a multi-dimensional benchmark dataset designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs across 24 distinct aspects of Python programming. The dataset covers three proficiency levels - beginner, intermediate, and advanced - and includes both class-based and function-based problem types with detailed problem specifications and comprehensive test suites. To facilitate widespread adoption, we also developed RunCodeEval, an open-source execution framework that provides researchers with a ready-to-use evaluation pipeline for CodeEval. RunCodeEval handles test execution, context setup, and metrics generation, enabling researchers to quickly obtain detailed insights into model strengths and weaknesses across complexity levels, problem types, and programming categories.

The results demonstrate FREEDA's capability to autonomously reconfigure deployments by migrating services, adjusting flavour selections, or rebalancing workloads, successfully achieving an optimal balance among resilience, efficiency, and environmental impact.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86FREEDA\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4e91\u8fb9\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u4e0a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u6545\u969c\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u78b3\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u90e8\u7f72\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u4e91\u8fb9\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6545\u969c\u6062\u590d\u529b\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u73af\u4fdd\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6743\u8861\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u96be\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u5316\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FREEDA\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u8c03\u6574\u90e8\u7f72\u914d\u7f6e\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u64cd\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8d44\u6e90\u8017\u5c3d\u3001\u8282\u70b9\u6545\u969c\u548c\u78b3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6ce2\u52a8\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eFREEDA\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u670d\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\u3001\u89c4\u683c\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u91cd\u65b0\u5e73\u8861\u7b49\u81ea\u4e3b\u91cd\u65b0\u914d\u7f6e\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f39\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u95f4\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "FREEDA\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u4e91\u8fb9\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u4e0a\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6545\u969c\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u78b3\u6548\u7387\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce the first ordinal classification framework for forecasting wildfire severity levels directly aligned with operational decision-making in France. Our study investigates the influence of loss-function design on the ability of neural models to predict rare yet critical high-severity fire occurrences. We compare standard cross-entropy with several ordinal-aware objectives, including the proposed probabilistic TDeGPD loss derived from a truncated discrete exponentiated Generalized Pareto Distribution. Through extensive benchmarking over multiple architectures and real operational data, we show that ordinal supervision substantially improves model performance over conventional approaches. In particular, the Weighted Kappa Loss (WKLoss) achieves the best overall results, with more than +0.1 IoU gain on the most extreme severity classes while maintaining competitive calibration quality. However, performance remains limited for the rarest events due to their extremely low representation in the dataset. These findings highlight the importance of integrating both severity ordering, data imbalance considerations, and seasonality risk into wildfire forecasting systems. Future work will focus on incorporating seasonal dynamics and uncertainty information into training to further improve the reliability of extreme-event prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Here, we show that client heterogeneity destabilizes FL primarily by distorting local gradient dynamics during client-side optimization, causing systematic drift that accumulates across communication rounds and impedes global convergence. This observation highlights local gradients as a key regulatory lever for stabilizing heterogeneous FL systems. Building on this insight, we develop a general client-side perspective that regulates local gradient contributions without incurring additional communication overhead. Inspired by swarm intelligence, we instantiate this perspective through Exploratory--Convergent Gradient Re-aggregation (ECGR), which balances well-aligned and misaligned gradient components to preserve informative updates while suppressing destabilizing effects. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, including evaluations on the LC25000 medical imaging dataset, demonstrate that regulating local gradient dynamics consistently stabilizes federated learning across state-of-the-art methods under heterogeneous data distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u89c6\u89d2\u8c03\u63a7\u672c\u5730\u68af\u5ea6\u8d21\u732e\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u5f02\u6784\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff1a\u63d0\u51faECGR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u8861\u68af\u5ea6\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f02\u79fb", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u901a\u8fc7\u626d\u66f2\u672c\u5730\u68af\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f02\u79fb\u5e76\u963b\u788d\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7fa4\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u63a2\u7d22-\u6536\u655b\u68af\u5ea6\u91cd\u805a\u5408\uff08ECGR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u89c6\u89d2\u8c03\u63a7\u672c\u5730\u68af\u5ea6\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u5305\u62ecLC25000\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff09\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8c03\u63a7\u672c\u5730\u68af\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u5404\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5730\u68af\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u5f02\u6784\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8c03\u63a7\u6760\u6746\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ECGR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027"}}

This deployment bottleneck limits reproducibility, large-scale evaluation, and the practical integration of scientific tools into modern AI-for-Science (AI4S) and agentic workflows.\n  We present Deploy-Master, a one-stop agentic workflow for large-scale tool discovery, build specification inference, execution-based validation, and publication. Guided by a taxonomy spanning 90+ scientific and engineering domains, our discovery stage starts from a recall-oriented pool of over 500,000 public repositories and progressively filters it to 52,550 executable tool candidates under license- and quality-aware criteria. Deploy-Master transforms heterogeneous open-source repositories into runnable, containerized capabilities grounded in execution rather than documentation claims. In a single day, we performed 52,550 build attempts and constructed reproducible runtime environments for 50,112 scientific tools. Each successful tool is validated by a minimal executable command and registered in SciencePedia for search and reuse, enabling direct human use and optional agent-based invocation.\n  Beyond delivering runnable tools, we report a deployment trace at the scale of 50,000 tools, characterizing throughput, cost profiles, failure surfaces, and specification uncertainty that become visible only at scale.

However, whether LFMs can provide truly personalized treatment recommendations remains an open question. Recent research has revealed multiple challenges for personalization, including the fundamental generalizability paradox: models achieving high accuracy in one clinical study perform at chance level in others, demonstrating that personalization and external validity exist in tension. This exemplifies broader contradictions in AI-driven healthcare: the privacy-performance paradox, scale-specificity paradox, and the automation-empathy paradox. As another challenge, the degree of causal understanding required for personalized recommendations, as opposed to mere predictive capacities of LFMs, remains an open question. N-of-1 trials -- crossover self-experiments and the gold standard for individual causal inference in personalized medicine -- resolve these tensions by providing within-person causal evidence while preserving privacy through local experimentation. Despite their impressive capabilities, this paper argues that LFMs cannot replace N-of-1 trials. We argue that LFMs and N-of-1 trials are complementary: LFMs excel at rapid hypothesis generation from population patterns using multimodal data, while N-of-1 trials excel at causal validation for a given individual. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both to enable personalization and navigate the identified paradoxes: LFMs generate ranked intervention candidates with uncertainty estimates, which trigger subsequent N-of-1 trials. Clarifying the boundary between prediction and causation and explicitly addressing the paradoxical tensions are essential for responsible AI integration in personalized medicine.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684N-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u5e94\u4e92\u8865\u7ed3\u5408\uff1a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u7fa4\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5047\u8bbe\uff0cN-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\u5728\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u91cd\u77db\u76fe\uff1a\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e34\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u968f\u673a\uff08\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u6096\u8bba\uff09\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u77db\u76fe\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u77db\u76fe\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e0e\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u77db\u76fe\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6839\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5148\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7fa4\u4f53\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6392\u540d\u5e72\u9884\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848\u53ca\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u518d\u901a\u8fc7N-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff08\u4ea4\u53c9\u81ea\u8eab\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff09\u5bf9\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u6027AI\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff1a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5feb\u901f\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\uff0cN-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u56e0\u679c\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5171\u540c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6e05\u6670\u533a\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u3001\u660e\u786e\u5904\u7406AI\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u662f\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u6574\u5408\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002\u5927\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eN-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e92\u8865\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u63a8\u8350\u3002"}}

This design can be accurate and interpretable, but it makes inference expensive on CPU because each layer requires many spline evaluations. Standard quantization toolchains are also hard to apply because the main computation is not a matrix multiply but repeated spline basis evaluation. This paper introduces LUT-KAN, a segment-wise lookup-table (LUT) compilation and quantization method for PyKAN-style KAN layers. LUT-KAN converts each edge function into a per-segment LUT with affine int8/uint8 quantization and linear interpolation. The method provides an explicit and reproducible inference contract, including boundary conventions and out-of-bounds (OOB) policies. We propose an ``honest baseline'' methodology for speed evaluation: B-spline evaluation and LUT evaluation are compared under the same backend optimization (NumPy vs NumPy and Numba vs Numba), which separates representation gains from vectorization and JIT effects. Experiments include controlled sweeps over LUT resolution L in 16, 32, 64, 128 and two quantization schemes (symmetric int8 and asymmetric uint8). We report accuracy, speed, and memory metrics with mean and standard deviation across multiple seeds. A two-by-two OOB robustness matrix evaluates behavior under different boundary modes and OOB policies. In a case study, we compile a trained KAN model for DoS attack detection (CICIDS2017 pipeline) into LUT artifacts.

However, due to their data-driven and pattern-seeking nature, ML algorithms may develop decision logic that disproportionately distributes opportunities, benefits, resources, or information among different population groups, potentially harming marginalized communities. In response to such fairness concerns, the software engineering and ML communities have made significant efforts to establish the best practices for creating fair ML software. These include fairness interventions for training ML models, such as including sensitive features, selecting non-sensitive attributes, and applying bias mitigators. But how reliably can software professionals tasked with developing data-driven systems depend on these recommendations? And how well do these practices generalize in the presence of faulty labels, missing data, or distribution shifts?

Recent research has attempted to improve safety by training models to reason over safety rules before responding. However, a key issue lies in determining what form of safety reasoning effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, which is difficult to explicitly design or directly obtain. To address this, we propose \\textbf{STAR-S} (\\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{TA}ught \\textbf{R}easoning based on \\textbf{S}afety rules), a framework that integrates the learning of safety rule reasoning into a self-taught loop. The core of STAR-S involves eliciting reasoning and reflection guided by safety rules, then leveraging fine-tuning to enhance safety reasoning. Repeating this process creates a synergistic cycle. Improvements in the model's reasoning and interpretation of safety rules allow it to produce better reasoning data under safety rule prompts, which is then utilized for further training. Experiments show that STAR-S effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, outperforming baselines.

However, their efficacy often relies on large, labeled datasets, posing challenges for applications with limited data availability. Our research addresses these challenges by introducing an innovative approach that leverages projected quantum kernels (PQK) to enhance feature extraction for CNNs, specifically tailored for small datasets. Projected quantum kernels, derived from quantum computing principles, offer a promising avenue for capturing complex patterns and intricate data structures that traditional CNNs might miss. By incorporating these kernels into the feature extraction process, we improved the representational ability of CNNs. Our experiments demonstrated that, with 1000 training samples, the PQK-enhanced CNN achieved 95% accuracy on the MNIST dataset and 90% on the CIFAR-10 dataset, significantly outperforming the classical CNN, which achieved only 60% and 12% accuracy on the respective datasets. This research reveals the potential of quantum computing in overcoming data scarcity issues in machine learning and paves the way for future exploration of quantum-assisted neural networks, suggesting that projected quantum kernels can serve as a powerful approach for enhancing CNN-based classification in data-constrained environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Current benchmarks typically fluctuate between isolated code snippets and black-box evaluations. We present RepoReason, a white-box diagnostic benchmark centered on abductive assertion verification. To eliminate memorization while preserving authentic logical depth, we implement an execution-driven mutation framework that utilizes the environment as a semantic oracle to regenerate ground-truth states.

While process-level reward models offer a promising direction, existing LLM-based judges often produce noisy and inconsistent signals because they lack fine-grained, task-specific rubrics to distinguish high-level planning from low-level execution. In this work, we introduce SCRIBE (Skill-Conditioned Reward with Intermediate Behavioral Evaluation), a reinforcement learning framework that intervenes at a novel mid-level abstraction. SCRIBE grounds reward modeling in a curated library of skill prototypes, transforming open-ended LLM evaluation into a constrained verification problem. By routing each subgoal to a corresponding prototype, the reward model is equipped with precise, structured rubrics that substantially reduce reward variance.\n  Experimental results show that SCRIBE achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of reasoning and tool-use benchmarks. In particular, it improves the AIME25 accuracy of a Qwen3-4B model from 43.3% to 63.3%, and significantly increases success rates in complex multi-turn tool interactions.\n  Further analysis of training dynamics reveals a co-evolution across abstraction levels, where mastery of mid-level skills consistently precedes the emergence of effective high-level planning behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate that SCRIBE is additive to low-level tool optimizations, providing a scalable and complementary pathway toward more autonomous and reliable tool-using agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While the phenomenology of collapse is increasingly evident, rigorous methods to quantify and predict its onset in high-dimensional spaces remain elusive. In this paper, we introduce SIGMA (Spectral Inequalities for Gram Matrix Analysis), a unified framework that benchmarks model collapse through the spectral lens of the embedding Gram matrix. By deriving and utilizing deterministic and stochastic bounds on the matrix's spectrum, SIGMA provides a mathematically grounded metric to track the contraction of the representation space. Crucially, our stochastic formulation enables scalable estimation of these bounds, making the framework applicable to large-scale foundation models where full eigendecomposition is intractable. We demonstrate that SIGMA effectively captures the transition towards degenerate states, offering both theoretical insights into the mechanics of collapse and a practical, scalable tool for monitoring the health of recursive training pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, effective code generation requires models to understand and apply a wide range of language concepts. If the concepts exercised in benchmarks are not representative of those used in real-world projects, evaluations may yield incomplete. Despite this concern, the representativeness of code concepts in benchmarks has not been systematically examined.\n  To address this gap, we present the first empirical study that analyzes the representativeness of code generation benchmarks through the lens of Knowledge Units (KUs) - cohesive sets of programming language capabilities provided by language constructs and APIs. We analyze KU coverage in two widely used Python benchmarks, HumanEval and MBPP, and compare them with 30 real-world Python projects. Our results show that each benchmark covers only half of the identified 20 KUs, whereas projects exercise all KUs with relatively balanced distributions. In contrast, benchmark tasks exhibit highly skewed KU distributions.\n  To mitigate this misalignment, we propose a prompt-based LLM framework that synthesizes KU-based tasks to rebalance benchmark KU distributions and better align them with real-world usage. Using this framework, we generate 440 new tasks and augment existing benchmarks. The augmented benchmarks substantially improve KU coverage and achieve over a 60% improvement in distributional alignment. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on these augmented benchmarks reveal consistent and statistically significant performance drops (12.54-44.82%), indicating that existing benchmarks overestimate LLM performance due to their limited KU coverage. Our findings provide actionable guidance for building more realistic evaluations of LLM code-generation capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Currently, reasoning strategies are autonomously selected by LRMs themselves. However, such autonomous selection often produces inefficient or even erroneous reasoning paths. To make reasoning more reliable and flexible, it is important to develop methods for controlling reasoning strategies. Existing methods struggle to control fine-grained reasoning strategies due to conceptual entanglement in LRMs' hidden states. To address this, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose strategy-entangled hidden states into a disentangled feature space. To identify the few strategy-specific features from the vast pool of SAE features, we propose SAE-Steering, an efficient two-stage feature identification pipeline. SAE-Steering first recalls features that amplify the logits of strategy-specific keywords, filtering out over 99\\% of features, and then ranks the remaining features by their control effectiveness. Using the identified strategy-specific features as control vectors, SAE-Steering outperforms existing methods by over 15\\% in control effectiveness. Furthermore, controlling reasoning strategies can redirect LRMs from erroneous paths to correct ones, achieving a 7\\% absolute accuracy improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, its use in clinical practice is limited by cost, turnaround time, and tissue requirements, thereby restricting its application in the management of PDAC. We introduce PanSubNet, an interpretable deep learning framework that predicts therapy-relevant molecular subtypes directly from standard H&E-stained WSIs. PanSubNet was developed using data from 1,055 patients across two multi-institutional cohorts (PANCAN, n=846; TCGA, n=209) with paired histology and RNA-seq data. Ground-truth labels were derived using the validated Moffitt 50-gene signature refined by GATA6 expression. The model employs dual-scale architecture that fuses cellular-level morphology with tissue-level architecture, leveraging attention mechanisms for multi-scale representation learning and transparent feature attribution. On internal validation within PANCAN using five-fold cross-validation, PanSubNet achieved mean AUC of 88.5% with balanced sensitivity and specificity. External validation on the independent TCGA cohort without fine-tuning demonstrated robust generalizability (AUC 84.0%). PanSubNet preserved and, in metastatic disease, strengthened prognostic stratification compared to RNA-seq based labels. Prediction uncertainty linked to intermediate transcriptional states, not classification noise. Model predictions are aligned with established transcriptomic programs, differentiation markers, and DNA damage repair signatures. By enabling rapid, cost-effective molecular stratification from routine H&E-stained slides, PanSubNet offers a clinically deployable and interpretable tool for genetic subtyping.

However, current safety evaluations often overestimate robustness because existing automated attacks are limited by restrictive assumptions. They typically rely on handcrafted priors or require white-box access for gradient propagation. We challenge these constraints by demonstrating that token-level iterative optimization can succeed without gradients or priors. We introduce RAILS (RAndom Iterative Local Search), a framework that operates solely on model logits. RAILS matches the effectiveness of gradient-based methods through two key innovations: a novel auto-regressive loss that enforces exact prefix matching, and a history-based selection strategy that bridges the gap between the proxy optimization objective and the true attack success rate. Crucially, by eliminating gradient dependency, RAILS enables cross-tokenizer ensemble attacks. This allows for the discovery of shared adversarial patterns that generalize across disjoint vocabularies, significantly enhancing transferability to closed-source systems. Empirically, RAILS achieves near 100% success rates on multiple open-source models and high black-box attack transferability to closed-source systems like GPT and Gemini.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the diversity caused by the constant evolution of the ML ecosystem (e.g., algorithms, libraries, datasets) makes this task challenging. Existing approaches either depend on non-scalable, manual labeling, or on ML classifiers that do not properly support the diversity of the domain. These limitations highlight the need for more flexible and reliable solutions.\n  Objective: We evaluate whether Small Language Models (SLMs) can leverage their code understanding and classification abilities to address these limitations, and subsequently how they can advance our understanding of data science practices.\n  Method: We conduct a confirmatory study based on two reference works selected for their relevance regarding current state-of-the-art's limitations. First, we compare several SLMs using Cochran's Q test. The best-performing model is then evaluated against the reference studies using two distinct McNemar's tests. We further analyze how variations in taxonomy definitions affect performance through an additional Cochran's Q test.

Despite this vulnerability, conventional defense mechanisms remain ineffective as they overlook the unique reasoning dynamics of LRMs. In this work, we find that the emergence of safe-reminding phrases within thinking steps plays a pivotal role in ensuring LRM safety. Motivated by this finding, we propose SafeRemind, a decoding-time defense method that dynamically injects safe-reminding phrases into thinking steps. By leveraging entropy triggers to intervene at decision-locking points, SafeRemind redirects potentially harmful trajectories toward safer outcomes without requiring any parameter updates. Extensive evaluations across five LRMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that SafeRemind substantially enhances safety, achieving improvements of up to 45.5%p while preserving core reasoning utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We term this scar \\textit{Passive-Triggered Connectivity Collapse} (PTCC). Analysis of the Phi lineage reveals that PTCC appears and resolves across developmental stages, implicating brittle curriculum shifts rather than synthetic data per se. (2) PTCC reflects a specialization trade-off: strengthened formal routing at the expense of stylistic flexibility. (3) We identify four recurrent processing strategies; simple frozen-threshold rules enable perfect forensic identification across lineages. (4) Mechanistically, PTCC localizes to a sparse Layer 2 ``compensatory patch'' of heads that fails under syntactic stress; activation steering can partially restore connectivity, recovering $\\approx 38\\%$ of lost information flow.\n  Finally, dominant topological regimes track tokenization density more than language identity, suggesting ``healthy'' geometry varies systematically across scripts.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves accuracy but incurs prohibitive latency for real-time query correction. A potential solution is to output an answer before reasoning to reduce latency; however, under autoregressive decoding, the early answer is independent of subsequent reasoning, preventing the model from leveraging its reasoning capability to improve accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR), a novel approach that explicitly aligns a fast initial answer with post-hoc reasoning, enabling low-latency query correction without sacrificing reasoning-aware accuracy. SandwichR follows an Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm, producing an initial correction, an explicit reasoning process, and a final refined correction. To align the initial answer with post-reasoning insights, we design a consistency-aware reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: a dedicated consistency reward enforces alignment between the initial and final corrections, while margin-based rejection sampling prioritizes borderline samples where reasoning drives the most impactful corrective gains. Additionally, we construct a high-quality query correction dataset, addressing the lack of specialized benchmarks for complex query correction. Experimental results demonstrate that SandwichR achieves SOTA accuracy comparable to standard CoT while delivering a 40-70% latency reduction, resolving the latency-accuracy trade-off in online search.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we question this assumption by introducing COMMITTEEAUDIT, a post hoc framework that analyzes routing behavior at the level of expert groups rather than individual experts. Across three representative models and the MMLU benchmark, we uncover a domain-invariant Standing Committee. This is a compact coalition of routed experts that consistently captures the majority of routing mass across domains, layers, and routing budgets, even when architectures already include shared experts. Qualitative analysis further shows that Standing Committees anchor reasoning structure and syntax, while peripheral experts handle domain-specific knowledge. These findings reveal a strong structural bias toward centralized computation, suggesting that specialization in Mixture of Experts models is far less pervasive than commonly believed. This inherent bias also indicates that current training objectives, such as load-balancing losses that enforce uniform expert utilization, may be working against the model's natural optimization path, thereby limiting training efficiency and performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To fill this gap, we conducted an in-depth interview study with 26 experienced SE practitioners from different organisations and industries. We asked them about general problems encountered, as well as the relevance of 31 ITS smells (aka potentially problematic practices) discussed in the literature. By applying Thematic Analysis to the interview notes, we identified 14 common problems including issue findability, zombie issues, workflow bloat, and lack of workflow enforcement. Participants also stated that many of the ITS smells do not occur or are not problematic.

Previous work successfully demonstrated that automated planners, using general domain-independent heuristics, are able to generate personalized treatments, when the domain and problems are modeled using a general domain description language (\\pddlp). Unfortunately, this process was limited in practice to consider no more than seven medications. In clinical terms, this is a non-starter. In this paper, we explore the use of automatically-generated domain- and problem-specific heuristics to be used with general search, as a method of scaling up medication planning to levels allowing closer work with clinicians. Specifically, we specify the domain programmatically (specifying an initial state and a successor generation procedure), and use an LLM to generate a problem specific heuristic that can be used by a fixed search algorithm (GBFS). The results indicate dramatic improvements in coverage and planning time, scaling up the number of medications to at least 28, and bringing medication planning one step closer to practical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7528\u836f\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u836f\u7269\u6570\u91cf\u9650\u5236\uff08\u6700\u591a7\u79cd\uff09\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u5b9a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u9886\u57df\u548cLLM\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u5b9a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408GBFS\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u6269\u5c55\u81f328\u79cd\u836f\u7269\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7528\u836f\u89c4\u5212\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u4e2a\u4f53\u60a3\u8005\u9009\u62e9\u836f\u7269\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u7ed9\u836f\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u533b\u7597\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u5148\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u72ec\u7acb\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u591a\u53ea\u80fd\u5904\u74067\u79cd\u836f\u7269\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u662f\u4e0d\u591f\u7684\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u89c4\u6a21\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u591a\u836f\u7269\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u9886\u57df\u5b9a\u4e49\uff08\u6307\u5b9a\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u540e\u7ee7\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8d2a\u5fc3\u6700\u4f73\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\uff08GBFS\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u901a\u7528\u7684\u9886\u57df\u72ec\u7acb\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff1a\u89c4\u5212\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u95f4\u660e\u663e\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u81f3\u5c1128\u79cd\u836f\u7269\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u6700\u591a\u5904\u74067\u79cd\u836f\u7269\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u5b9a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u901a\u7528\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5927\u5e45\u6269\u5c55\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7528\u836f\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u5c06\u5904\u7406\u836f\u7269\u6570\u91cf\u4ece7\u79cd\u63d0\u5347\u523028\u79cd\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

In recent years, there have been significant advances in evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for news video understanding. However, existing benchmarks largely focus on single-source, intra-video reasoning, where each report is processed in isolation. In contrast, real-world news consumption is inherently multi-sourced: the same event is reported by different outlets with complementary details, distinct narrative choices, and sometimes conflicting claims that unfold over time. Robust news understanding, therefore, requires models to compare perspectives from different sources, align multimodal evidence across sources, and synthesize multi-source information. To fill this gap, we introduce VNU-Bench, the first benchmark for multi-source, cross-video understanding in the news domain. We design a set of new question types that are unique in testing models' ability of understanding multi-source multimodal news from a variety of different angles. We design a novel hybrid human-model QA generation process that addresses the issues of scalability and quality control in building a large dataset for cross-source news understanding. The dataset comprises 429 news groups, 1,405 videos, and 2,501 high-quality questions. Comprehensive evaluation of both closed- and open-source multimodal models shows that VNU-Bench poses substantial challenges for current MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86VNU-Bench\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u65b0\u95fb\u9886\u57df\u591a\u6e90\u8de8\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b429\u4e2a\u65b0\u95fb\u7ec4\u30011405\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u548c2501\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6e90\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b0\u95fb\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u6d88\u8d39\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u591a\u6e90\u7684\uff0c\u540c\u4e00\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7531\u4e0d\u540c\u5a92\u4f53\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u5ea6\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8865\u5145\u7ec6\u8282\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u53d9\u4e8b\u9009\u62e9\u751a\u81f3\u77db\u76fe\u4e3b\u5f20\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u6e90\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\u6bd4\u8f83\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6574\u5408\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e13\u95e8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u591a\u6e90\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b0\u95fb\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u578b\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u4eba\u673a\u95ee\u7b54\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u6e90\u65b0\u95fb\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b429\u4e2a\u65b0\u95fb\u7ec4\u30011405\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u548c2501\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u7684VNU-Bench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u5bf9\u95ed\u6e90\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "VNU-Bench\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u591a\u6e90\u8de8\u89c6\u9891\u65b0\u95fb\u7406\u89e3\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u591a\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\u4e2d\u6bd4\u8f83\u89c6\u89d2\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc1\u636e\u548c\u6574\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

Among other things, explainablility for deep neural networks has been a topic of intensive research due to the meteoric rise in prominence of deep neural networks and their \"black-box\" nature. xAI approaches can be characterized along different dimensions such as their scope (global versus local explanations) or underlying methodologies (statistic-based versus rule-based strategies). Methods generating global explanations aim to provide reasoning process applicable to all possible output classes while local explanation methods focus only on a single, specific class. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a well-known statistical technique, identifies important features of a network. Deep neural network rule extraction method constructs IF-THEN rules that link input conditions to a class. Another approach focuses on generating counterfactuals which help explain how small changes to an input can affect the model's predictions. However, these techniques primarily focus on the input-output relationship and thus neglect the structure of the network in explanation generation.   In this work, we propose xDNN(ASP), an explanation generation system for deep neural networks that provides global explanations. Given a neural network model and its training data, xDNN(ASP) extracts a logic program under answer set semantics that-in the ideal case-represents the trained model, i.e., answer sets of the extracted program correspond one-to-one to input-output pairs of the network. We demonstrate experimentally, using two synthetic datasets, that not only the extracted logic program maintains a high-level of accuracy in the prediction task, but it also provides valuable information for the understanding of the model such as the importance of features as well as the impact of hidden nodes on the prediction. The latter can be used as a guide for reducing the number of nodes used in hidden layers, i.e., providing a means for optimizing the network.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Early and accurate identification of failure zones in landslide-prone areas is crucial for effective geohazard mitigation. While existing approaches typically rely on surface displacement data analyzed through statistical or machine learning techniques, they often fall short in capturing both the spatial correlations and temporal dynamics that are inherent in such data. To address this gap, we focus on ground-monitored landslides and introduce a novel approach that jointly incorporates spatial and temporal information, enabling the detection of complex landslides and including multiple successive failures occurring in distinct areas of the same slope. To be specific, our method builds upon an existing LID-based technique, known as sLID. We extend its capabilities in three key ways. (1) Kinematic enhancement: we incorporate velocity into the sLID computation to better capture short-term temporal dependencies and deformation rate relationships. (2) Spatial fusion: we apply Bayesian estimation to aggregate sLID values across spatial neighborhoods, effectively embedding spatial correlations into the LID scores. (3) Temporal modeling: we introduce a temporal variant, tLID, that learns long-term dynamics from time series data, providing a robust temporal representation of displacement behavior. Finally, we integrate both components into a unified framework, referred to as spatiotemporal LID (stLID), to identify samples that are anomalous in either or both dimensions. Extensive experiments show that stLID consistently outperforms existing methods in failure detection precision and lead-time.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, extending this paradigm to financial decision is challenged by the market's stochastic nature: rewards are verifiable but inherently noisy, causing standard RL to degenerate into reward hacking. To address this, we propose Trade-R1, a model training framework that bridges verifiable rewards to stochastic environments via process-level reasoning verification. Our key innovation is a verification method that transforms the problem of evaluating reasoning over lengthy financial documents into a structured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) task. We construct a triangular consistency metric, assessing pairwise alignment between retrieved evidence, reasoning chains, and decisions to serve as a validity filter for noisy market returns. We explore two reward integration strategies: Fixed-effect Semantic Reward (FSR) for stable alignment signals, and Dynamic-effect Semantic Reward (DSR) for coupled magnitude optimization. Experiments on different country asset selection demonstrate that our paradigm reduces reward hacking, with DSR achieving superior cross-market generalization while maintaining the highest reasoning consistency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To this end, we build the first unified theoretical framework that rigorously derives these practices as optimal sparse posterior approximation and prior regularization from a Bayesian perspective, while simultaneously framing them as mechanisms to minimize routing ambiguity and maximize channel capacity from an information-theoretic perspective. We also pinpoint the inherent combinatorial hardness of routing, defining it as the NP-hard sparse subset selection problem. We rigorously prove the existence of a \"Coherence Barrier\"; when expert representations exhibit high mutual coherence, greedy routing strategies theoretically fail to recover the optimal expert subset. Importantly, we formally verify that imposing geometric orthogonality in the expert feature space is sufficient to narrow the divide between the NP-hard global optimum and polynomial-time greedy approximation.

However, this paradigm incurs substantial deployment costs as models often exhibit excessive verbosity on simple queries. Existing efficient reasoning methods relying on explicit length penalties often introduce optimization conflicts and leave the generative mechanisms driving overthinking largely unexamined. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon termed length shift where models increasingly generate unnecessary reasoning on trivial inputs during training. To address this, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT), a training-time intervention that selectively suppresses redundant tokens. This method targets only the extreme tail of response lengths within fully correct rollout groups while preserving long-horizon reasoning capabilities for complex problems. To complement this intervention and ensure stable convergence, we further incorporate auxiliary KL regularization and predictive dynamic sampling. Experimental results across multiple model scales demonstrate that our approach significantly pushes the efficiency-performance Pareto frontier outward.

Existing detection methods mainly detect jailbreak status relying on jailbreak templates present in the training data. However, few studies address the more realistic and challenging zero-shot jailbreak detection setting, where no jailbreak templates are available during training. This setting better reflects real-world scenarios where new attacks continually emerge and evolve. To address this challenge, we propose a layer-wise, module-wise, and token-wise amplification framework that progressively magnifies internal feature discrepancies between benign and jailbreak prompts. We uncover safety-relevant layers, identify specific modules that inherently encode zero-shot discriminative signals, and localize informative safety tokens. Building upon these insights, we introduce ALERT (Amplification-based Jailbreak Detector), an efficient and effective zero-shot jailbreak detector that introduces two independent yet complementary classifiers on amplified representations. Extensive experiments on three safety benchmarks demonstrate that ALERT achieves consistently strong zero-shot detection performance. Specifically, (i) across all datasets and attack strategies, ALERT reliably ranks among the top two methods, and (ii) it outperforms the second-best baseline by at least 10% in average Accuracy and F1-score, and sometimes by up to 40%.", "AI": {"tldr": "ALERT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8d8a\u72f1\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u653e\u5927\u826f\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u8d8a\u72f1\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0\u578b\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u6a21\u677f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u65b0\u578b\u653b\u51fb\u4e0d\u65ad\u6d8c\u73b0\u548c\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8d8a\u72f1\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5c42\u3001\u5206\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u5206token\u7684\u653e\u5927\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u653e\u5927\u826f\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u8d8a\u72f1\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u8bc6\u522b\u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u5c42\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5185\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5224\u522b\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5b89\u5168token\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u4e86ALERT\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u4f46\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5bf9\u653e\u5927\u540e\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cALERT\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff1a(i)\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\uff0cALERT\u90fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u6392\u540d\u524d\u4e24\u4f4d\uff1b(ii)\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u81f3\u5c11\u8d85\u8fc7\u7b2c\u4e8c\u597d\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd510%\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc740%\u3002", "conclusion": "ALERT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8d8a\u72f1\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u653e\u5927\u540e\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0\u578b\u3001\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive benchmarking study comparing traditional machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and large language model (LLM) approaches for mental health forecasting using the College Experience Sensing (CES) dataset, the most extensive longitudinal dataset of college student mental health to date. We systematically evaluate models across temporal windows, feature granularities, personalization strategies, and class imbalance handling. Our results show that DL models, particularly Transformer (Macro-F1 = 0.58), achieve the best overall performance, while LLMs show strength in contextual reasoning but weaker temporal modeling.

We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding drift phenomena, proposing three distinct manifestations: semantic drift (progressive deviation from original intent), coordination drift (breakdown in multi-agent consensus mechanisms), and behavioral drift (emergence of unintended strategies).\n  We introduce the Agent Stability Index (ASI), a novel composite metric framework for quantifying drift across twelve dimensions, including response consistency, tool usage patterns, reasoning pathway stability, and inter-agent agreement rates. Through simulation-based analysis and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate how unchecked agent drift can lead to substantial reductions in task completion accuracy and increased human intervention requirements.\n  We propose three mitigation strategies: episodic memory consolidation, drift-aware routing protocols, and adaptive behavioral anchoring. Theoretical analysis suggests these approaches can significantly reduce drift-related errors while maintaining system throughput.

Available at https://openreview.net/forum?id=Rlk1bWe2ii", "summary": "Recent studies explored integrating state-space search algorithms with Language Models (LM) to perform look-ahead on the token generation process, the ''Tree-of-Thoughts'' (ToT), generated by LMs, thereby improving performance on problem-solving tasks. However, the affiliated search algorithms often overlook the significant computational costs associated with LM inference, particularly in scenarios with constrained computational budgets. Consequently, we address the problem of improving LM performance on problem-solving tasks under limited computational budgets. We demonstrate how the probabilities assigned to thoughts by LMs can serve as a heuristic to guide search within the ToT framework, thereby reducing the number of thought evaluations. Building on this insight, we adapt a heuristic search algorithm, Levin Tree Search (LTS), to the ToT framework, which leverages LMs as policies to guide the tree exploration efficiently. We extend the theoretical results of LTS by showing that, for ToT (a pruned tree), LTS guarantees a bound on the number of states expanded, and consequently, on the number of thoughts generated. Additionally, we analyze the sensitivity of this bound to the temperature values commonly used in the final softmax layer of the LM. Empirical evaluation under a fixed LM query budget demonstrates that LTS consistently achieves comparable or higher accuracy than baseline search algorithms within the ToT framework, across three domains (Blocksworld, PrOntoQA, Array Sorting) and four distinct LMs. These findings highlight the efficacy of LTS on ToT, particularly in enabling cost-effective and time-efficient problem-solving, making it well-suited for latency-critical and resource-constrained applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06Levin\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u9002\u914d\u5230Tree-of-Thoughts\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u601d\u8003\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u56db\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u601d\u8003\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u5c06Levin\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u9002\u914d\u5230Tree-of-Thoughts\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6982\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6765\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u6811\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u601d\u8003\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u7ed1\u5b9a\u5bf9\u6e29\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u67e5\u8be2\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0cLTS\u5728\u5404\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u601d\u8003\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "LTS\u5728Tree-of-Thoughts\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u786e\u4fdd\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u654f\u611f\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

However, simulator outputs often exhibit systematic bias, while ground-truth measurements are costly and scarce. We study a stochastic shortest-path problem in which a planner has access to abundant synthetic samples, limited real-world observations, and an edge-similarity structure capturing expected behavioral similarity across links. We model the simulator-to-reality discrepancy as an unknown, edge-specific bias that varies smoothly over the similarity graph, and estimate it using Laplacian-regularized least squares. This approach yields calibrated edge cost estimates even in data-scarce regimes. We establish finite-sample error bounds, translate estimation error into path-level suboptimality guarantees, and propose a computable, data-driven certificate that verifies near-optimality of a candidate route. For cold-start settings without initial real data, we develop a bias-aware active learning algorithm that leverages the simulator and adaptively selects edges to measure until a prescribed accuracy is met.

This framework enables the operator to inherit the probabilistic structure of the underlying process, making it suitable for modeling and approximating stochastic signals. We establish mean-square convergence of K-SNNOs to the target stochastic process and derive quantitative error estimates expressing the rate of approximation in terms of the modulus of continuity.

In this paper, we propose ReLA, a reinforcement-learning (RL) scheduler built on structured representation learning and aggregation. ReLA first learns diverse representations from scheduling entities, including job operations and machines, using two intra-entity learning modules with self-attention and convolution and one inter-entity learning module with cross-attention. These modules are applied in a multi-scale architecture, and their outputs are aggregated to support RL decision-making. Across experiments on small, medium, and large job instances, ReLA achieves the best makespan in most tested settings over the latest solutions. On non-large instances, ReLA reduces the optimality gap of the SOTA baseline by 13.0%, while on large-scale instances it reduces the gap by 78.6%, with the average optimality gaps lowered to 7.3% and 2.1%, respectively.

A topic of continued interest in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence is whether some neurons behave like grandmother cells, i.e., neurons that are inherently interpretable because they exclusively respond to single concepts. In this work, we propose two information-theoretic measures that quantify the neuronal saliency and selectivity for single concepts.

As a result, valuable supervision from costly rollouts remains underutilized.\n  We propose AMIR-GRPO, which augments GRPO with an implicit DPO-style contrastive regularizer constructed directly from intra-group reward rankings, requiring no additional annotations. This mechanism amplifies suppression of low-reward trajectories, attenuates response-level length bias, and transforms each rollout group into a denser set of supervision constraints.

However, their application to Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) remains constrained by the limited uncertainty quantification (UQ) capabilities. Most existing PINN-based prognostics approaches are deterministic or account only for epistemic uncertainty, limiting their suitability for risk-aware decision-making. This work introduces a heteroscedastic Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) framework that jointly models epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, yielding full predictive posteriors for spatiotemporal insulation material ageing estimation. The approach integrates Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) with physics-based residual enforcement and prior distributions, enabling probabilistic inference within a physics-informed learning architecture. The framework is evaluated on transformer insulation ageing application, validated with a finite-element thermal model and field measurements from a solar power plant, and benchmarked against deterministic PINNs, dropout-based PINNs (d-PINNs), and alternative B-PINN variants. Results show that the proposed B-PINN provides improved predictive accuracy and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates than competing approaches. A systematic sensitivity study further analyzes the impact of boundary-condition, initial-condition, and residual sampling strategies on accuracy, calibration, and generalization. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of Bayesian physics-informed learning to support uncertainty-aware prognostics and informed decision-making in transformer asset management.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this limitation, we propose a novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder with Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization, RRE-PPO4Pred, which significantly improves time series modeling capacity and forecasting accuracy of the RNN models. The core innovations of this method are: (1) A novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder (RRE) framework that enhances RNNs by formulating their internal adaptation as a Markov Decision Process, creating a unified decision environment capable of learning input feature selection, hidden skip connection, and output target selection; (2) An improved Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, termed PPO4Pred, which is equipped with a Transformer-based agent for temporal reasoning and develops a dynamic transition sampling strategy to enhance sampling efficiency; (3) A co-evolutionary optimization paradigm to facilitate the learning of the RNN predictor and the policy agent, providing adaptive and interactive time series modeling.

However, general-purpose, reaction-wise descriptors remain scarce. This study introduces RXNEmb, a novel reaction-level descriptor derived from RXNGraphormer, a model pre-trained to distinguish real reactions from fictitious ones with erroneous bond changes, thereby learning intrinsic bond formation and cleavage patterns. We demonstrate its utility by data-driven re-clustering of the USPTO-50k dataset, yielding a classification that more directly reflects bond-change similarities than rule-based categories. Combined with dimensionality reduction, RXNEmb enables visualization of reaction space diversity. Furthermore, attention weight analysis reveals the model's focus on chemically critical sites, providing mechanistic insight. RXNEmb serves as a powerful, interpretable tool for reaction fingerprinting and analysis, paving the way for more data-centric approaches in reaction analysis and discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

First, we design a graph reconstruction attack, which can reconstruct graphs structurally similar to those training graphs from the generated graphs. Second, we propose a property inference attack to infer the properties of the training graphs, such as the average graph density and the distribution of densities, from the generated graphs. Third, we develop two membership inference attacks to determine whether a given graph is present in the training set. Extensive experiments on three different types of graph generative diffusion models and six real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks, significantly outperforming the baseline approaches. Finally, we propose two defense mechanisms that mitigate these inference attacks and achieve a better trade-off between defense strength and target model utility than existing methods.

We introduce TreeAdv (Tree-Structured Advantage Redistribution for Group-Based RL), which makes the tree structure of group rollouts explicit for both exploration and advantage assignment. Specifically, TreeAdv builds a group of trees (a forest) based on an entropy-driven sampling method where each tree branches at high-uncertainty decisions while sharing low-uncertainty tokens across rollouts. Then, TreeAdv aggregates token-level advantages for internal tree segments by redistributing the advantages of complete rollouts (all leaf nodes), and TreeAdv can easily apply to group-based objectives such as GRPO or GSPO. Across 10 math reasoning benchmarks, TreeAdv consistently outperforms GRPO and GSPO, while using substantially fewer generated tokens under identical supervision, data, and decoding budgets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The lack of experimentally resolved protein structures limits the performance of structure-based machine learning models, which generally outperform sequence-based methods. In order to overcome this constraint, we suggest a regression framework based on knowledge distillation that uses protein structural data during training and only needs sequence data during inference. The suggested method uses binding affinity labels and intermediate feature representations to jointly supervise the training of a sequence-based student network under the guidance of a structure-informed teacher network. Leave-One-Complex-Out (LOCO) cross-validation was used to assess the framework on a non-redundant protein--protein binding affinity benchmark dataset. A maximum Pearson correlation coefficient (P_r) of 0.375 and an RMSE of 2.712 kcal/mol were obtained by sequence-only baseline models, whereas a P_r of 0.512 and an RMSE of 2.445 kcal/mol were obtained by structure-based models. With a P_r of 0.481 and an RMSE of 2.488 kcal/mol, the distillation-based student model greatly enhanced sequence-only performance. Improved agreement and decreased bias were further confirmed by thorough error analyses. With the potential to close the performance gap between sequence-based and structure-based models as larger datasets become available, these findings show that knowledge distillation is an efficient method for transferring structural knowledge to sequence-based predictors.

In this note, we elucidate the geometric interpretation of the algorithm within the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS).

Exploration suffers from low success rates on difficult tasks and high costs of repeated rollouts from scratch. Exploitation suffers from coarse credit assignment and training instability: Trajectory-level rewards penalize valid prefixes for later errors, and failure-dominated groups overwhelm the few positive signals, leaving optimization without constructive direction. To this end, we propose R$^3$L, Reflect-then-Retry Reinforcement Learning with Language-Guided Exploration, Pivotal Credit, and Positive Amplification. To synthesize high-quality trajectories, R$^3$L shifts from stochastic sampling to active synthesis via reflect-then-retry, leveraging language feedback to diagnose errors, transform failed attempts into successful ones, and reduce rollout costs by restarting from identified failure points. With errors diagnosed and localized, Pivotal Credit Assignment updates only the diverging suffix where contrastive signals exist, excluding the shared prefix from gradient update. Since failures dominate on difficult tasks and reflect-then-retry produces off-policy data, risking training instability, Positive Amplification upweights successful trajectories to ensure positive signals guide the optimization process.

Currently, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) stands as the dominant algorithm in this domain due to its stable training and critic-free efficiency. However, we argue that GRPO suffers from a structural limitation: it imposes a uniform, static trust region constraint across all samples. This design implicitly assumes signal homogeneity, a premise misaligned with the heterogeneous nature of outcome-driven learning, where advantage magnitudes and variances fluctuate significantly.

A common strategy in LLM fine-tuning is curriculum learning, which pre-orders training samples based on metrics like difficulty to improve learning efficiency compared to a random sampling strategy. However, most existing methods for LLM fine-tuning rely on a static curriculum, designed prior to training, which lacks adaptability to the model's evolving needs during fine-tuning. To address this, we propose EDCO, a novel framework based on two key concepts: inference entropy and dynamic curriculum orchestration. Inspired by recent findings that maintaining high answer entropy benefits long-term reasoning gains, EDCO prioritizes samples with high inference entropy in a continuously adapted curriculum. EDCO integrates three core components: an efficient entropy estimator that uses prefix tokens to approximate full-sequence entropy, an entropy-based curriculum generator that selects data points with the highest inference entropy, and an LLM trainer that optimizes the model on the selected curriculum. Comprehensive experiments in communication, medicine and law domains, EDCO outperforms traditional curriculum strategies for fine-tuning Qwen3-4B and Llama3.2-3B models under supervised and reinforcement learning settings. Furthermore, the proposed efficient entropy estimation reduces computational time by 83.5% while maintaining high accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Yet forecast users often face a difficult trade-off. Many decision-relevant targets are functionals of the atmospheric state variables, such as extrema, accumulations, and threshold exceedances, rather than state variables themselves. As a result, users must estimate these targets via post-processing, which can be suboptimal and can introduce structural bias. The core issue is that decisions depend on distributions over these functionals that the model is not trained to learn directly.\n  In this work, we introduce GEM-2, a probabilistic transformer that jointly learns global atmospheric dynamics alongside a suite of variables that users directly act upon. Using this training recipe, we show that a lightweight (~275M params) and computationally efficient (~20-100x training speedup relative to state-of-the-art) transformer trained on the CRPS objective can directly outperform operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and be competitive with ML models that rely on expensive multi-step diffusion processes or require bespoke multi-stage fine-tuning strategies.

In our Latent Instance Difficulty (LID) model, each input's target variance is governed by a latent ``precision'' drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. While generalization loss recovers standard scaling laws, our main contribution connects this to inference. The pass@$k$ failure rate exhibits a power-law decay, $k^{-\u03b2_\\text{eff}}$, but the observed exponent $\u03b2_\\text{eff}$ is training-dependent. It grows with sample size $N$ before saturating at an intrinsic limit $\u03b2$ set by the difficulty distribution's tail. This coupling reveals that learning shrinks the ``hard tail'' of the error distribution: improvements in the model's generalization error steepen the pass@$k$ curve until irreducible target variance dominates. The LID model yields testable, closed-form predictions for this behavior, including a compute-allocation rule that favors training before saturation and inference attempts after.

Zero-shot node classification in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) presents a significant challenge, particularly due to the absence of labeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel Zero-shot Prompt Tuning (ZPT) framework to address this problem by leveraging a Universal Bimodal Conditional Generator (UBCG). Our approach begins with pre-training a graph-language model to capture both the graph structure and the associated textual descriptions of each node. Following this, a conditional generative model is trained to learn the joint distribution of nodes in both graph and text modalities, enabling the generation of synthetic samples for each class based solely on the class name. These synthetic node and text embeddings are subsequently used to perform continuous prompt tuning, facilitating effective node classification in a zero-shot setting. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our framework performs better than existing state-of-the-art baselines. We also provide ablation studies to validate the contribution of the bimodal generator.

Semantic backdoors are significantly harder to detect than backdoors that are based on trigger patterns due to the lack of such clearly identifiable patterns. We tackle this problem under the assumption that the clean training dataset and the training recipe of the model are both known. These assumptions are motivated by a consumer protection scenario, in which the responsible authority performs mystery shopping to test a machine learning service provider. In this scenario, the authority uses the provider's resources and tools to train a model on a given dataset and tests whether the provider included a backdoor. In our proposed approach, the authority creates a reference model pool by training a small number of clean and poisoned models using trusted infrastructure, and calibrates a model distance threshold to identify clean models. We propose and experimentally analyze a number of approaches to compute model distances and we also test a scenario where the provider performs an adaptive attack to avoid detection.

The model distance is best measured using a set of input samples generated by inverting the models in such a way as to maximize the distance from clean samples.

Although GANs have shown remarkable success in generating realistic data, they often lack mechanisms to incorporate prior knowledge or enforce logical consistency, limiting their applicability in domains requiring rule adherence. LTNs provide a principled way to integrate first-order logic with neural networks, enabling models to reason over and satisfy logical constraints. By combining the strengths of GANs for realistic data synthesis with LTNs for logical reasoning, we gain valuable insights into how logical constraints influence the generative process while improving both the diversity and logical consistency of the generated samples. We evaluate LTN-GAN across multiple datasets, including synthetic datasets (gaussian, grid, rings) and the MNIST dataset, demonstrating that our model significantly outperforms traditional GANs in terms of adherence to predefined logical constraints while maintaining the quality and diversity of generated samples.

To address these limitations, we introduce FALCON, a framework that enhances the effectiveness of OSFL over non-IID image data. The core idea of FALCON is to leverage the feature-aware hierarchical token sequences generation and knowledge distillation into OSFL. First, each client leverages a pretrained visual encoder with hierarchical scale encoding to compress images into hierarchical token sequences, which capture multi-scale semantics. Second, a multi-scale autoregressive transformer generator is used to model the distribution of these token sequences and generate the synthetic sequences. Third, clients upload the synthetic sequences along with the local classifier trained on the real token sequences to the server. Finally, the server incorporates knowledge distillation into global training to reduce reliance on precise distribution modeling. Experiments on medical and natural image datasets validate the effectiveness of FALCON in diverse non-IID scenarios, outperforming the best OSFL baselines by 9.58% in average accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Memory replay methods are widely used for their practicality and effectiveness, but most rely on fixed, step-based heuristics that often misalign with the model's actual learning progress, since identical training steps can result in varying degrees of parameter change. Motivated by recent findings that LLM forgetting mirrors the Ebbinghaus human forgetting curve, we propose FOREVER (FORgEtting curVe-inspired mEmory Replay), a novel CL framework that aligns replay schedules with a model-centric notion of time. FOREVER defines model time using the magnitude of optimizer updates, allowing forgetting curve-inspired replay intervals to align with the model's internal evolution rather than raw training steps. Building on this approach, FOREVER incorporates a forgetting curve-based replay scheduler to determine when to replay and an intensity-aware regularization mechanism to adaptively control how to replay. Extensive experiments on three CL benchmarks and models ranging from 0.6B to 13B parameters demonstrate that FOREVER consistently mitigates catastrophic forgetting.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our use of explainability techniques, including SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), enabled us to illustrate significant feature-cancer stage interactions that would have remained hidden in traditional black-box models. We identified how certain demographic and clinical variables influenced survival differently across cancer stages and types.

Due to better interpretability, it is a machine learning paradigm particularly powerful for scientific discovery.

Some previous works allow only \"non-shared\" (category-value-specific) parameters, and others also incorporate \"shared\" (category-value-agnostic) parameters. We expand upon those efforts by considering multiple categorical variables, and introducing intermediate levels of parameter sharing. With two categorical variables, an intermediate level of parameter sharing emerges, i.e., parameters which are shared across either category but change across the other. The new approach potentially decreases the number of parameters, while revealing additional information about the problem. Using a synthetic, fitting-only example, we test the limits of this setup in terms of data requirement reduction and transfer learning. As a real-world symbolic regression example, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach on an astrophysics dataset used in a previous study, which considered only one categorical variable. We achieve a similar fit quality but require significantly fewer individual parameters, and extract additional information about the problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The highly nonlinear motion-to-configuration relationship means small perturbations in joint positions drastically alter trajectories, while the combinatorially expanding design space renders conventional optimization and heuristic methods computationally intractable. We introduce an autoregressive diffusion framework that exploits the dyadic nature of linkage assembly by representing mechanisms as sequentially constructed graphs, where nodes correspond to joints and edges to rigid links. Our approach combines a causal transformer with a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), both conditioned on target trajectories encoded via a transformer encoder. The causal transformer autoregressively predicts discrete topology node-by-node, while the DDPM refines each node's spatial coordinates and edge connectivity to previously generated nodes. This sequential generation enables adaptive trial-and-error synthesis where problematic nodes exhibiting kinematic locking or collisions can be selectively regenerated, allowing autonomous correction of degenerate configurations during design. Our graph-based, data-driven methodology surpasses traditional optimization approaches, enabling scalable inverse design that generalizes to mechanisms with arbitrary node counts. We demonstrate successful synthesis of linkage systems containing up to 20 nodes with extensibility to N-node architectures. This work advances autoregressive graph generation methodologies and computational kinematic synthesis, establishing new paradigms for scalable inverse design of complex mechanical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The learning algorithm approximates the Koopman operator which globally linearizes the dynamics in a (potentially infinite) feature space associated with a kernel function. The distance metric is computed in feature space independently of its dimensionality by using the kernel trick common in machine learning.

This approach augments limited real data with causally informed synthetic examples, preserving feature dependencies while expanding training diversity. Evaluated across 33 classification datasets from TabArena and over 2300 fine-tuning runs, our CausalMixFT method consistently improves median normalized ROC-AUC from 0.10 (standard fine-tuning) to 0.12, outperforming purely statistical generators such as CTGAN (-0.01), TabEBM (-0.04), and TableAugment (-0.09). Moreover, it narrows the median validation-test performance correlation gap from 0.67 to 0.30, enabling more reliable validation-based early stopping, a key step toward improving fine-tuning stability under data scarcity.

However, MEDS is defined as a data-format specification and does not natively provide integration with the Semantic Web ecosystem. In this article, we introduce MEDS-OWL, a lightweight OWL ontology that provides formal concepts and relations to enable representing MEDS datasets as RDF graphs.

We demonstrate the approach on a synthetic clinical dataset that describes patient care pathways for ruptured intracranial aneurysms and validate the resulting graph using SHACL constraints. The first release of MEDS-OWL comprises 13 classes, 10 object properties, 20 data properties, and 24 OWL axioms.
