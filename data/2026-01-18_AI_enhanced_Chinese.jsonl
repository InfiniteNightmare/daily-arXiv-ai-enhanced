Conversely, static multi-agent swarms introduce significant latency and resource overhead. This paper introduces a Self-Evolving Concierge System, a novel architecture utilizing a Dynamic Mixture of Experts (DMoE) approach. Unlike recent self-improving agents that rewrite their own codebase, our system preserves stability by dynamically restructuring its runtime environment: \"hiring\" specialized sub-agents based on real-time conversation analysis. We introduce an asynchronous \"Meta-Cognition Engine\" that detects capability gaps, a Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy for resource constraints, and a novel \"Surgical History Pruning\" mechanism to mitigate refusal bias. Experimental results demonstrate that this architecture maintains high task success rates while minimizing token consumption compared to static agent swarms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSelf-Evolving Concierge System\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408(DMoE)\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6cdb\u5316-\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6cdb\u5316-\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u56f0\u5883\uff1a\u5355\u4e00\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u5177\u8fc7\u591a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c61\u67d3\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u800c\u9759\u6001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u96c6\u7fa4\u5219\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408(DMoE)\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u5f15\u64ce\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u96c7\u4f63\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u5b50\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528LRU\u9a71\u9010\u7b56\u7565\u5904\u7406\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5916\u79d1\u624b\u672f\u5f0f\u5386\u53f2\u4fee\u526a\u673a\u5236\u7f13\u89e3\u62d2\u7edd\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u9759\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u96c6\u7fa4\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4ee4\u724c\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This paper develops a general framework for thinking about the existential risk of AI systems. We analyze a two premise argument that AI systems pose a threat to humanity. Premise one: AI systems will become extremely powerful. Premise two: if AI systems become extremely powerful, they will destroy humanity. We use these two premises to construct a taxonomy of survival stories, in which humanity survives into the far future. In each survival story, one of the two premises fails. Either scientific barriers prevent AI systems from becoming extremely powerful; or humanity bans research into AI systems, thereby preventing them from becoming extremely powerful; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because their goals prevent them from doing so; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because we can reliably detect and disable systems that have the goal of doing so. We argue that different survival stories face different challenges. We also argue that different survival stories motivate different responses to the threats from AI. Finally, we use our taxonomy to produce rough estimates of P(doom), the probability that humanity will be destroyed by AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

STMs simplify atomicity. Recent STMs can achieve good performance for some workloads but they have some limitations. In particular, STMs typically cannot support long-running reads which access a large number of addresses that are frequently updated. Multiversioning is a common approach used to support this type of workload. However, multiversioning is often expensive and can reduce the performance of transactions where versioning is not necessary. In this work we present Multiverse, a new STM that combines the best of both unversioned TM and multiversioning. Multiverse features versioned and unversioned transactions which can execute concurrently. A main goal of Multiverse is to ensure that unversioned transactions achieve performance comparable to the state of the art unversioned STM while still supporting fast versioned transactions needed to enable long running reads. We implement Multiverse and compare it against several STMs. Our experiments demonstrate that Multiverse achieves comparable or better performance for common case workloads where there are no long running reads. For workloads with long running reads and frequent updates Multiverse significantly outperforms existing STMS. In several cases for these workloads the throughput of Multiverse is several orders of magnitude faster than other STMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper studies a heterogeneous distributed linearly separable computation problem, including one master and N distributed workers. The linearly separable task function involves Kc linear combinations of K messages, where each message is a function of one dataset. Distinguished from the existing homogeneous settings that assume each worker holds the same number of datasets, where the data assignment is carefully designed and controlled by the data center (e.g., the cyclic assignment), we consider a more general setting with arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment across workers, where `arbitrary' means that the data assignment is given in advance and `heterogeneous' means that the workers may hold different numbers of datasets. Our objective is to characterize the fundamental tradeoff between the computable dimension of the task function and the communication cost under arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment. Under the constraint of integer communication costs, for arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment, we propose a universal computing scheme and a universal converse bound by characterizing the structure of data assignment, where they coincide under some parameter regimes.

To support this behavior, we introduce a progressive perception strategy that decomposes decision-making into coarse exploration and fine-grained grounding, coordinated by a two-level policy. In addition, we design a spatially continuous reward function tailored to tool usage, which integrates both location proximity and region overlap to provide dense supervision and alleviate the reward sparsity common in GUI environments. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, GUI-Eyes-3B achieves 44.8% grounding accuracy using only 3k labeled samples, significantly outperforming both supervised and RL-based baselines. These results highlight that tool-aware active perception, enabled by staged policy reasoning and fine-grained reward feedback, is critical for building robust and data-efficient GUI agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While data ingestion and storage capabilities have matured significantly, enterprises continue to face systemic challenges in governing IoT data at scale. These challenges are not rooted in tooling limitations but in the absence of a governance model that aligns with the realities of distributed operational ownership, heterogeneous source systems, and continuous change at the edge. This paper presents a federated governance model that emphasizes contract-driven interoperability, policy-as-code enforcement, and asset-centric accountability across global manufacturing organizations. The model addresses governance enforcement at architectural boundaries, enabling semantic consistency, quality assurance, and regulatory compliance without requiring centralized control of operational technology systems.

We investigate whether multi-agent systems function as strategic reasoners capable of payoff optimization or as identity-driven actors that prioritize role alignment over explicit incentives. Using Nash equilibrium achievement as a diagnostic for strategic reasoning, we conduct systematic experiments across four LLM architectures (Qwen-7B, Qwen-32B, Llama-8B, Mistral-7B) in complex environmental decision-making games involving four agents. We show that role identity bias fundamentally alters strategic reasoning even when payoff-optimal equilibria exist and complete payoff information is available. Removing personas and providing explicit payoffs enables Qwen models to achieve high Nash equilibrium rates, indicating that both conditions are necessary for strategic reasoning. In contrast, personas systematically bias equilibrium selection toward socially preferred outcomes: with personas present, all of the achieved equilibria correspond to Green Transition, while models entirely fail to reach equilibrium when Tragedy of the Commons is payoff-optimal. The effect of explicit payoffs depends entirely on persona presence, revealing strong interactions between representational design choices. We also observe clear model-dependent patterns. Qwen architectures are highly sensitive to both personas and payoff visibility, whereas Llama and Mistral exhibit rigid reasoning behavior across conditions.

Most FD discovery algorithms find all valid dependencies, but this causes two problems. First, the computational cost is prohibitive: computational complexity grows quadratically with the number of tuples and exponentially with the number of attributes, making discovery slow on large-scale and high-dimensional data. Second, the result set can be huge, making it hard to identify useful dependencies. We propose SDP (Selective-Discovery-and-Prune), which discovers the top-$k$ FDs ranked by redundancy count. Redundancy count measures how much duplicated information an FD explains and connects directly to storage overhead and update anomalies. SDP uses an upper bound on redundancy to prune the search space. It is proved that this upper bound is monotone: adding attributes refines partitions and thus decreases the bound. Once the bound falls below the top-$k$ threshold, the entire branch can be skipped. We improve SDP with three optimizations: ordering attributes by partition cardinality, using pairwise statistics in a Partition Cardinality Matrix to tighten bounds, and a global scheduler to explore promising branches first. Experiments on over 40 datasets show that SDP is much faster and uses less memory than exhaustive methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Designed for decentralized execution to enhance adaptability and privacy, TopoDIM enables agents to autonomously construct heterogeneous communication without iterative coordination, achieving token efficiency and improved task performance.

We address this question in a two-phase online experiment (N = 491 Phase II participants; Phase I provided targets) where participants could spend part of their own endowment to reduce the earnings of peers who had previously completed a real-effort task with or without LLM support. On average, participants destroyed 36% of the earnings of those who relied exclusively on the model, with punishment increasing monotonically with actual LLM use. Disclosure about LLM use created a credibility gap: self-reported null use was punished more harshly than actual null use, suggesting that declarations of \"no use\" are treated with suspicion.

While interactive approaches introduce additional overhead, hybrid approaches depend on external components, which limit their scalability. A non-interactive, end-to-end framework enables reasoning to emerge within the model itself -- improving generalization while preserving analyzability without any external resources. In this work, we introduce a non-interactive, end-to-end framework for reasoning tasks. We show that introducing structural information into the few-shot prompt activates a subset of attention heads that patterns aligned with logical reasoning operators. Building on this insight, we propose Attention-Aware Intervention (AAI), an inference-time intervention method that reweights attention scores across selected heads identified by their logical patterns. AAI offers an efficient way to steer the model's reasoning toward leveraging prior knowledge through attention modulation. Extensive experiments show that AAI enhances logical reasoning performance across diverse benchmarks and model architectures, while incurring negligible additional computational overhead.

For this, LLMs can be extended with tools, which are often defined in advance, also allowing for some fine-tuning for specific use cases. However, rapidly evolving software landscapes and individual services require the constant development and integration of new tools. Domain- or company-specific tools can greatly elevate the usefulness of an LLM, but such custom tools can be problematic to integrate, or the LLM may fail to reliably understand and use them. For this, we need strategies to define new tools and integrate them into the LLM dynamically, as well as robust and scalable zero-shot prompting methods that can make use of those tools in an efficient manner. In this paper, we present SAGE, a specialized conversational AI interface, based on the OPACA framework for tool discovery and execution. The integration with OPACA makes it easy to add new tools or services for the LLM to use, while SAGE itself presents rich extensibility and modularity. This not only provides the ability to seamlessly switch between different models (e.g. GPT, LLAMA), but also to add and select prompting methods, involving various setups of differently prompted agents for selecting and executing tools and evaluating the results. We implemented a number of task-solving strategies, making use of agentic concepts and prompting methods in various degrees of complexity, and evaluated those against a comprehensive set of benchmark services. The results are promising and highlight the distinct strengths and weaknesses of different task-solving strategies.

Beyond improving model accuracy over a variety of reasoning tasks, our method is inherently efficient, as only the KV pairs of one additional induced thought are kept in the KV cache during reasoning.

Most existing approaches primarily optimize task performance and inference cost, and explicitly or implicitly assume sequential execution, making them less optimal for controlling latency under parallel execution. In this work, we investigate learning-based orchestration of multi-agent systems with explicit latency supervision under parallel execution. We propose Latency-Aware Multi-agent System (LAMaS), a latency-aware multi-agent orchestration framework that enables parallel execution and explicitly optimizes the critical execution path, allowing the controller to construct execution topology graphs with lower latency under parallel execution. Our experiments show that our approach reduces critical path length by 38-46% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline for multi-agent architecture search across multiple benchmarks, while maintaining or even improving task performance. These results highlight the importance of explicitly optimizing latency under parallel execution when designing efficient multi-agent systems.

Unlike earlier chatbots, LLM-based CAs routinely generate interactional and linguistic cues, such as first-person self-reference, epistemic and affective expressions that empirical work shows can increase engagement. On the other hand, anthropomorphisation raises ethical concerns, including deception, overreliance, and exploitative relationship framing, while some authors argue that anthropomorphic interaction may support autonomy, well-being, and inclusion. Despite increasing interest in the phenomenon, literature remains fragmented across domains and varies substantially in how it defines, operationalizes, and normatively evaluates anthropomorphisation. This scoping review maps ethically oriented work on anthropomorphising LLM-based CAs across five databases and three preprint repositories. We synthesize (1) conceptual foundations, (2) ethical challenges and opportunities, and (3) methodological approaches. We find convergence on attribution-based definitions but substantial divergence in operationalization, a predominantly risk-forward normative framing, and limited empirical work that links observed interaction effects to actionable governance guidance. We conclude with a research agenda and design/governance recommendations for ethically deploying anthropomorphic cues in LLM-based conversational agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automation, their susceptibility to hallucinations limits reliable application. Existing hybrid approaches mitigate this issue by constraining LLMs with formal models, but still rely on costly manual modeling. To solve this problem, this paper proposes RAFT, a framework for requirements auto-formalization and compliance test generation via explicating tacit regulatory knowledge from multiple LLMs. RAFT employs an Adaptive Purification-Aggregation strategy to explicate tacit regulatory knowledge from multiple LLMs and integrate it into three artifacts: a domain meta-model, a formal requirements representation, and testability constraints. These artifacts are then dynamically injected into prompts to guide high-precision requirement formalization and automated test generation. Experiments across financial, automotive, and power domains show that RAFT achieves expert-level performance, substantially outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while reducing overall generation and review time.", "AI": {"tldr": "RAFT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u591aLLM\u663e\u5316\u9690\u6027\u76d1\u7ba1\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u9700\u6c42\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6846\u67b6", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76d1\u7ba1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5408\u89c4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u9700\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u6cd5\u89c4\u8f6c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7ea6\u675fLLM\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u4f9d\u8d56\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRAFT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u51c0\u5316-\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4ece\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u4e2d\u663e\u5316\u9690\u6027\u76d1\u7ba1\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e09\u4e2a\u5de5\u4ef6\uff1a\u9886\u57df\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u8868\u793a\u548c\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u4ef6\u88ab\u52a8\u6001\u6ce8\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u6307\u5bfc\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9700\u6c42\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u6c7d\u8f66\u548c\u7535\u529b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRAFT\u8fbe\u5230\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u603b\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5ba1\u9605\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "RAFT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u591aLLM\u7684\u9690\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u663e\u5316\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76d1\u7ba1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5408\u89c4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although many definitions of fairness exist, we focus on path-specific causal fairness, which allows us to better consider the social and medical contexts in which biases occur (e.g., direct discrimination by a clinician or model versus bias due to differential access to the healthcare system) and to characterize how these biases may appear in learned models. In this work, we map the structural fairness model to the observational healthcare setting and create a generalizable pipeline for training causally fair models. The pipeline explicitly considers specific healthcare context and disparities to define a target \"fair\" model. Our work fills two major gaps: first, we expand on characterizations of the \"fairness-accuracy\" tradeoff by detangling direct and indirect sources of bias and jointly presenting these fairness considerations alongside considerations of accuracy in the context of broadly known biases. Second, we demonstrate how a foundation model trained without fairness constraints on observational health data can be leveraged to generate causally fair downstream predictions in tasks with known social and medical disparities. This work presents a model-agnostic pipeline for training causally fair machine learning models that address both direct and indirect forms of healthcare bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, evidence in psychology, economics, and Rawlsian theory suggests that fairness is also about process and who gets a say in the decisions being made. We introduce a new fairness objective, procedural fairness, which provides equal decision-making power for all agents, lies in the core, and provides for proportionality in outcomes. Empirical results confirm that fairness notions based on optimizing for outcomes sacrifice equal voice and representation, while the sacrifice in outcome-based fairness objectives (like equality and utilitarianism) is minimal under procedurally fair policies. We further prove that different fairness notions prioritize fundamentally different and incompatible values, highlighting that fairness requires explicit normative choices.

Since its introduction in the human-AI interaction literature, it has gained traction by generalizing the reliance paradigm and by offering a more practical alternative to the contested construct of 'trust in AI.' Yet complementarity faces key theoretical challenges: it lacks precise theoretical anchoring, it is formalized just as a post hoc indicator of relative predictive accuracy, it remains silent about other desiderata of human-AI interactions and it abstracts away from the magnitude-cost profile of its performance gain. As a result, complementarity is difficult to obtain in empirical settings. In this work, we leverage epistemology to address these challenges by reframing complementarity within the discourse on justificatory AI. Drawing on computational reliabilism, we argue that historical instances of complementarity function as evidence that a given human-AI interaction is a reliable epistemic process for a given predictive task. Together with other reliability indicators assessing the alignment of the human-AI team with the epistemic standards and socio-technical practices, complementarity contributes to the degree of reliability of human-AI teams when generating predictions. This supports the practical reasoning of those affected by these outputs -- patients, managers, regulators, and others. In summary, our approach suggests that the role and value of complementarity lies not in providing a relative measure of predictive accuracy, but in helping calibrate decision-making to the reliability of AI-supported processes that increasingly shape everyday life.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose an integrated framework combining GPTQ-based quantization, low-rank adaptation (LoRA), and a specialized data distillation process to significantly reduce model size and complexity while preserving or enhancing task-specific performance. By leveraging data distillation, knowledge distillation via Kullback-Leibler divergence, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and the Muon optimizer, our pipeline achieves up to 2x memory compression (e.g., reducing a 6GB model to 3GB) and enables efficient inference for specialized tasks.

Such workflow-driven designs are essentially rule-based decision trees, which suffer from two fundamental limitations: they require substantial manual effort to anticipate and encode possible task states, and they cannot exhaustively cover the state space of complex real-world tasks. To address these issues, we propose an Information-Flow-Orchestrated Multi-Agent Paradigm via Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication from CORAL, in which a dedicated information flow orchestrator continuously monitors task progress and dynamically coordinates other agents through the A2A toolkit using natural language, without relying on predefined workflows. We evaluate our approach on the general-purpose benchmark GAIA, using the representative workflow-based MAS OWL as the baseline while controlling for agent roles and underlying models. Under the pass@1 setting, our method achieves 63.64% accuracy, outperforming OWL's 55.15% by 8.49 percentage points with comparable token consumption. Further case-level analysis shows that our paradigm enables more flexible task monitoring and more robust handling of edge cases.

Additionally, we study a subset of active repositories on a monthly basis to track changes in adherence to coding standards over time. We found widespread violations across repositories, with Javadoc and Naming violations being the most common. We also found a significant number of violations of the GOOGLE Java Style Guide in categories often missed by modern static analysis tools. Furthermore, repositories claiming to follow code-style practices exhibited slightly higher overall adherence to code-style and best-practices. The results provide valuable insights into the adoption of code style and programming practices, highlighting key areas for improvement in the open-source development community.

Existing proactive agents attempt to address this gap either by eliciting further clarification, preserving this burden, or by extrapolating future needs from context, often leading to unnecessary or mistimed interventions. We introduce ProPer, Proactivity-driven Personalized agents, a novel two-agent architecture consisting of a Dimension Generating Agent (DGA) and a Response Generating Agent (RGA). DGA, a fine-tuned LLM agent, leverages explicit user data to generate multiple implicit dimensions (latent aspects relevant to the user's task but not considered by the user) or knowledge gaps. These dimensions are selectively filtered using a reranker based on quality, diversity, and task relevance. RGA then balances explicit and implicit dimensions to tailor personalized responses with timely and proactive interventions. We evaluate ProPer across multiple domains using a structured, gap-aware rubric that measures coverage, initiative appropriateness, and intent alignment. Our results show that ProPer improves quality scores and win rates across all domains, achieving up to 84% gains in single-turn evaluation and consistent dominance in multi-turn interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Stage I : Prototype generation: a multi-agent reasoner performs retrieval-anchored, fragment-level edits to produce a candidate near the feasible region. Stage II : RL-based fine-grained optimization: a fragment-level optimizer trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) applies one- or multi-hop refinements to explicitly minimize the property errors toward our target while regulating edit complexity and deviation from the prototype. A large, automatically curated dataset with reasoning chains of fragment edits and measured property deltas underpins both stages, enabling deterministic, reproducible supervision and controllable multi-hop reasoning. Unlike prior work, our framework better reasons about molecules by leveraging fragments and supports controllable refinement toward numeric targets.

Rather than disclosing implementation specifics, we specify the architectural requirements CMA imposes and show consistent behavioral advantages on tasks that expose RAG's structural inability to accumulate, mutate, or disambiguate memory.

We also conducted an interview study with 15 former students of the course and 14 experienced educators from around the globe.

The only known robust defense is architectural isolation that strictly separates trusted task planning from untrusted environment observations. However, applying this design to Computer Use Agents (CUAs) -- systems that automate tasks by viewing screens and executing actions -- presents a fundamental challenge: current agents require continuous observation of UI state to determine each action, conflicting with the isolation required for security. We resolve this tension by demonstrating that UI workflows, while dynamic, are structurally predictable. We introduce Single-Shot Planning for CUAs, where a trusted planner generates a complete execution graph with conditional branches before any observation of potentially malicious content, providing provable control flow integrity guarantees against arbitrary instruction injections. Although this architectural isolation successfully prevents instruction injections, we show that additional measures are needed to prevent Branch Steering attacks, which manipulate UI elements to trigger unintended valid paths within the plan. We evaluate our design on OSWorld, and retain up to 57% of the performance of frontier models while improving performance for smaller open-source models by up to 19%, demonstrating that rigorous security and utility can coexist in CUAs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities for supporting various software engineering activities, but their use for detecting code smells remains underexplored. However, unlike the rigid rules of static analysis tools, LLMs can support flexible and adaptable detection strategies tailored to the unique properties of code smells. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of four LLMs -- DeepSeek-R1, GPT-5 mini, Llama-3.3, and Qwen2.5-Code -- for detecting nine code smells across 30 Java projects. For the empirical evaluation, we created a ground-truth dataset by asking 76 developers to manually inspect 268 code-smell candidates. Our results indicate that LLMs perform strongly for structurally straightforward smells, such as Large Class and Long Method. However, we also observed that different LLMs and tools fare better for distinct code smells. We then propose and evaluate a detection strategy that combines LLMs and static analysis tools. The proposed strategy outperforms LLMs and tools in five out of nine code smells in terms of F1-Score. However, it also generates more false positives for complex smells. Therefore, we conclude that the optimal strategy depends on whether Recall or Precision is the main priority for code smell detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce Kinematic Tokenization, an optimization-based continuous-time representation that reconstructs an explicit spline from noisy measurements and tokenizes local spline coefficients (position, velocity, acceleration, jerk). This is applied to financial time series data in the form of asset prices in conjunction with trading volume profiles. Across a multi-asset daily-equity testbed, we use a risk-averse asymmetric classification objective as a stress test for learnability. Under this objective, several discrete baselines collapse to an absorbing cash policy (the Liquidation Equilibrium), whereas the continuous spline tokens sustain calibrated, non-trivial action distributions and stable policies.

We present a simple, generalizable two-stage workflow: an LLM applies a human-designed, LLM-adapted codebook; a secondary LLM critic performs self-reflection on each positive label by re-reading the source text alongside the first model's rationale and issuing a final decision. We evaluate this approach on six qualitative codes over 3,000 high-content emails from Apache Software Foundation project evaluation discussions. Our human-derived audit of 360 positive annotations (60 passages by six codes) found that the first-line LLM had a false-positive rate of 8% to 54%, despite F1 scores of 0.74 and 1.00 in testing. Subsequent recoding of all stage-one annotations via a second self-reflection stage improved F1 by 0.04 to 0.25, bringing two especially poor performing codes up to 0.69 and 0.79 from 0.52 and 0.55 respectively. Our manual evaluation identified two recurrent error classes: misinterpretation (violations of code definitions) and meta-discussion (debate about a project evaluation criterion mistaken for its use as a decision justification). Code-specific critic clauses addressing observed failure modes were especially effective with testing and refinement, replicating the codebook-adaption process for LLM interpretation in stage-one.

We show, by analyzing seventy-three public data deals, that the majority of value accrues to aggregators, with documented creator royalties rounding to zero and widespread opacity of deal terms. This is not just an economic welfare concern: as data and its derivatives become economic assets, the feedback loop that sustains current learning algorithms is at risk.

However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) hybrid testing tools do not fully exploit the capabilities of symbolic execution and sampling in two key aspects. First, the SOTA hybrid testing tools employ tailored symbolic execution engines that tend to over-prune branches, leading to considerable time wasted waiting for seeds from the fuzzer and missing opportunities to discover crashes. Second, existing methods do not apply sampling to the appropriate branches and therefore cannot utilize the full capability of sampling. To address these two limitations, we propose a novel hybrid testing architecture that combines the precision of conventional symbolic execution with the scalability of tailored symbolic execution engines. Based on this architecture, we propose several principles for combining fuzzing, symbolic execution, and sampling. We implement our method in a hybrid testing tool S$^2$F. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on 15 real-world programs. Experimental results demonstrate that S$^2$F outperforms the SOTA tool, achieving an average improvement of 6.14% in edge coverage and 32.6% in discovered crashes. Notably, our tool uncovers three previously unknown crashes in real-world programs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, real-world interactions are dynamic, where user interests continuously evolve, posing a challenge for models to adapt to preference drift without catastrophic forgetting. Standard continual learning approaches often struggle in this context, as they indiscriminately update on noisy interaction streams, failing to distinguish genuine preference shifts from transient contexts. To address this, we introduce SPRInG, a novel semi-parametric framework designed for effective continual personalization. During training, SPRInG employs drift-driven selective adaptation, which utilizes a likelihood-based scoring function to identify high-novelty interactions. This allows the model to selectively update the user-specific adapter on drift signals while preserving hard-to-learn residuals in a replay buffer. During inference, we apply strict relevance gating and fuse parametric knowledge with retrieved history via logit interpolation. Experiments on the long-form personalized generation benchmark demonstrate that SPRInG outperforms existing baselines, validating its robustness for real-world continual personalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Instead of leaving decomposition to chance, we apply three clear strategies, entity-wise, hierarchical, and atomic sequential, to encourage diverse reasoning. For correction, we build a dynamic memory of both successful queries and historical error-fix pairs, and use retrieval-augmented prompting to bring relevant examples into context at inference time, no fine-tuning or external APIs required.

Modern ANNS engines accelerate this process using prebuilt indexes and store compressed vector-quantized representations in fast memory. However, they still rely on a costly second-pass refinement stage that reads full-precision vectors from slower storage like SSDs. For modern text and multimodal embeddings, these reads now dominate the latency of the entire query. We propose FaTRQ, a far-memory-aware refinement system using tiered memory that eliminates the need to fetch full vectors from storage. It introduces a progressive distance estimator that refines coarse scores using compact residuals streamed from far memory. Refinement stops early once a candidate is provably outside the top-k. To support this, we propose tiered residual quantization, which encodes residuals as ternary values stored efficiently in far memory. A custom accelerator is deployed in a CXL Type-2 device to perform low-latency refinement locally.

To address this challenge, researchers are increasingly utilizing Machine Learning approaches to identify malware through behavioral (i.e. dynamic) cues. However, current approaches are limited by their reliance on large labeled datasets, fixed model training, and the assumption that a trained model remains effective over time-disregarding the ever-evolving sophistication of malware. As a result, they often fail to detect evolving malware attacks that adapt over time. This paper proposes an online learning approach for dynamic malware detection, that overcomes these limitations by incorporating temporal information to continuously update its models using behavioral features, specifically process resource utilization metrics. By doing so, the proposed models can incrementally adapt to emerging threats and detect zero-day malware effectively. Upon evaluating our approach against traditional batch algorithms, we find it effective in detecting zero-day malware. Moreover, we demonstrate its efficacy in scenarios with limited data availability, where traditional batch-based approaches often struggle to perform reliably.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Unlike standard transformers that process representations through fixed discrete layers, our approach treats depth as a continuous variable governed by a learned vector field $F_\u03b8(H, \u03c4, u)$, where $u$ is a low-dimensional control signal injected via explicit concatenation. We validate the architecture through four experiments: (1) gradient flow stability with zero exploding/vanishing gradient events, (2) semantic steering achieving 98\\%/88\\% accuracy for positive/negative sentiment control, (3) continuous interpolation validated by a negligible 0.068\\% trajectory divergence between fixed and adaptive solvers, and (4) efficiency benchmarking demonstrating latency parity with standard discrete baselines. Additionally, we show that adaptive ODE solvers reveal geometric structure in the learned dynamics: the control signal partitions the vector field into distinct dynamical regimes with different curvature characteristics. The adjoint method enables $O(1)$ memory training regardless of integration depth. Our results demonstrate that continuous-depth dynamics with learned control signals provide a viable, efficient mechanism for steerable language generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u795e\u7ecfODE\u6a21\u5757\u66ff\u6362\u79bb\u6563\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6transformer\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u79bb\u6563\u5c42\u5904\u7406\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u8fde\u7eed\u6df1\u5ea6\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efahybrid transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u795e\u7ecfODE\u6a21\u5757\u66ff\u6362\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\uff0c\u7531\u5411\u91cf\u573aF_\u03b8(H, \u03c4, u)\u63a7\u5236\u6df1\u5ea6\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0cu\u4e3a\u4f4e\u7ef4\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u8fc7\u62fc\u63a5\u6ce8\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a(1)\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u7a33\u5b9a\u65e0\u7206\u70b8/\u6d88\u5931\uff1b(2)\u60c5\u611f\u63a7\u5236\u51c6\u786e\u738798%/88%\uff1b(3)\u63d2\u503c\u8f68\u8ff9\u5dee\u5f02\u4ec50.068%\uff1b(4)\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u793a\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u4e2d\u5212\u5206\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u66f2\u7387\u7279\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e26\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6df1\u5ea6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e3a\u53ef\u5f15\u5bfc\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f34\u968f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u79ef\u5206\u6df1\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u7684O(1)\u5185\u5b58\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

Similar to how version control systems once automated manual coordination, AI tools are now beginning to automate many aspects of programming. For embedded software engineering organizations, however, this marks their first experience integrating AI into safety-critical and resource-constrained environments. The strict demands for determinism, reliability, and traceability pose unique challenges for adopting generative technologies.\n  In this paper, we present findings from a qualitative study with ten senior experts from four companies who are evaluating generative AI-augmented development for embedded software. Through semi-structured focus group interviews and structured brainstorming sessions, we identified eleven emerging practices and fourteen challenges related to the orchestration, responsible governance, and sustainable adoption of generative AI tools. Our results show how embedded software engineering teams are rethinking workflows, roles, and toolchains to enable a sustainable transition toward agentic pipelines and generative AI-augmented development.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Standard multimodal pipelines learn a single shared embedding across all modalities. In DFL, such a monolithic representation induces gradient misalignment between uni- and multimodal agents; as a result, it suppresses heterogeneous sharing and cross-modal interaction. We present PARSE, a multimodal DFL framework that operationalizes partial information decomposition (PID) in a server-free setting. Each agent performs feature fission to factorize its latent representation into redundant, unique, and synergistic slices. P2P knowledge sharing among heterogeneous agents is enabled by slice-level partial alignment: only semantically shareable branches are exchanged among agents that possess the corresponding modality. By removing the need for central coordination and gradient surgery, PARSE resolves uni-/multimodal gradient conflicts, thereby overcoming the multimodal DFL dilemma while remaining compatible with standard DFL constraints. Across benchmarks and agent mixes, PARSE yields consistent gains over task-, modality-, and hybrid-sharing DFL baselines. Ablations on fusion operators and split ratios, together with qualitative visualizations, further demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed design.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Traditional numerical methods exhibit several inherent limitations, prompting Deep Learning (DL) as a promising alternative. The effectiveness of current DL techniques typically depends on the availability of high-quantity and high-accuracy datasets, which are yet difficult to obtain in large deformation problems. During the dataset construction process, a dilemma stands between data quantity and data accuracy, leading to suboptimal performance in the DL models. To address this challenge, we focus on a representative application of large deformations, the stretch bending problem, and propose FilDeep, a Fidelity-based Deep Learning framework for large Deformation of elastic-plastic solids. Our FilDeep aims to resolve the quantity-accuracy dilemma by simultaneously training with both low-fidelity and high-fidelity data, where the former provides greater quantity but lower accuracy, while the latter offers higher accuracy but in less quantity. In FilDeep, we provide meticulous designs for the practical large deformation problem. Particularly, we propose attention-enabled cross-fidelity modules to effectively capture long-range physical interactions across MF data. To the best of our knowledge, our FilDeep presents the first DL framework for large deformation problems using MF data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FilDeep consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance and can be efficiently deployed in manufacturing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa FilDeep\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5f39\u6027\u5851\u6027\u56fa\u4f53\u5927\u53d8\u5f62\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff08\u5927\u91cf\u4f46\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\uff09\u548c\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff08\u5c11\u91cf\u4f46\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff09\u6570\u636e\u6765\u514b\u670d\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e24\u96be\u56f0\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u53d8\u5f62\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e24\u96be\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6b20\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5178\u578b\u5927\u53d8\u5f62\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u62c9\u4f38\u5f2f\u66f2\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa FilDeep \u6846\u67b6\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\uff08\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\uff09\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8de8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u95f4\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u7269\u7406\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFilDeep \u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u5728\u5236\u9020\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "FilDeep \u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u4e3a\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5927\u53d8\u5f62\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u91cf-\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e24\u96be\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5236\u9020\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u53d8\u5f62\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In our empirical study, we observe substantial adoption of open-weight models, the outsized popularity of creative roleplay (beyond just the productivity tasks many assume dominate) and coding assistance categories, plus the rise of agentic inference. Furthermore, our retention analysis identifies foundational cohorts: early users whose engagement persists far longer than later cohorts. We term this phenomenon the Cinderella \"Glass Slipper\" effect. These findings underscore that the way developers and end-users engage with LLMs \"in the wild\" is complex and multifaceted. We discuss implications for model builders, AI developers, and infrastructure providers, and outline how a data-driven understanding of usage can inform better design and deployment of LLM systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8eOpenRouter\u5e73\u53f0\u5bf9\u8d85\u8fc7100\u4e07\u4ebftoken\u7684\u5b9e\u9645LLM\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\uff0c\u521b\u610f\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u8f85\u52a9\u7c7b\u5e94\u7528\u5f02\u5e38\u6d41\u884c\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u5174\u8d77\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u65e9\u671f\u7528\u6237\u7684\u957f\u671f\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684'\u73bb\u7483\u978b'\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u9996\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578bo1\u7684\u53d1\u5e03\uff0cLLM\u9886\u57df\u4ece\u5355\u6b21\u6a21\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u8f6c\u5411\u591a\u6b65\u5ba1\u614e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u6ede\u540e\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684LLM\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u77e5\u8bc6\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528OpenRouter\u5e73\u53f0\u4f5c\u4e3aAI\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8d85\u8fc7100\u4e07\u4ebftoken\u7684LLM\u5b9e\u9645\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u5927\u91cf\u91c7\u7528\uff0c\u521b\u610f\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u8f85\u52a9\u7c7b\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u5f02\u5e38\u6d41\u884c\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u5174\u8d77\u3002\u7559\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u4f53\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u8fdc\u9ad8\u4e8e\u540e\u671f\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a'\u73bb\u7483\u978b'\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u548c\u7ec8\u7aef\u7528\u6237\u4e0eLLM\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u5f0f\u590d\u6742\u591a\u5143\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u7406\u89e3\u53ef\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u8005\u3001AI\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u6d1e\u89c1\u3002"}}

Exposure-Aware Evaluation of Bug-vs-Fix Preference in Code LLMs", "comment": "MSR 2026 Technical Track", "summary": "Large language models are increasingly used for code generation and debugging, but their outputs can still contain bugs, that originate from training data. Distinguishing whether an LLM prefers correct code, or a familiar incorrect version might be influenced by what it's been exposed to during training. We introduce an exposure-aware evaluation framework that quantifies how prior exposure to buggy versus fixed code influences a model's preference. Using the ManySStuBs4J benchmark, we apply Data Portraits for membership testing on the Stack-V2 corpus to estimate whether each buggy and fixed variant was seen during training. We then stratify examples by exposure and compare model preference using code completion as well as multiple likelihood-based scoring metrics We find that most examples (67%) have neither variant in the training data, and when only one is present, fixes are more frequently present than bugs. In model generations, models reproduce buggy lines far more often than fixes, with bug-exposed examples amplifying this tendency and fix-exposed examples showing only marginal improvement. In likelihood scoring, minimum and maximum token-probability metrics consistently prefer the fixed code across all conditions, indicating a stable bias toward correct fixes. In contrast, metrics like the Gini coefficient reverse preference when only the buggy variant was seen. Our results indicate that exposure can skew bug-fix evaluations and highlight the risk that LLMs may propagate memorised errors in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Accepted at The Web Conference (WWW) 2026", "summary": "As knowledge and semantics on the web grow increasingly complex, enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) comprehension and reasoning capabilities has become particularly important. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, it still falls short on logical reasoning tasks that rely on symbolic expressions and strict deductive rules. Neuro-symbolic methods address this gap by enforcing formal correctness through external solvers. Yet these solvers are highly format-sensitive, and small instabilities in model outputs can lead to frequent processing failures. LLM-driven approaches avoid parsing brittleness, but they lack structured representations and process-level error-correction mechanisms. To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we propose MatrixCoT, a structured CoT framework with a matrix-based plan. Specifically, we normalize and type natural language expressions, attach explicit citation fields, and introduce a matrix-based planning method to preserve global relations among steps. The plan becomes a verifiable artifact, making execution more stable. For verification, we also add a feedback-driven replanning mechanism. Under semantic-equivalence constraints, it identifies omissions and defects, rewrites and compresses the dependency matrix, and produces a more trustworthy final answer. Experiments on five logical-reasoning benchmarks and five LLMs show that, without relying on external solvers, MatrixCoT enhances both robustness and interpretability when tackling complex symbolic reasoning tasks, while maintaining competitive performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The modular framework enables adaptation of any model and supports community contributions. We demonstrate the utility of the platform in a clinical use case through comparative evaluation of lung segmentation models. To further strengthen transparency and reproducibility, we publicly release the generated segmentations and evaluation metrics and provide interactive dashboards that allow readers to inspect individual cases and reproduce or extend our analysis.

Traditional static ensemble methods, such as Stacking, typically assign weights by treating each base learner as a holistic entity, thereby overlooking the fact that individual models exhibit varying degrees of competence across different regions of the instance space. To address this limitation, Dynamic Ensemble Selection (DES) was introduced. However, both static and dynamic approaches predominantly rely on the divergence among different models as the basis for integration. This inter-model perspective neglects the intrinsic characteristics of the models themselves and necessitates a heavy reliance on validation sets for competence estimation. In this paper, we propose the Behavioral Profiling Ensemble (BPE) framework, which introduces a novel paradigm shift. Unlike traditional methods, BPE constructs a ``behavioral profile'' intrinsic to each model and derives integration weights based on the deviation between the model's response to a specific test instance and its established behavioral profile. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the algorithm derived from the BPE framework achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art ensemble baselines.

While distilling a fine-tuned LLM into a smaller student model is a promising alternative, the capacity gap between teacher and student often leads to suboptimal performance. This raises a key question: when and how can a student model match or even surpass its teacher on domain-specific tasks? In this work, we propose a novel theoretical insight: a student can outperform its teacher if its advantage on a Student-Favored Subdomain (SFS) outweighs its deficit on the Teacher-Favored Subdomain (TFS). Guided by this insight, we propose Scheduled Checkpoint Distillation (SCD), which reduces the TFS deficit by emulating the teacher's convergence process during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the domain task, and a sample-wise Adaptive Weighting (AW) mechanism to preserve student strengths on SFS. Experiments across diverse domain tasks--including QA, NER, and text classification in multiple languages--show that our method consistently outperforms existing distillation approaches, allowing the student model to match or even exceed the performance of its fine-tuned teacher.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Meanwhile, there exist vast and continuously growing amounts of unlabeled data that may be closely related to the ICL task. How to utilize such unlabeled data to provably enhance the performance of ICL thus becomes an emerging fundamental question. In this work, we propose a novel augmented ICL framework, in which the prompt includes a small set of labeled examples alongside a block of unlabeled inputs. We focus on the multi-class linear classification setting and demonstrate that, with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, a multi-layer transformer can effectively emulate an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. This enables the transformer to implicitly extract useful information from both labeled and unlabeled data, leading to provable improvements in ICL accuracy. Moreover, we show that such a transformer can be trained via teacher forcing, with its parameters converging to the desired solution at a linear rate. Experiments demonstrate that the augmented ICL framework consistently outperforms conventional few-shot ICL, providing empirical support for our theoretical findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study on the impact of unlabeled data on the ICL performance of transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, ensuring the effectiveness of CRSs requires large-scale and even continuous model training to accommodate diverse user preferences, resulting in significant computational costs and resource demands. A promising approach to this challenge is coreset selection, which identifies a small but representative subset of data samples that preserves model quality while reducing training overhead. Yet, the selected coreset is vulnerable to the pervasive noise in user-item interactions, particularly when it is minimally sized. To this end, we propose Noise-aware Coreset Selection (NaCS), a specialized framework for CRSs. NaCS constructs coresets through submodular optimization based on training gradients, while simultaneously correcting noisy labels using a progressively trained model. Meanwhile, we refine the selected coreset by filtering out low-confidence samples through uncertainty quantification, thereby avoid training with unreliable interactions. Through extensive experiments, we show that NaCS produces higher-quality coresets for CRSs while achieving better efficiency than existing coreset selection techniques. Notably, NaCS recovers 93-95\\% of full-dataset training performance using merely 1\\% of the training data.

Yet, their ability to infer temporal regularities from structured behavioral data remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic study investigating whether LLMs can predict time intervals between recurring user actions, such as repeated purchases, and how different levels of contextual information shape their predictive behavior. Using a simple but representative repurchase scenario, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs in zero-shot settings against both statistical and machine-learning models. Two key findings emerge. First, while LLMs surpass lightweight statistical baselines, they consistently underperform dedicated machine-learning models, showing their limited ability to capture quantitative temporal structure. Second, although moderate context can improve LLM accuracy, adding further user-level detail degrades performance. These results challenge the assumption that \"more context leads to better reasoning\".

This study presents a comparative biomedical artificial intelligence framework evaluating an image-based deep learning model (HuSHeM) alongside a clinically grounded baseline derived from World Health Organization criteria augmented with the Systemic Inflammation Response Index (WHO(+SIRI)).\n  The HuSHeM model was trained on high-resolution sperm morphology images and evaluated using an independent clinical cohort. Model performance was assessed using discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility analyses. The HuSHeM model demonstrated higher discriminative performance, as reflected by an increased area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with relatively narrow confidence intervals compared to WHO(+SIRI). Precision-recall analysis further indicated improved performance under class imbalance, with higher precision-recall area values across evaluated thresholds.

However, the substantial memory overhead of storing Key-Value (KV) caches during long-horizon rollouts acts as a critical bottleneck, often prohibiting efficient training on limited hardware. While existing KV compression techniques offer a remedy for inference, directly applying them to RL training induces a severe policy mismatch, leading to catastrophic performance collapse. To address this, we introduce Sparse-RL empowers stable RL training under sparse rollouts. We show that instability arises from a fundamental policy mismatch among the dense old policy, the sparse sampler policy, and the learner policy. To mitigate this issue, Sparse-RL incorporates Sparsity-Aware Rejection Sampling and Importance-based Reweighting to correct the off-policy bias introduced by compression-induced information loss. Experimental results show that Sparse-RL reduces rollout overhead compared to dense baselines while preserving the performance. Furthermore, Sparse-RL inherently implements sparsity-aware training, significantly enhancing model robustness during sparse inference deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The Decision Transformer (DT) introduced a powerful paradigm by framing RL as an autoregressive sequence modeling problem. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning and planning tasks. This inspires us whether LLMs, which share the same Transformer foundation, but operate at a much larger scale, can unlock new levels of performance in long-horizon sequential decision-making problem. This work investigates the application of LLMs to offline decision making tasks. A fundamental challenge in this domain is the LLMs' inherent inability to interpret continuous values, as they lack a native understanding of numerical magnitude and order when values are represented as text strings. To address this, we propose treating trajectories as a distinct modality. By learning to align trajectory data with natural language task descriptions, our model can autoregressively predict future decisions within a cohesive framework we term DecisionLLM. We establish a set of scaling laws governing this paradigm, demonstrating that performance hinges on three factors: model scale, data volume, and data quality. In offline experimental benchmarks and bidding scenarios, DecisionLLM achieves strong performance. Specifically, DecisionLLM-3B outperforms the traditional Decision Transformer (DT) by 69.4 on Maze2D umaze-v1 and by 0.085 on AuctionNet.

To address this limitation, we propose MMPG, a framework that constructs protein graphs from multiple perspectives and adaptively fuses them via Mixture of Experts (MoE) for PRL. MMPG constructs graphs from physical, chemical, and geometric perspectives to characterize different properties of residue interactions. To capture both perspective-specific features and their synergies, we develop an MoE module, which dynamically routes perspectives to specialized experts, where experts learn intrinsic features and cross-perspective interactions. We quantitatively verify that MoE automatically specializes experts in modeling distinct levels of interaction from individual representations, to pairwise inter-perspective synergies, and ultimately to a global consensus across all perspectives. Through integrating this multi-level information, MMPG produces superior protein representations and achieves advanced performance on four different downstream protein tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Each level refers to a representation extracted from a different layer of the encoder. LeMoF explicitly separates and learns global modality-level predictions from level-specific discriminative representations. This design enables LeMoF to achieve a balanced performance between prediction stability and discriminative capability even in heterogeneous clinical environments. Experiments on length of stay prediction using Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data demonstrate that LeMoF consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multimodal fusion techniques across various encoder configurations.

Initial Draft of Camera-ready", "summary": "Multimodal models excel in English, supported by abundant image-text and audio-text data, but performance drops sharply for other languages due to limited multilingual multimodal resources. Existing solutions rely heavily on machine translation, while advances in multilingual text modeling remain underutilized. We introduce METAL, a lightweight alignment method that learns only a few linear layers using English text alone to map multilingual text embeddings into a multimodal space. Despite its simplicity, METAL matches baseline performance in English (94.9 percent Recall at 10) and achieves strong zero-shot transfer (89.5 percent Recall at 10 averaged across 11 languages, 10 unseen) on XTD text-to-image retrieval. Qualitative t-SNE visualizations show that multilingual embeddings align tightly with multimodal representations, while weight analysis reveals that the transformation reshapes embedding geometry rather than performing trivial rotations. Beyond image-text retrieval, METAL generalizes to audio-text retrieval and cross-lingual text-to-image generation.

Downsampling offers a potential solution, but its impact on diagnostic signal content and classification performance remains insufficiently understood. This study presents a workflow for systematically evaluating information loss caused by downsampling in high-frequency time series. The workflow combines shape-based distortion metrics with classification outcomes from available feature-based machine learning models and feature space analysis to quantify how different downsampling algorithms and factors affect both waveform integrity and predictive performance. We use a three-class NMD classification task to experimentally evaluate the workflow. We demonstrate how the workflow identifies downsampling configurations that preserve diagnostic information while substantially reducing computational load. Analysis of shape-based distortion metrics showed that shape-aware downsampling algorithms outperform standard decimation, as they better preserve peak structure and overall signal morphology. The results provide practical guidance for selecting downsampling configurations that enable near real-time nEMG analysis and highlight a generalisable workflow that can be used to balance data reduction with model performance in other high-frequency time-series applications as well.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u9488\u6781\u808c\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u9ad8\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u6001\u5931\u771f\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u6781\u808c\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u9ad8\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7ed9\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5e26\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u662f\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u9020\u6210\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u5f62\u6001\u5931\u771f\u5ea6\u91cf\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u7c7b\u795e\u7ecf\u808c\u8089\u75be\u75c5\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5f62\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u5cf0\u503c\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f62\u6001\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u62bd\u53d6\uff1b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e3a\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u9488\u6781\u808c\u7535\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u914d\u7f6e\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u9ad8\u9891\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u7f29\u51cf\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Theoretical guarantees are provided for asymptotic identifiability of four pairwise relations. On data-free benchmarks derived from Mooij et al. and UCI causal graphs, Tree-Query improves structural metrics over direct LLM baselines, and a diet--weight case study illustrates confounder screening and stable, high-confidence causal conclusions. Tree-Query thus offers a principled way to obtain data-free causal priors from LLMs that can complement downstream data-driven causal discovery.

Motivated by the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, graph foundation models (GFMs) is proposed to handle few-shot learning task with fewer labeling efforts. GFMs have been successfully applied to detection of individual anomalies but cannot be generalized to group anomalies, as group anomaly patterns must be detected as a whole and individuals in an abnormal group can look rather normal. Therefore, we propose GFM4GA, a novel graph foundation model for group anomaly detection. The pipeline is pretrained via dual-level contrastive learning based on feature-based estimation and group extraction, to capture potential group anomaly structure and feature inconsistencies. In the downstream tasks, the pipeline is finetuned in parameter-constrained and group-anomaly-proportion weighted few-shot settings, and its adaptive ability to unseen group anomalies expanded via group contexts determined by labeled anomaly neighbors.

However, it has the potential to substantially degrade safety alignment, e.g., by greatly increasing susceptibility to jailbreak attacks, even when the fine-tuning data is entirely harmless. Despite garnering growing attention in defense efforts during the fine-tuning stage, existing methods struggle with a persistent safety-utility dilemma: emphasizing safety compromises task performance, whereas prioritizing utility typically requires deep fine-tuning that inevitably leads to steep safety declination.\n  In this work, we address this dilemma by shedding new light on the geometric interaction between safety- and utility-oriented gradients in safety-aligned LLMs. Through systematic empirical analysis, we uncover three key insights: (I) safety gradients lie in a low-rank subspace, while utility gradients span a broader high-dimensional space; (II) these subspaces are often negatively correlated, causing directional conflicts during fine-tuning; and (III) the dominant safety direction can be efficiently estimated from a single sample. Building upon these novel insights, we propose safety-preserving fine-tuning (SPF), a lightweight approach that explicitly removes gradient components conflicting with the low-rank safety subspace. Theoretically, we show that SPF guarantees utility convergence while bounding safety drift. Empirically, SPF consistently maintains downstream task performance and recovers nearly all pre-trained safety alignment, even under adversarial fine-tuning scenarios. Furthermore, SPF exhibits robust resistance to both deep fine-tuning and dynamic jailbreak attacks. Together, our findings provide new mechanistic understanding and practical guidance toward always-aligned LLM fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u62a4\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SPF\uff09\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u5c42\u9762\u4e0a\u5206\u79bb\u5e76\u4fdd\u62a4\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5b89\u5168\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c1d\u8bd5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u5b89\u5168-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u56f0\u5883\uff1a\u5f3a\u8c03\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u6548\u7528\u5219\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u5bb3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5927\u5927\u589e\u52a0\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u5b89\u5168\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff1a1\uff09\u5b89\u5168\u68af\u5ea6\u4f4d\u4e8e\u4f4e\u79e9\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6548\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u5219\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b2\uff09\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u901a\u5e38\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u51b2\u7a81\uff1b3\uff09\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u5411\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSPF\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u79fb\u9664\u4e0e\u4f4e\u79e9\u5b89\u5168\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5206\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\uff0cSPF\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u6548\u7528\u6536\u655b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fb9\u754c\u5316\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6f02\u79fb\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e0a\uff0cSPF\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u51e0\u4e4e\u5168\u90e8\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u62b5\u6297\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

But it has already been shown that this is mathematically insufficient.\n  This work presents Topo-RAG, a framework that challenges the assumption that \"everything is text\". We propose a dual architecture that respects the topology of the data: we route fluid narrative through traditional dense retrievers, while tabular structures are processed by a Cell-Aware Late Interaction mechanism, preserving their spatial relationships. Evaluated on SEC-25, a synthetic enterprise corpus that mimics real-world complexity, Topo-RAG demonstrates an 18.4% improvement in nDCG@10 on hybrid queries compared to standard linearization approaches.

However, the application of these methods to node classification tasks still faces a number of challenges. First, existing data enhancement techniques may lead to significant differences from the original view when generating new views, which may weaken the relevance of the view and affect the efficiency of model training. Second, the vast majority of existing graph comparison learning algorithms rely on the use of a large number of negative samples. To address the above challenges, this study proposes a novel node classification contrast learning method called Simple Network Graph Comparative Learning (SNGCL). Specifically, SNGCL employs a superimposed multilayer Laplace smoothing filter as a step in processing the data to obtain global and local feature smoothing matrices, respectively, which are thus passed into the target and online networks of the siamese network, and finally employs an improved triple recombination loss function to bring the intra-class distance closer and the inter-class distance farther. We have compared SNGCL with state-of-the-art models in node classification tasks, and the experimental results show that SNGCL is strongly competitive in most tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our key insight is that targeted step-level interventions can fundamentally transform inference efficiency by confining expensive calls to precisely those steps where stronger models prevent cascading errors. TRIM operates at the step-level: it uses process reward models to identify erroneous steps and makes routing decisions based on step-level uncertainty and budget constraints. We develop several routing strategies within TRIM, ranging from a simple threshold-based policy to more expressive policies that reason about long-horizon accuracy-cost trade-offs and uncertainty in step-level correctness estimates. On MATH-500, even the simplest thresholding strategy surpasses prior routing methods with 5x higher cost efficiency, while more advanced policies match the strong, expensive model's performance using 80% fewer expensive model tokens. On harder benchmarks such as AIME, TRIM achieves up to 6x higher cost efficiency.

Unlike existing benchmarks that primarily assess models' proficiency in reasoning-based geometry-where solutions are derived using algebraic methods-NoReGeo focuses on evaluating whether LLMs can inherently encode spatial relationships and recognize geometric properties directly. Our benchmark comprises 2,500 trivial geometric problems spanning 25 categories, each carefully crafted to be solvable purely through native geometric understanding, assuming known object locations. We assess a range of state-of-the-art models on NoReGeo, including frontier models like GPT-4, observing that even the most advanced systems achieve an overall maximum of 65% accuracy in binary classification tasks. Further, our ablation experiments demonstrate that such geometric understanding does not emerge through fine-tuning alone, indicating that effective training for geometric comprehension requires a specialized approach from the outset. Our findings highlight a significant gap in current LLMs' ability to natively grasp geometric concepts, providing a foundation for future research toward models with true geometric cognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Common approaches either rely on rigid statistical assumptions or attempt to decouple ranking and regression using ordered buckets; however, they often enforce ordinality through loss-based constraints rather than inherent architectural design, failing to balance global accuracy with high-value precision. To address this gap, we propose \\textbf{C}onditional \\textbf{C}ascaded \\textbf{O}rdinal-\\textbf{R}esidual Networks \\textbf{(CC-OR-Net)}, a novel unified framework that achieves a more robust decoupling through \\textbf{structural decomposition}, where ranking is architecturally guaranteed.

We first establish the Evidence-Augmented Reasoning paradigm, validating via Tree-Structured Evidence Sampling that precise evidence extraction is the decisive bottleneck for long-context reasoning. Guided by this insight, EAPO introduces a specialized RL algorithm where a reward model computes a Group-Relative Evidence Reward, providing dense process supervision to explicitly improve evidence quality. To sustain accurate supervision throughout training, we further incorporate an Adaptive Reward-Policy Co-Evolution mechanism. This mechanism iteratively refines the reward model using outcome-consistent rollouts, sharpening its discriminative capability to ensure precise process guidance.

By performing statistical correlation analysis directly on raw binary traffic, BiasSeeker identifies spurious or environment-entangled features that may compromise generalization, independent of any classifier. To address the diverse nature of shortcut features, we introduce a systematic categorization and apply category-specific validation strategies that reduce bias while preserving meaningful information.\n  We evaluate BiasSeeker on 19 public datasets across three NTC tasks. By emphasizing context-aware feature selection and dataset-specific diagnosis, BiasSeeker offers a novel perspective for understanding and addressing shortcut learning in encrypted network traffic classification, raising awareness that feature selection should be an intentional and scenario-sensitive step prior to model training.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These include respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) contamination, short-data instability in nonlinear metrics, and the neglect of individualized baselines in favor of population norms. We propose C-GRASP (Clinically-Grounded Reasoning for Affective Signal Processing), a guardrailed RAG-enhanced pipeline that decomposes HRV interpretation into eight traceable reasoning steps. Central to C-GRASP is a Z-score Priority Hierarchy that enforces the weighting of individualized baseline shifts over normative statistics. The system effectively mitigates spectral hallucinations through automated RSA-aware guardrails, preventing contamination of frequency-domain indices. Evaluated on 414 trials from the DREAMER dataset, C-GRASP integrated with high-scale reasoning models (e.g., MedGemma3-thinking) achieved superior performance in 4-class emotion classification (37.3% accuracy) and a Clinical Reasoning Consistency (CRC) score of 69.6%. Ablation studies confirm that the individualized Delta Z-score module serves as the critical logical anchor, preventing the \"population bias\" common in native LLMs. Ultimately, C-GRASP transitions affective computing from black-box classification to transparent, evidence-based clinical decision support, paving the way for safer AI integration in biomedical engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 C\u2011GRASP \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u548c Z\u2011\u5206\u6570\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fc3\u7387\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u56e0\u547c\u5438\u6027\u7aa6\u6027\u5fc3\u5f8b\u5931\u5e38\u7b49\u751f\u7406\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u4e2a\u4f53\u57fa\u7ebf\u5ffd\u7565\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6307\u6807\u77ed\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u800c\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u60c5\u7eea\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fc3\u5fc3\u7387\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff08HRV\uff09\u662f\u81ea\u4e3b\u795e\u7ecf\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65e0\u521b\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u7528\u4e8e HRV \u89e3\u91ca\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u751f\u7406\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5982\u547c\u5438\u6027\u7aa6\u6027\u5fc3\u5f8b\u5931\u5e38\u6c61\u67d3\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6307\u6807\u5728\u77ed\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e2a\u4f53\u57fa\u7ebf\u800c\u4f9d\u8d56\u7fa4\u4f53\u5e38\u6a21\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6eaf\u6e90\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa C\u2011GRASP\uff08\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a5\u5730\u6c14\u7684\u60c5\u7eea\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e RAG \u7684\u3001\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5c06 HRV \u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u516b\u4e2a\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u662f Z\u2011\u5206\u6570\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u5c42\u7ea7\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u5bf9\u4e2a\u4f53\u57fa\u7ebf\u53d8\u5316\u7ed9\u4e88\u6bd4\u7fa4\u4f53\u7edf\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684 RSA \u611f\u77e5\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u9891\u57df\u6307\u6807\u88ab\u547c\u5438\u6027\u7aa6\u6027\u5fc3\u5f8b\u5931\u5e38\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f13\u89e3\u9891\u8c31\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u5728 DREAMER \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684 414 \u6b21\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "C\u2011GRASP \u4e0e\u9ad8\u89c4\u6a21\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982 MedGemma3\u2011thinking\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u7c7b\u60c5\u7eea\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230 37.3% \u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08CRC\uff09\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a 69.6%\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u786e\u8ba4\uff0c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316 Delta Z\u2011\u5206\u6570\u6a21\u5757\u662f\u5173\u952e\u903b\u8f91\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u539f\u751f LLM \u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u201c\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u201d\u3002", "conclusion": "C\u2011GRASP \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u9ed1\u76d2\u5206\u7c7b\u5230\u900f\u660e\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u96c6\u6210\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u60c5\u7eea\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u751f\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86 HRV \u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing refusal strategies for such queries either rely on output-level instruction following, which is brittle due to model hallucinations, or estimate output uncertainty, which adds complexity and overhead. To address this challenge, we formalize safe refusal in text-to-SQL systems as an answerability-gating problem and propose LatentRefusal, a latent-signal refusal mechanism that predicts query answerability from intermediate hidden activations of a large language model. We introduce the Tri-Residual Gated Encoder, a lightweight probing architecture, to suppress schema noise and amplify sparse, localized cues of question-schema mismatch that indicate unanswerability. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse ambiguous and unanswerable settings, together with ablation studies and interpretability analyses, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show that LatentRefusal provides an attachable and efficient safety layer for text-to-SQL systems. Across four benchmarks, LatentRefusal improves average F1 to 88.5 percent on both backbones while adding approximately 2 milliseconds of probe overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

For cases where the noise is not independent and identically distributed across features (i.e., the covariance is not spherical) we introduce Graph Regularized PCA (GR-PCA). It is a graph-based regularization of PCA that incorporates the dependency structure of the data features by learning a sparse precision graph and biasing loadings toward the low-frequency Fourier modes of the corresponding graph Laplacian. Consequently, high-frequency signals are suppressed, while graph-coherent low-frequency ones are preserved, yielding interpretable principal components aligned with conditional relationships. We evaluate GR-PCA on synthetic data spanning diverse graph topologies, signal-to-noise ratios, and sparsity levels. Compared to mainstream alternatives, it concentrates variance on the intended support, produces loadings with lower graph-Laplacian energy, and remains competitive in out-of-sample reconstruction. When high-frequency signals are present, the graph Laplacian penalty prevents overfitting, reducing the reconstruction accuracy but improving structural fidelity. The advantage over PCA is most pronounced when high-frequency signals are graph-correlated, whereas PCA remains competitive when such signals are nearly rotationally invariant. The procedure is simple to implement, modular with respect to the precision estimator, and scalable, providing a practical route to structure-aware dimensionality reduction that improves structural fidelity without sacrificing predictive performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684PCA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u56fe\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u6291\u5236\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u4f4e\u9891\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u975e\u7403\u5f62\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fdd\u53cdPCA\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u566a\u58f0\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u5f53\u566a\u58f0\u4e0d\u662f\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\uff08\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u975e\u7403\u5f62\uff09\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfPCA\u4e0d\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u878d\u5408\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "GR-PCA\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6269\u5c55PCA\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff1a1) \u5b66\u4e60\u7a00\u758f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u83b7\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b2) \u5c06\u8f7d\u8377\u504f\u7f6e\u81f3\u5bf9\u5e94\u56fe\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u800c\u4fdd\u7559\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u5206\u91cf\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u3001\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0cGR-PCA\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aa) \u5c06\u65b9\u5dee\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u652f\u6491\u96c6\uff1bb) \u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u4f4e\u56fe\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u8f7d\u8377\uff1bc) \u6837\u672c\u5916\u91cd\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff1bd) \u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\uff0c\u56fe\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u60e9\u7f5a\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff08\u867d\u91cd\u6784\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7565\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\u3002\u5176\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u56fe\u8c31\u76f8\u5173\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8ePCA\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a5\u8fd1\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u65f6PCA\u4ecd\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "GR-PCA\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u964d\u7ef4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u5728\u4e8e\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347PCA\u5728\u975e\u7403\u5f62\u566a\u58f0\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated prowess in short-horizon reasoning, they are easily overwhelmed by execution details in the high-dimensional, delayed-feedback environments of real-world research, failing to consolidate sparse feedback into coherent long-term guidance. Here, we present ML-Master 2.0, an autonomous agent that masters ultra-long-horizon machine learning engineering (MLE) which is a representative microcosm of scientific discovery. By reframing context management as a process of cognitive accumulation, our approach introduces Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered architecture inspired by computer systems that enables the structural differentiation of experience over time. By dynamically distilling transient execution traces into stable knowledge and cross-task wisdom, HCC allows agents to decouple immediate execution from long-term experimental strategy, effectively overcoming the scaling limits of static context windows. In evaluations on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets, ML-Master 2.0 achieves a state-of-the-art medal rate of 56.44%. Our findings demonstrate that ultra-long-horizon autonomy provides a scalable blueprint for AI capable of autonomous exploration beyond human-precedent complexities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

But most relevant works are based on outcome rewards at the trajectory level, missing fine-grained supervision during the reasoning process. Other existing training frameworks that try to combine process signals together to optimize LLMs also rely heavily on tedious additional steps like MCTS, training a separate reward model, etc., doing harm to the training efficiency. Moreover, the intuition behind the process signals design lacks rigorous theoretical support, leaving the understanding of the optimization mechanism opaque. In this paper, we propose Process Reward Learning (PRL), which decomposes the entropy regularized reinforcement learning objective into intermediate steps, with rigorous process rewards that could be assigned to models accordingly. Starting from theoretical motivation, we derive the formulation of PRL that is essentially equivalent to the objective of reward maximization plus a KL-divergence penalty term between the policy model and a reference model. However, PRL could turn the outcome reward into process supervision signals, which helps better guide the exploration during RL optimization.

However, existing evaluation methods, including LLM-based evaluators, mainly adopt a black-box and holistic paradigm without explicit error modeling, leading to the neglect of such defects and overestimation of question quality. To address this issue, we propose ErrEval, a flexible and Error-aware Evaluation framework that enhances QG evaluation through explicit error diagnostics. Specifically, ErrEval reformulates evaluation as a two-stage process of error diagnosis followed by informed scoring. At the first stage, a lightweight plug-and-play Error Identifier detects and categorizes common errors across structural, linguistic, and content-related aspects. These diagnostic signals are then incorporated as explicit evidence to guide LLM evaluators toward more fine-grained and grounded judgments. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ErrEval, showing that incorporating explicit diagnostics improves alignment with human judgments.

We analyze DP-SGD in the $f$-differential privacy framework, which characterizes privacy via hypothesis-testing trade-off curves, and study shuffled sampling over a single epoch with $M$ gradient updates. We derive an explicit suboptimal upper bound on the achievable trade-off curve. This result induces a geometric lower bound on the separation $\u03ba$ which is the maximum distance between the mechanism's trade-off curve and the ideal random-guessing line. Because a large separation implies significant adversarial advantage, meaningful privacy requires small $\u03ba$. However, we prove that enforcing a small separation imposes a strict lower bound on the Gaussian noise multiplier $\u03c3$, which directly limits the achievable utility. In particular, under the standard worst-case adversarial model, shuffled DP-SGD must satisfy\n  $\u03c3\\ge \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\ln M}}$ $\\quad\\text{or}\\quad$ $\u03ba\\ge\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}\\!\\left(1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\u03c0\\ln M}}\\right)$,\n  and thus cannot simultaneously achieve strong privacy and high utility. Although this bound vanishes asymptotically as $M \\to \\infty$, the convergence is extremely slow: even for practically relevant numbers of updates the required noise magnitude remains substantial. We further show that the same limitation extends to Poisson subsampling up to constant factors. Our experiments confirm that the noise levels implied by this bound leads to significant accuracy degradation at realistic training settings, thus showing a critical bottleneck in DP-SGD under standard worst-case adversarial assumptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Privacy policies are often difficult for people to fully comprehend due to the lengthy and complex legal language used and inconsistent practices across different sectors and organisations. To help conduct automated and large-scale analyses of privacy policies, many researchers have studied applications of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, including large language models (LLMs). While a limited number of prior studies utilised LLMs for extracting personal data flows from privacy policies, our approach builds on this line of work by combining LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a customised knowledge base derived from existing studies. This paper presents the development of LADFA, an end-to-end computational framework, which can process unstructured text in a given privacy policy, extract personal data flows and construct a personal data flow graph, and conduct analysis of the data flow graph to facilitate insight discovery. The framework consists of a pre-processor, an LLM-based processor, and a data flow post-processor. We demonstrated and validated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach by conducting a case study that involved examining ten selected privacy policies from the automotive industry. Moreover, it is worth noting that LADFA is designed to be flexible and customisable, making it suitable for a range of text-based analysis tasks beyond privacy policy analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, during training, its optimization behavior does not always align with theoretical expectations, since both sharp and flat regions may yield a small perturbed loss. In such cases, the gradient may still point toward sharp regions, failing to achieve the intended effect of SAM. To address this issue, we investigate SAM from a spectral and geometric perspective: specifically, we utilize the angle between the gradient and the leading eigenvector of the Hessian as a measure of sharpness. Our analysis illustrates that when this angle is less than or equal to ninety degrees, the effect of SAM's sharpness regularization can be weakened. Furthermore, we propose an explicit eigenvector-aligned SAM (X-SAM), which corrects the gradient via orthogonal decomposition along the top eigenvector, enabling more direct and efficient regularization of the Hessian's maximum eigenvalue.

These signals then guide the training of the doctor model via TFPO, which establishes flow consistency across all subtrajectories, enabling precise token-by-token alignment while inherently preserving generation diversity.

Queries arrive according to a Poisson process, and each type occurs with a known prior probability. For each task type, the server allocates a fixed number of internal thinking tokens, which determines the computational effort devoted to that query. The token allocation induces an accuracy-latency trade-off: the service time follows an approximately affine function of the allocated tokens, while the probability of a correct response exhibits diminishing returns. Under a first-in, first-out (FIFO) service discipline, the system operates as an $M/G/1$ queue, and the mean system time depends on the first and second moments of the resulting service-time distribution. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a weighted average accuracy objective penalized by the mean system time, subject to architectural token-budget constraints and queue-stability conditions. The objective function is shown to be strictly concave over the stability region, which ensures existence and uniqueness of the optimal token allocation.

However, existing studies face challenges in domain incremental learning. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and robust dual-causal disentanglement framework (DualCD) to enhance the robustness of models under domain incremental scenarios, which can be seamlessly integrated into time series classification models. Specifically, DualCD first introduces a temporal feature disentanglement module to capture class-causal features and spurious features. The causal features can offer sufficient predictive power to support the classifier in domain incremental learning settings. To accurately capture these causal features, we further design a dual-causal intervention mechanism to eliminate the influence of both intra-class and inter-class confounding features. This mechanism constructs variant samples by combining the current class's causal features with intra-class spurious features and with causal features from other classes. The causal intervention loss encourages the model to accurately predict the labels of these variant samples based solely on the causal features. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models demonstrate that DualCD effectively improves performance in domain incremental scenarios. We summarize our rich experiments into a comprehensive benchmark to facilitate research in domain incremental time series classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Mistral models on a high-stakes phishing detection task and use SHAP analysis and mechanistic interpretability to uncover the root causes of their generalization failures. Our investigation reveals three critical findings: (1) Generalization is driven by a powerful synergy between architecture and data diversity. The Gemma 2 9B model achieves state-of-the-art performance (>91\\% F1), but only when trained on a stylistically diverse ``generalist'' dataset. (2) Generalization is highly architecture-dependent. We diagnose a specific failure mode in Llama 3.1 8B, which performs well on a narrow domain but cannot integrate diverse data, leading to a significant performance drop. (3) Some architectures are inherently more generalizable. The Mistral model proves to be a consistent and resilient performer across multiple training paradigms.

The core challenge lies in modeling the underlying complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Various methods have been proposed, and recent studies show that the modeling of dynamics is useful to meet the core challenge. While handling spatial dependencies and temporal dependencies using separate base model structures may hinder the modeling of spatio-temporal correlations, the modeling of dynamics can bridge this gap. Incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity also advances the main goal, since it can extend the parameter space and allow more flexibility. Despite these advances, two limitations persist: 1) the modeling of dynamics is often limited to the dynamics of spatial topology (e.g., adjacency matrix changes), which, however, can be extended to a broader scope; 2) the modeling of heterogeneity is often separated for spatial and temporal dimensions, but this gap can also be bridged by the modeling of dynamics. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for traffic prediction, called Meta Dynamic Graph (MetaDG). MetaDG leverages dynamic graph structures of node representations to explicitly model spatio-temporal dynamics.

However, whether these advances yield commensurate improvements in safety remains unclear, in part due to fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5. We evaluate each model across language, vision-language, and image generation settings using a unified protocol that integrates benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation. Aggregating our evaluations into safety leaderboards and model safety profiles across multiple evaluation modes reveals a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. While GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced safety performance across evaluations, other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation, with all models degrading substantially despite strong results on standard benchmarks. Text-to-image models achieve relatively stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain brittle under adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these results show that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation scheme, underscoring the need for standardized safety evaluations to accurately assess real-world risk and guide responsible model development and deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

SS measures consistency in behavioral strategy across temporal steps, while SuS captures unexpected outcomes relative to the agent's current strategy representation. Our combined reward formulation leverages both signals through learned weighting coefficients. We evaluate SuS on mathematical reasoning tasks using large language models, demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity. Ablation studies confirm that removing either component results in at least 10% performance degradation, validating the synergistic nature of our approach.

Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, recent studies show that such alignment is often shallow and remains vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms, including decoding-based constraints and post-hoc content detectors, struggle against sophisticated jailbreaks, often intervening robust detection or excessively degrading model utility. In this work, we examine the decoding process of LLMs and make a key observation: even when successfully jailbroken, models internally exhibit latent safety-related signals during generation. However, these signals are overridden by the model's drive for fluent continuation, preventing timely self-correction or refusal. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective approach that explicitly surfaces and leverages these latent safety signals for early detection of unsafe content during decoding. Experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances safety, while maintaining low over-refusal rates on benign inputs and preserving response quality. Our results suggest that activating intrinsic safety-awareness during decoding offers a promising and complementary direction for defending against jailbreak attacks.

Time-series extrinsic regression (TSER) models increasingly leverage PPG signals to estimate clinically relevant outcomes, including heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. For clinical reasoning and trust, however, single point estimates alone are insufficient: clinicians must also understand whether predictions are stable under physiologically plausible variations and to what extent realistic, attainable changes in physiological signals would meaningfully alter a model's prediction. Counterfactual explanations (CFE) address these \"what-if\" questions, yet existing time series CFE generation methods are largely restricted to classification, overlook waveform morphology, and often produce physiologically implausible signals, limiting their applicability to continuous biomedical time series. To address these limitations, we introduce EvoMorph, a multi-objective evolutionary framework for generating physiologically plausible and diverse CFE for TSER applications. EvoMorph optimizes morphology-aware objectives defined on interpretable signal descriptors and applies transformations to preserve the waveform structure. We evaluated EvoMorph on three PPG datasets (heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) against a nearest-unlike-neighbor baseline. In addition, in a case study, we evaluated EvoMorph as a tool for uncertainty quantification by relating counterfactual sensitivity to bootstrap-ensemble uncertainty and data-density measures.

Graph condensation methods address this by generating small synthetic graphs that approximate the original data. However, existing approaches rely on clean, supervised labels, which limits their reliability when labels are scarce, noisy, or inconsistent. We propose Pseudo-Labeled Graph Condensation (PLGC), a self-supervised framework that constructs latent pseudo-labels from node embeddings and optimizes condensed graphs to match the original graph's structural and feature statistics -- without requiring ground-truth labels. PLGC offers three key contributions: (1) A diagnosis of why supervised condensation fails under label noise and distribution shift. (2) A label-free condensation method that jointly learns latent prototypes and node assignments. (3) Theoretical guarantees showing that pseudo-labels preserve latent structural statistics of the original graph and ensure accurate embedding alignment. Empirically, across node classification and link prediction tasks, PLGC achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art supervised condensation methods on clean datasets and exhibits substantial robustness under label noise, often outperforming all baselines by a significant margin.

A Mechanistic Analysis of Hierarchical Reasoning Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Hierarchical reasoning model (HRM) achieves extraordinary performance on various reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming large language model-based reasoners. To understand the strengths and potential failure modes of HRM, we conduct a mechanistic study on its reasoning patterns and find three surprising facts: (a) Failure of extremely simple puzzles, e.g., HRM can fail on a puzzle with only one unknown cell. We attribute this failure to the violation of the fixed point property, a fundamental assumption of HRM. (b) \"Grokking\" dynamics in reasoning steps, i.e., the answer is not improved uniformly, but instead there is a critical reasoning step that suddenly makes the answer correct; (c) Existence of multiple fixed points. HRM \"guesses\" the first fixed point, which could be incorrect, and gets trapped there for a while or forever. All facts imply that HRM appears to be \"guessing\" instead of \"reasoning\". Leveraging this \"guessing\" picture, we propose three strategies to scale HRM's guesses: data augmentation (scaling the quality of guesses), input perturbation (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging inference randomness), and model bootstrapping (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging training randomness). On the practical side, by combining all methods, we develop Augmented HRM, boosting accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme from 54.5% to 96.9%.

While it has been shown that such information can drastically boost the value, finding the optimal policy is NP-hard, and it is common to apply one of two tractable heuristics: processing the lookahead in chunks of predefined sizes ('fixed batching policies'), and model predictive control. We first illustrate the problems with these two approaches and propose utilizing the lookahead in adaptive (state-dependent) batches; we refer to such policies as adaptive batching policies (ABPs). We derive the optimal Bellman equations for these strategies and design an optimistic regret-minimizing algorithm that enables learning the optimal ABP when interacting with unknown environments. Our regret bounds are order-optimal up to a potential factor of the lookahead horizon $\\ell$, which can usually be considered a small constant.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The approach causes fragmentation in information graphs in document structures, over-retrieval, and duplication of content alongside insufficient query context, including 2nd and 3rd order facets. In this paper, a structure-informed and diversity-constrained context bubble construction framework is proposed that assembles coherent, citable bundles of spans under a strict token budget. The method preserves and exploits inherent document structure by organising multi-granular spans (e.g., sections and rows) and using task-conditioned structural priors to guide retrieval. Starting from high-relevance anchor spans, a context bubble is constructed through constrained selection that balances query relevance, marginal coverage, and redundancy penalties. It will explicitly constrain diversity and budget, producing compact and informative context sets, unlike top-k retrieval. Moreover, a full retrieval is emitted that traces the scoring and selection choices of the records, thus providing auditability and deterministic tuning. Experiments on enterprise documents demonstrate the efficiency of context bubble as it significantly reduces redundant context, is better able to cover secondary facets and has a better answer quality and citation faithfulness within a limited context window. Ablation studies demonstrate that both structural priors as well as diversity constraint selection are necessary; removing either component results in a decline in coverage and an increase in redundant or incomplete context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u6863\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff08context bubble\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e14\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u91cd\u590d\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u4f7f\u7528top-k\u6bb5\u843d\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u56fe\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u91cd\u590d\u3001\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e0\u6cd5\u8986\u76d6\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u4e8c\u7ea7\u548c\u4e09\u7ea7\u65b9\u9762\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c14\u6ce1\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6587\u6863\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u8282\u3001\u8868\u683c\u884c\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u6307\u5bfc\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u4ece\u9ad8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u951a\u70b9\u8de8\u5ea6\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u9009\u62e9\u6784\u5efa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c14\u6ce1\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u8fb9\u9645\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002\u8f93\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u5b8c\u6574\u68c0\u7d22\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u6587\u6863\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c14\u6ce1\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u6b21\u8981\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5f15\u7528\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u9009\u62e9\u4e24\u8005\u7f3a\u4e00\u4e0d\u53ef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u6587\u6863\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u96c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Design outcomes were evaluated by expert raters, while self-efficacy and cognitive load were self-reported after each phase. Difference-in-differences analyses revealed no overall performance advantage of GenAI across participants; however, subgroup analyses showed that GenAI significantly improved design performance for novice designers.

In this paper, we propose a mixture of transparent local models as an alternative solution for designing interpretable (or transparent) models. Our approach is designed for the situations where a simple and transparent function is suitable for modeling the label of instances in some localities/regions of the input space, but may change abruptly as we move from one locality to another. Consequently, the proposed algorithm is to learn both the transparent labeling function and the locality of the input space where the labeling function achieves a small risk in its assigned locality. By using a new multi-predictor (and multi-locality) loss function, we established rigorous PAC-Bayesian risk bounds for the case of binary linear classification problem and that of linear regression. In both cases, synthetic data sets were used to illustrate how the learning algorithms work. The results obtained from real data sets highlight the competitiveness of our approach compared to other existing methods as well as certain opaque models.

However, standard CBMs often overlook domain-specific relationships and causal mechanisms, and their dependence on complete concept labels limits applicability in scientific domains where supervision is sparse but processes are well defined. To address this, we propose the Process-Guided Concept Bottleneck Model (PG-CBM), an extension of CBMs which constrains learning to follow domain-defined causal mechanisms through biophysically meaningful intermediate concepts. Using above ground biomass density estimation from Earth Observation data as a case study, we show that PG-CBM reduces error and bias compared to multiple benchmarks, whilst leveraging multi-source heterogeneous training data and producing interpretable intermediate outputs.

However, their adoption in financial applications is hindered by fundamental limitations in uncertainty quantification: current approaches either rely on restrictive distributional assumptions, conflate different sources of uncertainty, or lack principled calibration mechanisms. While recent TSFMs employ sophisticated techniques such as mixture models, Student's t-distributions, or conformal prediction, they fail to address the core challenge of providing theoretically-grounded uncertainty decomposition. For the very first time, we present a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework, ProbFM (probabilistic foundation model), that leverages Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to provide principled uncertainty quantification with explicit epistemic-aleatoric decomposition. Unlike existing approaches that pre-specify distributional forms or require sampling-based inference, ProbFM learns optimal uncertainty representations through higher-order evidence learning while maintaining single-pass computational efficiency. To rigorously evaluate the core DER uncertainty quantification approach independent of architectural complexity, we conduct an extensive controlled comparison study using a consistent LSTM architecture across five probabilistic methods: DER, Gaussian NLL, Student's-t NLL, Quantile Loss, and Conformal Prediction. Evaluation on cryptocurrency return forecasting demonstrates that DER maintains competitive forecasting accuracy while providing explicit epistemic-aleatoric uncertainty decomposition. This work establishes both an extensible framework for principled uncertainty quantification in foundation models and empirical evidence for DER's effectiveness in financial applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This has spurred an intense interest in the origin of neural scaling laws, with a common suggestion being that they arise from power law structure already present in the data. In this paper we study scaling laws for transformers trained to predict random walks (bigrams) on graphs with tunable complexity. We demonstrate that this simplified setting already gives rise to neural scaling laws even in the absence of power law structure in the data correlations. We further consider dialing down the complexity of natural language systematically, by training on sequences sampled from increasingly simplified generative language models, from 4,2,1-layer transformer language models down to language bigrams, revealing a monotonic evolution of the scaling exponents. Our results also include scaling laws obtained from training on random walks on random graphs drawn from Erd\u00f6s-Renyi and scale-free Barab\u00e1si-Albert ensembles. Finally, we revisit conventional scaling laws for language modeling, demonstrating that several essential results can be reproduced using 2 layer transformers with context length of 50, provide a critical analysis of various fits used in prior literature, demonstrate an alternative method for obtaining compute optimal curves as compared with current practice in published literature, and provide preliminary evidence that maximal update parameterization may be more parameter efficient than standard parameterization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although reduced-order models (ROMs) offer a promising solution, current methods often struggle with stochastic dynamics and fail to quantify prediction uncertainty, limiting their utility in robust decision-making contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce a data-driven framework for learning continuous-time stochastic ROMs that generalize across parameter spaces and forcing conditions. Our approach, based on amortized stochastic variational inference, leverages a reparametrization trick for Markov Gaussian processes to eliminate the need for computationally expensive forward solvers during training. This enables us to jointly learn a probabilistic autoencoder and stochastic differential equations governing the latent dynamics, at a computational cost that is independent of the dataset size and system stiffness. Additionally, our approach offers the flexibility of incorporating physics-informed priors if available.

CEPAM leverages the rejection-sampled universal quantizer (RSUQ), a randomized vector quantizer whose quantization error is equivalent to a prescribed noise, which can be tuned to customize privacy protection between parties.

We introduce a server-side aggregation rule called staleness-bucket aggregation with padding that deterministically enforces a prescribed staleness profile over update ages without assuming any stochastic model for delays or participation. Under margin separability and bounded data radius, we prove a finite-horizon expected bound on the cumulative weighted number of perceptron mistakes over a given number of server rounds: the impact of delay appears only through the mean enforced staleness, whereas communication noise contributes an additional term that grows on the order of the square root of the horizon with the total noise energy.

In this work, we propose a new solver for diffusion models relying on a subtle interplay between low-degree approximation and the collocation method (Lee, Song, Vempala 2018), and we prove that its iteration complexity scales \\emph{polylogarithmically} in $1/\\varepsilon$, yielding the first ``high-accuracy'' guarantee for a diffusion-based sampler that only uses (approximate) access to the scores of the data distribution. In addition, our bound does not depend explicitly on the ambient dimension; more precisely, the dimension affects the complexity of our solver through the \\emph{effective radius} of the support of the target distribution only.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u9636\u903c\u8fd1\u548c\u914d\u70b9\u6cd5\u7684\u65b0\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u7ea7\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6c42\u89e3\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u968f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5448\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u8fed\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5448\u591a\u5bf9\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u65b0\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4e\u9636\u903c\u8fd1\u548c\u914d\u70b9\u6cd5\uff08Lee, Song, Vempala 2018\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bbf\u95ee\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65b0\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e1/\u03b5\u5448\u591a\u5bf9\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u663e\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u652f\u6491\u96c6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u534a\u5f84\u5f71\u54cd\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u201c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u201d\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Widely used architectures for neural solvers, such as sinusoidal neural networks, are coordinate-based MLPs that are both computationally intensive and slow to train. Although grid-based alternatives for implicit representations (e.g., Instant-NGP and K-Planes) train faster by exploiting signal structure, their reliance on linear interpolation restricts their ability to compute higher-order derivatives, rendering them unsuitable for solving DEs. Our approach overcomes these limitations by combining the efficiency of feature grids with radial basis function interpolation, which is infinitely differentiable. To effectively capture high-frequency solutions and enable stable and faster computation of global gradients, we introduce a multi-resolution decomposition with co-located grids. Our proposed representation, DInf-Grid, is trained implicitly using the differential equations as loss functions, enabling accurate modelling of physical fields. We validate DInf-Grid on a variety of tasks, including the Poisson equation for image reconstruction, the Helmholtz equation for wave fields, and the Kirchhoff-Love boundary value problem for cloth simulation. Our results demonstrate a 5-20x speed-up over coordinate-based MLP-based methods, solving differential equations in seconds or minutes while maintaining comparable accuracy and compactness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
