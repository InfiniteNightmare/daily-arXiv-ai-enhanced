We propose a formulation that yields closed-form expressions for optimal load allocation and completion time that explicitly quantify the joint impact of computation speed, link bandwidth, and result-size overhead. We further derive deadline feasibility conditions that enable explicit sizing of cooperative satellite clusters to meet time-critical task requirements. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that highly distributable tasks achieve substantial latency reduction, while communication-heavy tasks exhibit diminishing returns due to result-transfer overheads. To bridge theory and practice, we extend the MPCC-DLT framework with a real-time admission control mechanism that handles stochastic task arrivals and deadline constraints, enabling blocking-aware operation. Our real-time simulations illustrate how task structure and system parameters jointly govern deadline satisfaction and operating regimes. Overall, this work provides the first analytically tractable MPCC-DLT model for distributed satellite systems and offers actionable insights for application-aware scheduling and system-level design of future satellite constellations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u536b\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u5f0f\u7684\u591a\u7aef\u53e3\u5e76\u53d1\u901a\u4fe1\u53ef\u5206\u914d\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u536b\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u952e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5e76\u53d1\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u3001\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u8fd4\u56de\u8fd9\u4e00\u5b8c\u6574\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u94fe\u8def\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u4f20\u8f93\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e94\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MPCC-DLT\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u95ed\u5f0f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5206\u914d\u548c\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u622a\u6b62\u671f\u9650\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u51c6\u5165\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5904\u7406\u968f\u673a\u4efb\u52a1\u5230\u8fbe\u548c\u622a\u6b62\u671f\u9650\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u5206\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u56e0\u7ed3\u679c\u4f20\u8f93\u5f00\u9500\u800c\u5448\u73b0\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u540c\u51b3\u5b9a\u622a\u6b62\u671f\u9650\u6ee1\u8db3\u5ea6\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u53ef\u5206\u6790\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u536b\u661f\u7cfb\u7edfMPCC-DLT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u661f\u5ea7\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u90e8\u7f72\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6865\u6881\u3002"}}

While prior work has documented the generation of toxic content by LLMs, far less is known about how exposure to harmful content shapes agent behavior over time, particularly in environments composed entirely of interacting AI agents. In this work, we study toxicity adoption of LLM-driven agents on Chirper.ai, a fully AI-driven social platform. Specifically, we model interactions in terms of stimuli (posts) and responses (comments), and by operationalizing exposure through observable interactions rather than inferred recommendation mechanisms.\n  We conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of agent behavior, examining how response toxicity relates to stimulus toxicity, how repeated exposure affects the likelihood of toxic responses, and whether toxic behavior can be predicted from exposure alone. Our findings show that while toxic responses are more likely following toxic stimuli, a substantial fraction of toxicity emerges spontaneously, independent of exposure. At the same time, cumulative toxic exposure significantly increases the probability of toxic responding. We further introduce two influence metrics, the Influence-Driven Response Rate and the Spontaneous Response Rate, revealing a strong trade-off between induced and spontaneous toxicity. Finally, we show that the number of toxic stimuli alone enables accurate prediction of whether an agent will eventually produce toxic content.\n  These results highlight exposure as a critical risk factor in the deployment of LLM agents and suggest that monitoring encountered content may provide a lightweight yet effective mechanism for auditing and mitigating harmful behavior in the wild.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\uff0cLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u66b4\u9732\u4e8e\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u5176\u540e\u7eed\u4ea7\u751f\u6bd2\u6027\u56de\u590d\u7684\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u6bd2\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u7531\u906d\u9047\u7684\u6bd2\u6027\u523a\u6fc0\u6b21\u6570\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e86LLM\u751f\u6210\u6bd2\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u66b4\u9732\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u5851\u9020\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u2014\u2014\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u7531AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u6784\u6210\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u2014\u2014\u4ecd\u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u5728\u7ebf\u793e\u4ea4\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u906d\u9047\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u540e\u662f\u5426\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u4ea7\u751f\u6bd2\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u7531AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u5e73\u53f0Chirper.ai\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u523a\u6fc0(\u5e16\u5b50)\u548c\u56de\u5e94(\u8bc4\u8bba)\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08\u800c\u975e\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u673a\u5236\uff09\u6765\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u2018\u66b4\u9732\u2019\uff0c\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u56de\u5e94\u6bd2\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u523a\u6fc0\u6bd2\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u3001\u91cd\u590d\u66b4\u9732\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6bd2\u6027\u56de\u5e94\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6bd2\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u5426\u4ec5\u51ed\u66b4\u9732\u5373\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u9a71\u52a8\u56de\u5e94\u7387\u548c\u81ea\u53d1\u56de\u5e94\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1. \u6bd2\u6027\u523a\u6fc0\u4e4b\u540e\u51fa\u73b0\u6bd2\u6027\u56de\u5e94\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1b2. \u76f8\u5f53\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u6bd2\u6027\u662f\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u66b4\u9732\u800c\u81ea\u53d1\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\uff1b3. \u7d2f\u79ef\u7684\u6bd2\u6027\u66b4\u9732\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6bd2\u6027\u56de\u5e94\u7684\u6982\u7387\uff1b4. \u8bf1\u5bfc\u6bd2\u6027\u4e0e\u81ea\u53d1\u6bd2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b5. \u4ec5\u51ed\u906d\u9047\u7684\u6bd2\u6027\u523a\u6fc0\u6b21\u6570\u5c31\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6700\u7ec8\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u4ea7\u51fa\u6bd2\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u7a81\u51fa\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u662f\u90e8\u7f72LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u76d1\u63a7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u906d\u9047\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4f46\u6709\u6548\u7684\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5ba1\u8ba1\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u6709\u5bb3\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

However, heterogeneous resources, dynamic workloads, and diverse security requirements make optimal service placement highly challenging. Most solutions focus primarily on performance metrics while overlooking the security implications of deployment decisions. This paper proposes a Security and Performance-Aware Distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning (SPA-DDRL) framework for joint optimization of service response time and security compliance in Fog computing. The problem is formulated as a weighted multi-objective optimization task, minimizing latency while maximizing a security score derived from the security capabilities of Fog nodes. The security score features a new three-tier hierarchy, where configuration-level checks verify proper settings, capability-level assessments evaluate the resource security features, and control-level evaluations enforce stringent policies, thereby ensuring compliant solutions that align with performance objectives. SPA-DDRL adopts a distributed broker-learner architecture where multiple brokers perform autonomous service-placement decisions and a centralized learner coordinates global policy optimization through shared prioritized experiences. It integrates three key improvements, including Long Short-Term Memory networks, Prioritized Experience Replay, and off-policy correction mechanisms to improve the agent's performance. Experiments based on real IoT workloads show that SPA-DDRL significantly improves both service response time and placement security compared to current approaches, achieving a 16.3% improvement in response time and a 33% faster convergence rate. It also maintains consistent, feasible, security-compliant solutions across all system scales, while baseline techniques fail or show performance degradation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To resolve this, we propose a negotiation-based framework that, by design, guarantees voluntary participation, strategy-proofness, and budget feasibility. It transforms EV charging into a strategic resource by offering drivers a range of incentive-backed options for modest flexibility in their departure time or requested state of charge (SoC). Our framework is calibrated with user survey data and validated using real operational data from a commercial building and an EV manufacturer. Simulations show that our negotiation protocol creates a mutually beneficial outcome: lowering the building operator's costs by over 3.5\\% compared to an optimized, non-negotiating smart charging policy, while simultaneously reducing user charging expenses by 22\\% below the utility's retail energy rate. By aligning operator and EV user objectives, our framework provides a strategic bridge between energy and mobility systems, transforming EV charging from a source of operational friction into a platform for collaboration and shared savings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While general-purpose AI has proliferated, it remains fundamentally unsuited for the high-stakes epidemiological domain due to chronic hallucinations and an inability to navigate specialized data silos. This paper introduces ARIES (Agentic Retrieval Intelligence for Epidemiological Surveillance), a specialized, autonomous multi-agent framework designed to move beyond static, disease-specific dashboards toward a dynamic intelligence ecosystem. Built on a hierarchical command structure, ARIES utilizes GPTs to orchestrate a scalable swarm of sub-agents capable of autonomously querying World Health Organization (WHO), Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and peer-reviewed research papers. By automating the extraction and logical synthesis of surveillance data, ARIES provides a specialized reasoning that identifies emergent threats and signal divergence in near real-time.

Existing systems exhibit poor failure resilience: even a single worker failure triggers a coarse-grained, service-wide restart, discarding accumulated progress and halting the entire inference pipeline during recovery--an approach clearly ill-suited for latency-sensitive, LLM services.\n  We present Tarragon, a resilient MoE inference framework that confines the failures impact to individual workers while allowing the rest of the pipeline to continue making forward progress. Tarragon exploits the natural separation between the attention and expert computation in MoE-based transformers, treating attention workers (AWs) and expert workers (EWs) as distinct failure domains. Tarragon introduces a reconfigurable datapath to mask failures by rerouting requests to healthy workers. On top of this datapath, Tarragon implements a self-healing mechanism that relaxes the tightly synchronized execution of existing MoE frameworks. For stateful AWs, Tarragon performs asynchronous, incremental KV cache checkpointing with per-request restoration, and for stateless EWs, it leverages residual GPU memory to deploy shadow experts. These together keep recovery cost and recomputation overhead extremely low. Our evaluation shows that, compared to state-of-the-art MegaScale-Infer, Tarragon reduces failure-induced stalls by 160-213x (from ~64 s down to 0.3-0.4 s) while preserving performance when no failures occur.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite recent empirical evidence that horizon reduction can improve scaling on challenging offline RL benchmarks, its theoretical implications remain underdeveloped (Park et al., 2025). In this paper, we show that horizon reduction can induce fundamental and irrecoverable information loss in offline RL. We formalize horizon reduction as learning from fixed-length trajectory segments and prove that, under this paradigm and any learning interface restricted to fixed-length trajectory segments, optimal policies may be statistically indistinguishable from suboptimal ones even with infinite data and perfect function approximation. Through a set of minimal counterexample Markov decision processes (MDPs), we identify three distinct structural failure modes: (i) prefix indistinguishability leading to identifiability failure, (ii) objective misspecification induced by truncated returns, and (iii) offline dataset support and representation aliasing. Our results establish necessary conditions under which horizon reduction can be safe and highlight intrinsic limitations that cannot be overcome by algorithmic improvements alone, complementing algorithmic work on conservative objectives and distribution shift that addresses a different axis of offline RL difficulty (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020; Gulcehre et al., 2020).", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

An important task in such patterns is aggregation, which involves summarizing a set of values into a single value using an algebraic function, such as the maximum, sum, or average, among others. Despite the relevance of this task, query languages in CER typically support aggregation in a restricted syntactic form, and their semantics are generally undefined.\n  In this work, we present a first step toward formalizing a query language with aggregation for CER. We propose to extend Complex Event Logic (CEL), a formal query language for CER, with aggregation operations. This task requires revisiting the semantics of CEL, using a new semantics based on bags of tuples instead of sets of positions. Then, we present an extension of CEL, called Aggregation CEL (ACEL), which introduces an aggregation operator for any commutative monoid operation. The operator can be freely composed with previous CEL operators, allowing users to define complex queries and patterns. We showcase several queries in practice where ACEL proves to be natural for specifying them. From the computational side, we present a novel automata model, called Aggregation Complex Event Automata (ACEA), that extends the previous proposal of Complex Event Automata (CEA) with aggregation and filtering features. Moreover, we demonstrate that every query in ACEL can be expressed in ACEA, illustrating the effectiveness of our computational model. Finally, we study the expressiveness of ACEA through the lens of ACEL, showing that the automata model is more expressive than ACEL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u805a\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00ACEL\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u6a21\u578bACEA\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709CER\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u805a\u5408\u529f\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u590d\u6742\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u805a\u5408\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u6cd5\u9650\u5236\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u672a\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u805a\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u6765\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u4e8b\u4ef6\u903b\u8f91\uff08CEL\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u805a\u5408CEL\uff08ACEL\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5143\u7ec4\u888b\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u81ea\u7531\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u805a\u5408\u7b97\u5b50\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u805a\u5408\u590d\u6742\u4e8b\u4ef6\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff08ACEA\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86ACEL\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6bcf\u4e2aACEL\u67e5\u8be2\u90fd\u80fd\u7528ACEA\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u4f46ACEA\u6bd4ACEL\u66f4\u5177\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u805a\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ACEL\u8bed\u8a00\u548cACEA\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

Elections have been the canonical way by which modern democracy has operated since the 17th century. Nowadays, they regulate markets, provide an engine for modern recommender systems or peer-to-peer networks, and remain the main approach to represent democracy. However, a desirable universal voting rule that satisfies all hypothetical scenarios is still a challenging topic, and the design of these systems is at the forefront of mechanism design research. Automated mechanism design is a promising approach, and recent works have demonstrated that set-invariant architectures are uniquely suited to modelling electoral systems. However, various concerns prevent the direct application to real-world settings, such as robustness to strategic voting. In this paper, we generalise the expressive capability of learned voting rules, and combine improvements in neural network architecture with adversarial training to improve the resilience of voting rules while maximizing social welfare. We evaluate the effectiveness of our methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our method resolves critical limitations of prior work regarding learning voting rules by representing elections using bipartite graphs, and learning such voting rules using graph neural networks.

Traditional methods involve costly iterative testing, data materialization, and manual error detection, due to the lack of formal approaches to reasoning about data granularity (grain), which can shift during transformations, causing issues like fan traps (metrics duplication) and chasm traps (data loss). We introduce the first formal, mathematical definition of grain, extending it from an informal concept in dimensional modeling to a universal, type-theoretic framework applicable to any data type. Encoding grain into the type system allows compile-time verification of transformation correctness, shifting validation from runtime. We define three core grain relations-equality, ordering, and incomparability-and prove a general grain inference theorem that computes the output grain of equi-joins from input grains using type-level operations. This covers all join scenarios, including comparable and incomparable keys. Together with inference rules for relational operations, this enables verification through schema analysis alone, at zero cost. Our approach allows engineers to verify that entire pipeline DAGs maintain correctness properties, detecting grain-related errors such as fan traps, chasm traps, and aggregation issues before data processing. It emphasizes the importance of grain, focusing on critical characteristics rather than all data details. We provide machine-checked formal proofs in Lean 4, reducing verification costs by 98-99%. Additionally, large language models can automatically generate correctness proofs, shifting human effort from proof writing to proof verification, thus democratizing formal methods in data engineering and supporting confident deployment of AI-generated pipelines with machine-checkable guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Preserving both spatial and frequency representations of data is crucial for applications such as cosmology, turbulent combustion, and X-ray diffraction, where spatial and frequency views provide complementary scientific insights. In particular, many analysis tasks rely on frequency-domain representations to capture key features, including the power spectrum of cosmology simulations, the turbulent energy spectrum in combustion, and diffraction patterns in reciprocal space for ptychography. However, existing compression methods guarantee accuracy only in the spatial domain while disregarding the frequency domain. To address this limitation, we propose an algorithm that corrects the errors produced by off-the-shelf ``base'' compressors such as SZ3, ZFP, and SPERR, thereby preserving both spatial and frequency representations by bounding errors in both domains. By expressing frequency-domain errors as linear combinations of spatial-domain errors, we derive a region that jointly bounds errors in both domains. Given as input the spatial errors from a base compressor and user-defined error bounds in the spatial and frequency domains, we iteratively project the spatial error vector onto the regions defined by the spatial and frequency constraints until it lies within their intersection. We further accelerate the algorithm using GPU parallelism to achieve practical performance. We validate our approach with datasets from cosmology simulations, X-ray diffraction, combustion simulation, and electroencephalography demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving critical scientific information in both spatial and frequency domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u6821\u6b63\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65b0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u6709\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u548c\u9891\u7387\u57df\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u6295\u5f71\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u57df\u8bef\u5dee\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8054\u5408\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u8bb8\u591a\u79d1\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u6e4d\u6d41\u71c3\u70e7\u3001X\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\uff09\u9700\u540c\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u9891\u7387\u8868\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u9891\u7387\u57df\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5173\u952e\u79d1\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u534f\u540c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e24\u57df\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06\u9891\u7387\u57df\u8bef\u5dee\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u7ea6\u675f\u4e24\u57df\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u8054\u5408\u533a\u57df\u30022. \u8f93\u5165\u57fa\u7840\u538b\u7f29\u5668\uff08\u5982SZ3\u3001ZFP\u3001SPERR\uff09\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u4e24\u57df\u8bef\u5dee\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u6295\u5f71\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bef\u5dee\u5411\u91cf\u6295\u5f71\u81f3\u7a7a\u95f4/\u9891\u7387\u7ea6\u675f\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u76f4\u81f3\u8fdb\u5165\u5176\u4ea4\u96c6\u30023. \u5229\u7528GPU\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u901f\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u3001X\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001\u71c3\u70e7\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u9891\u7387\u57df\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5173\u952e\u79d1\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u6821\u6b63\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u9891\u7387\u57df\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u5728\u4e24\u57df\u534f\u540c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4fdd\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u57df\u5206\u6790\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This study introduces the Intrinsic-Metric Physics-Informed Neural Network (IM-PINN), a mesh-free geometric deep learning framework that solves partial differential equations directly in the continuous parametric domain. By embedding the Riemannian metric tensor into the automatic differentiation graph, our architecture analytically reconstructs the Laplace-Beltrami operator, decoupling solution complexity from geometric discretization. We validate the framework on a \"Stochastic Cloth\" manifold with extreme Gaussian curvature fluctuations ($K \\in [-2489, 3580]$), where traditional adaptive refinement fails to resolve anisotropic Turing instabilities. Using a dual-stream architecture with Fourier feature embeddings to mitigate spectral bias, the IM-PINN recovers the \"splitting spot\" and \"labyrinthine\" regimes of the Gray-Scott model. Benchmarking against the Surface Finite Element Method (SFEM) reveals superior physical rigor: the IM-PINN achieves global mass conservation error of $\\mathcal{E}_{mass} \\approx 0.157$ versus SFEM's $0.258$, acting as a thermodynamically consistent global solver that eliminates mass drift inherent in semi-implicit integration.

Traditional privacy-preserving approaches primarily focus on enhancing database security but fail to address the automatic identification of sensitive information before encryption. This can dramatically reduce query processing time and mitigate errors during manual identification of sensitive information, thereby reducing potential privacy risks. To address this limitation, this research proposes an intelligent privacy-preserving query optimization framework that integrates Named Entity Recognition (NER) to detect sensitive information in queries, utilizing secure data encryption and query optimization techniques for both sensitive and non-sensitive data in parallel, thereby enabling efficient database optimization. Combined deep learning algorithms and transformer-based models to detect and classify sensitive entities with high precision, and the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm to encrypt, with blind indexing to secure search functionality of the sensitive data, whereas non-sensitive data was divided into groups using the K-means algorithm, along with a rank search for optimization. Among all NER models, the Deep Belief Network combined with Long Short-Term Memory (DBN-LSTM) delivers the best performance, with an accuracy of 93% and precision (94%), recall, and F1 score of 93%, and 93%, respectively. Besides, encrypted search achieved considerably faster results with the help of blind indexing, and non-sensitive data fetching also outperformed traditional clustering-based searches.

The traditional machine learning models are effective in pattern recognition, but do not have the adaptive reasoning, situational awareness, and autonomy needed in modern financial operations. As a proposal, this paper presents an Agentic AI framework, or a system where AI agents view the world of dynamic credit independent of human observers, who then make actions based on their articulable decision-making paths. The research introduces a multi-agent system with reinforcing learning, natural language reasoning, explainable AI modules, and real-time data absorption pipelines as a means of assessing the risk profiles of borrowers with few humans being involved. The processes consist of agent collaboration protocol, risk-scoring engines, interpretability layers, and continuous feedback learning cycles. Findings indicate that decision speed, transparency and responsiveness is better than traditional credit scoring models. Nevertheless, there are still some practical limitations such as risks of model drift, inconsistencies in interpreting high dimensional data and regulatory uncertainties as well as infrastructure limitations in low-resource settings. The suggested system has a high prospective to transform credit analytics and future studies ought to be directed on dynamic regulatory compliance mobilizers, new agent teamwork, adversarial robustness, and large-scale implementation in cross-country credit ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Generative recommendation (GR) models can improve quality by consuming long user-behavior sequences, but in production their online sequence length is tightly capped by the ranking-stage P99 budget. We observe that the majority of GR tokens encode user behaviors that are independent of the item candidates, suggesting an opportunity to pre-infer a user-behavior prefix once and reuse it during ranking rather than recomputing it on the critical path. Realizing this idea at industrial scale is non-trivial: the prefix cache must survive across multiple pipeline stages before the final ranking instance is determined, the user population implies cache footprints far beyond a single device, and indiscriminate pre-inference would overload shared resources under high QPS. We present RelayGR, a production system that enables in-HBM relay-race inference for GR. RelayGR selectively pre-infers long-term user prefixes, keeps their KV caches resident in HBM over the request lifecycle, and ensures the subsequent ranking can consume them without remote fetches. RelayGR combines three techniques: 1) a sequence-aware trigger that admits only at-risk requests under a bounded cache footprint and pre-inference load, 2) an affinity-aware router that co-locates cache production and consumption by routing both the auxiliary pre-infer signal and the ranking request to the same instance, and 3) a memory-aware expander that uses server-local DRAM to capture short-term cross-request reuse while avoiding redundant reloads.

This work models per-query control as a small discrete action: choose a retrieval depth and a generation mode (guarded vs. auto), or refuse. An offline logged dataset is constructed from SQuAD 2.0 by executing each action and recording accuracy, token cost, hallucination/refusal indicators, and an SLO-weighted reward. Two simple policy-learning objectives are evaluated: supervised classification of the per-state best action (Argmax-CE) and a reward-weighted variant (Argmax-CE-WT). Across the evaluated settings, a strong fixed baseline (low k, guarded prompting) performs competitively; learned policies mainly provide additional cost savings under a quality-focused SLO and can exhibit refusal collapse under a cheap SLO when refusal is heavily rewarded.

Graph-based indexes achieve state-of-the-art performance on unfiltered ANNS but encounter connectivity breakdown on low-selectivity filtered queries, where qualifying vectors become sparse and the graph structure among them fragments. Recent research proposes specialized graph indexes that address this issue by expanding graph degree, which incurs prohibitively high construction costs. Given these inherent limitations of graph-based methods, we argue for a dual-index architecture and present Curator, a partition-based index that complements existing graph-based approaches for low-selectivity filtered ANNS. Curator builds specialized indexes for different labels within a shared clustering tree, where each index adapts to the distribution of its qualifying vectors to ensure efficient search while sharing structure to minimize memory overhead. The system also supports incremental updates and handles arbitrary complex predicates beyond single-label filters by efficiently constructing temporary indexes on the fly. Our evaluation demonstrates that integrating Curator with state-of-the-art graph indexes reduces low-selectivity query latency by up to 20.9x compared to pre-filtering fallback, while increasing construction time and memory footprint by only 5.5% and 4.3%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The advantage is most pronounced on temporal reasoning: 31.5% vs. 9.3% (RAG) and 5.0% (GraphRAG)--a +530% relative improvement. On multi-hop causal reasoning, CogCanvas achieves 81.0% pass rate vs. 40.0% for GraphRAG (+41.0pp). Controlled benchmarks show 97.5% recall (+78.5pp vs. summarization) with 93.0% exact match preservation.\n  While heavily-optimized approaches achieve higher absolute scores through dedicated training (EverMemOS: approximately 92%), our training-free approach provides practitioners with an immediately-deployable alternative that significantly outperforms standard baselines.

We find that different correct solutions to the same task can show very different memory and performance patterns, which can lead to hidden operational risks. We present a framework to measure execution-time memory stability across multiple correct generations. At the solution level, we introduce Dynamic Mean Pairwise Distance (DMPD), which uses Dynamic Time Warping to compare the shapes of memory-usage traces after converting them into Monotonic Peak Profiles (MPPs) to reduce transient noise. Aggregating DMPD across tasks yields a model-level Model Instability Score (MIS). Experiments on BigOBench and CodeContests show substantial runtime divergence among correct solutions. Instability often increases with higher sampling temperature even when pass@1 improves. We also observe correlations between our stability measures and software engineering indicators such as cognitive and cyclomatic complexity, suggesting links between operational behavior and maintainability.

Such distortions may compromise downstream analyses and lead to incorrect scientific conclusions in applications such as combustion and cosmology. This paper presents a distributed and parallel algorithm for correcting topological features, specifically, piecewise linear Morse Smale segmentations (PLMSS), which decompose the domain into monotone regions labeled by their corresponding local minima and maxima. While a single GPU algorithm (MSz) exists for PLMSS correction after compression, no methodology has been developed that scales beyond a single GPU for extreme scale data. We identify the key bottleneck in scaling PLMSS correction as the parallel computation of integral paths, a communication-intensive computation that is notoriously difficult to scale. Instead of explicitly computing and correcting integral paths, our algorithm simplifies MSz by preserving steepest ascending and descending directions across all locations, thereby minimizing interprocess communication while introducing negligible additional storage overhead. With this simplified algorithm and relaxed synchronization, our method achieves over 90% parallel efficiency on 128 GPUs on the Perlmutter supercomputer for real world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5e76\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6821\u6b63\u538b\u7f29\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\uff08PLMSS\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u6781\u503c\u65b9\u5411\u800c\u975e\u663e\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u79ef\u5206\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff08128 GPU\u6548\u7387>90%\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u6709\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u4f1a\u626d\u66f2\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u71c3\u70e7\u5b66\u3001\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u79d1\u5b66\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5355GPU\u6821\u6b63\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08MSz\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6781\u7aef\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u5728\u4e8e\u79ef\u5206\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5e76\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7b80\u5316MSz\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4e0d\u663e\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6821\u6b63\u79ef\u5206\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6539\u4e3a\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fdd\u7559\u6700\u9661\u4e0a\u5347\u548c\u4e0b\u964d\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8fdb\u7a0b\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4ec5\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u989d\u5916\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5bbd\u677e\u540c\u6b65\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728Perlmutter\u8d85\u7ea7\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528128\u4e2aGPU\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc790%\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u514b\u670d\u4e86PLMSS\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u6269\u5c55\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6781\u7aef\u89c4\u6a21\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u540e\u5904\u7406\u3002"}}

Joint-Embedded Predictive Architectures (JEPA) provide a promising framework to model such dynamics by learning representations and predictors through a self-supervised prediction objective. However, their ability to support effective action planning remains limited. We propose an approach to enhance planning with JEPA world models by shaping their representation space so that the negative goal-conditioned value function for a reaching cost in a given environment is approximated by a distance (or quasi-distance) between state embeddings. We introduce a practical method to enforce this constraint during training and show that it leads to significantly improved planning performance compared to standard JEPA models on simple control tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the scarcity of high-quality spatial natural language query corpora limits the performance of such systems. Existing methods rely on manual knowledge base construction and template-based dynamic generation, which suffer from low construction efficiency and unstable corpus quality. This paper presents semantic-aware spatial corpus construction (SSCC), a tool designed for constructing high-quality spatial natural language query and executable language query pair corpora. SSCC consists of two core modules: (i) a knowledge base construction module based on spatial relations, which extracts and determines spatial relations from datasets, and (ii) a template-augmented query pair corpus generation module, which produces query pairs via template matching and parameter substitution. The tool ensures geometric consistency and adherence to spatial logic in the generated spatial relations. Experimental results demonstrate that SSCC achieves (i) a 53x efficiency improvement for knowledge base construction and (ii) a 2.5x effectiveness improvement for query pair corpus. SSCC provides high-quality corpus support for spatial natural language interface training, substantially reducing both time and labor costs in corpus construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To reduce energy, it is important to choose the right LRM and operate it in the right way. As a result, the performance of systems that dispatch tasks to different individual LRMs depend on the balance between mean energy provisioning and stochastic fluctuations. The critical regime is the unique operating point at which neither auxiliary energy nor baseline energy is systematically wasted. Increasing baseline supply shifts the system toward persistent over-supply and baseline-energy waste, while reducing supply induces persistent reliance on auxiliary energy. Yet in this regime, performance remains volatility-limited and so a second-order characterization provides further insights that we develop. Here, performance is governed by how variability is absorbed across time, models, and execution choices. This perspective highlights variance-aware routing and dispatch as a principled design axis, and provides a theoretical basis for developing energy-aware model routing policies. Routing behavior is characterized when dispatch policies are based on training-compute and inference-compute scaling laws for LRMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e34\u754c\u673a\u5236\u8fd0\u884c\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8def\u7531\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u5e73\u5747\u80fd\u91cf\u4f9b\u5e94\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\u5b58\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5e73\u5747\u80fd\u91cf\u4f9b\u5e94\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u57fa\u7840\u80fd\u6e90\u548c\u8865\u5145\u80fd\u6e90\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6d6a\u8d39\u662f\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8def\u7531\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6267\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u5438\u6536\u3002\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684LRMs\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u4e34\u754c\u673a\u5236\u662f\u9632\u6b62\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u91cf\u6d6a\u8d39\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u64cd\u4f5c\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u53d7\u6ce2\u52a8\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002\u65b9\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u6210\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u80fd\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7ba1\u7406LRM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5176\u8def\u7531\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u6765\u6709\u6548\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Our system consists of four integrated components. (1) a data generation engine constructs geographically grounded simulations using OpenStreetMap data to produce diverse mobility logs. (2) a genetic algorithm-based calibration module fine-tunes simulation parameters to align with real-world mobility characteristics, such as daily trip counts and radius of gyration, enabling realistic behavioral modeling. (3) a data processing suite transforms raw simulation logs into structured formats suitable for downstream applications, including model training and benchmarking. (4) a visualization module extracts key mobility patterns and insights from the processed datasets and presents them through intuitive visual analytics for improved interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing automated untangling methods, particularly state-of-the-art graph clustering-based approaches, are fundamentally limited by two issues. (1) They over-rely on structural information, failing to grasp the crucial semantic intent behind changes, and (2) they operate as ``single-pass'' algorithms, lacking a mechanism for the critical reflection and refinement inherent in human review processes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Atomizer, a novel collaborative multi-agent framework for composite commit untangling. To address the semantic deficit, Atomizer employs an Intent-Oriented Chain-of-Thought (IO-CoT) strategy, which prompts large language models (LLMs) to infer the intent of each code change according to both the structure and the semantic information of code. To overcome the limitations of ``single-pass'' grouping, we employ two agents to establish a grouper-reviewer collaborative refinement loop, which mirrors human review practices by iteratively refining groupings until all changes in a cluster share the same underlying semantic intent. Extensive experiments on two benchmark C# and Java datasets demonstrate that Atomizer significantly outperforms several representative baselines. On average, it surpasses the state-of-the-art graph-based methods by over 6.0% on the C# dataset and 5.5% on the Java dataset.

When database queries fail due to memory overload, it not only wastes critical resources such as CPU time but also disrupts the execution of core business processes, as memory-overloading (MO) queries are typically part of complex workflows. If such queries are identified in advance and scheduled to memory-rich serverless clusters, it can prevent resource wastage and query execution failure. Therefore, cloud data warehouses desire an admission control framework with high prediction precision, interpretability, efficiency, and adaptability to effectively identify MO queries. However, existing admission control frameworks primarily focus on scenarios like SLA satisfaction and resource isolation, with limited precision in identifying MO queries. Moreover, there is a lack of publicly available MO-labeled datasets with workloads for training and benchmarking. To tackle these challenges, we propose SafeLoad, the first query admission control framework specifically designed to identify MO queries. Alongside, we release SafeBench, an open-source, industrial-scale benchmark for this task, which includes 150 million real queries. SafeLoad first filters out memory-safe queries using the interpretable discriminative rule. It then applies a hybrid architecture that integrates both a global model and cluster-level models, supplemented by a misprediction correction module to identify MO queries. Additionally, a self-tuning quota management mechanism dynamically adjusts prediction quotas per cluster to improve precision.

We tested this assumption by embedding hints into questions and measuring whether models mentioned them. In a study of over 9,000 test cases across 11 leading AI models, we found a troubling pattern: models almost never mention hints spontaneously, yet when asked directly, they admit noticing them. This suggests models see influential information but choose not to report it. Telling models they are being watched does not help. Forcing models to report hints works, but causes them to report hints even when none exist and reduces their accuracy. We also found that hints appealing to user preferences are especially dangerous-models follow them most often while reporting them least. These findings suggest that simply watching AI reasoning is not enough to catch hidden influences.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Improper or missing exception handling often leads to severe consequences, including system crashes and resource leaks. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation, they struggle with exception handling at the repository level, due to complex dependencies and contextual constraints. In this work, we propose CatchAll, a novel LLM-based approach for repository-aware exception handling. CatchAll equips LLMs with three complementary layers of exception-handling knowledge: (1) API-level exception knowledge, obtained from an empirically constructed API-exception mapping that characterizes the exception-throwing behaviors of APIs in real-world codebases; (2) repository-level execution context, which captures exception propagation by modeling contextual call traces around the target code; and (3) cross-repository handling knowledge, distilled from reusable exception-handling patterns mined from historical code across projects. The knowledge is encoded into structured prompts to guide the LLM in generating accurate and context-aware exception-handling code. To evaluate CatchAll, we construct two new benchmarks for repository-aware exception handling: a large-scale dataset RepoExEval and an executable subset RepoExEval-Exec. Experiments demonstrate that RepoExEval consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a CodeBLEU score of 0.31 (vs. 0.27% for the best baseline), intent prediction accuracy of 60.1% (vs. 48.0%), and Pass@1 of 29% (vs. 25%). These results affirm RepoExEval's effectiveness in real-world repository-level exception handling.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

By calculating a heterogeneity metric for each client and modulating the perturbation radius inversely to this score, FedSCAM prevents clients with high variance from destabilizing the global model. Furthermore, we introduce a heterogeneity-aware weighted aggregation mechanism that prioritizes updates from clients that align with the global optimization direction.

As vector data scales rapidly, VS faces growing challenges in balancing search, latency, scalability, and cost. The evolution of VS has been closely driven by changes in storage architecture. Early VS methods rely on all-in-memory designs for low latency, but scalability is constrained by memory capacity and cost. To address this, recent research has adopted heterogeneous architectures that offload space-intensive vectors and index structures to SSDs, while exploiting block locality and I/O-efficient strategies to maintain high search performance at billion scale. Looking ahead, the increasing demand for trillion-scale vector retrieval and cloud-native elasticity is driving a further shift toward memory-SSD-object storage architectures, which enable cost-efficient data tiering and seamless scalability.\n  In this tutorial, we review the evolution of VS techniques from a storage-architecture perspective. We first review memory-resident methods, covering classical IVF, hash, quantization, and graph-based designs.

We introduce placement semantics: each strategy is specified by how it places four training states (parameters, optimizer, gradients, activations) across devices using five modes (replicated, sharded, sharded-with-gather, materialized, offloaded). From placement alone, without implementation details, we derive memory consumption and communication volume. Our predictions match published results exactly: ZeRO-3 uses 8x less memory than data parallelism at 1.5x communication cost, as reported in the original paper. We prove two conditions (gradient integrity, state consistency) are necessary and sufficient for distributed training to match single-device results, and provide composition rules for combining strategies safely.

More recently, Google DeepMind has introduced AlphaEarth Foundation (AEF), a GFM pre-trained using multi-source EOs across continuous time. An annual and global embedding dataset is produced using AEF that is ready for analysis and modeling. The internal experiments show that AEF embeddings have outperformed operational models in 15 EO tasks without re-training. However, those experiments are mostly about land cover and land use classification. Applying AEF and other GFMs to agricultural monitoring require an in-depth evaluation in critical agricultural downstream tasks. There is also a lack of comprehensive comparison between the AEF-based models and traditional remote sensing (RS)-based models under different scenarios, which could offer valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners. This study addresses some of these gaps by evaluating AEF embeddings in three agricultural downstream tasks in the U.S., including crop yield prediction, tillage mapping, and cover crop mapping. Datasets are compiled from both public and private sources to comprehensively evaluate AEF embeddings across tasks at different scales and locations, and RS-based models are trained as comparison models. AEF-based models generally exhibit strong performance on all tasks and are competitive with purpose-built RS-based models in yield prediction and county-level tillage mapping when trained on local data. However, we also find several limitations in current AEF embeddings, such as limited spatial transferability compared to RS-based models, low interpretability, and limited time sensitivity. These limitations recommend caution when applying AEF embeddings in agriculture, where time sensitivity, generalizability, and interpretability is important.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To enable real-time analytics under limited computational, memory, and communication resources, matrix sketching techniques have been developed over recent decades to provide compact approximations of such streaming data. Some algorithms have achieved optimal space and communication complexity. However, these approaches often require frequent time-consuming matrix factorization operations. In particular, under tight approximation error bounds, each matrix factorization computation incurs cubic time complexity, thereby limiting their update efficiency.\n  In this paper, we introduce AeroSketch, a novel matrix sketching framework that leverages recent advances in randomized numerical linear algebra (RandNLA). AeroSketch achieves optimal communication and space costs while delivering near-optimal update time complexity (within logarithmic factors) across persistent, sliding window, and distributed streaming scenarios. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that AeroSketch consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in update throughput. In particular, under tight approximation error constraints, AeroSketch reduces the cubic time complexity to the quadratic level. Meanwhile, it maintains comparable approximation quality while retaining optimal communication and space costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Yu"], "title": "Enhancing Temporal Awareness in LLMs for Temporal Point Processes", "comment": "preprint", "summary": "Temporal point processes (TPPs) are crucial for analyzing events over time and are widely used in fields such as finance, healthcare, and social systems. These processes are particularly valuable for understanding how events unfold over time, accounting for their irregularity and dependencies. Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in sequence modeling, applying them to temporal point processes remains challenging. A key issue is that current methods struggle to effectively capture the complex interaction between temporal information and semantic context, which is vital for accurate event modeling. In this context, we introduce TPP-TAL (Temporal Point Processes with Enhanced Temporal Awareness in LLMs), a novel plug-and-play framework designed to enhance temporal reasoning within LLMs. Rather than using the conventional method of simply concatenating event time and type embeddings, TPP-TAL explicitly aligns temporal dynamics with contextual semantics before feeding this information into the LLM. This alignment allows the model to better perceive temporal dependencies and long-range interactions between events and their surrounding contexts. Through comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, it is shown that TPP-TAL delivers substantial improvements in temporal likelihood estimation and event prediction accuracy, highlighting the importance of enhancing temporal awareness in LLMs for continuous-time event modeling.

The use of linear models limits the performance and applicability of MPC for processes that span a wide range of operating conditions.

As a step towards making NMPC more practical for hierarchical systems, we introduce Gly-coPy, an equation-oriented, object-oriented software framework for process modeling, opti-mization, and NMPC in Python. GlycoPy enables users to focus on writing equations for modeling while supporting hierarchical modeling. GlycoPy includes algorithms for parame-ter estimation, dynamic optimization, and NMPC, and allows users to customize the simula-tion, optimization, and control algorithms. Three case studies, ranging from a simple differ-ential algebraic equation system to a multiscale bioprocess model, validate the modeling, optimization, and NMPC capabilities of GlycoPy.

We prove that dissipative quantum dynamics with analytically tractable non-local context aggregation produce coherent text generation, while conservation laws cause fundamental failure. Employing Koopman operators with closed-form path integral propagators, we show irreversible computation fundamentally requires both controlled information dissipation and causal context aggregation. Spectral analysis reveals emergent eigenvalue structure, separating into decay modes (forgetting), growth modes (amplification), and neutral modes (preservation) -- the essential ingredients for directed information flow. Hamiltonian constraints force the elimination of these dissipative modes and degrading performance despite unchanged model capacity. This establishes language generation as dissipative quantum field theory, proving mechanical systems acquire intelligence through the combination of dissipation and non-locality, not through conservation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8017\u6563\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u95ed\u5f0f\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u4f20\u64ad\u5b50\u7684 Koopman \u7b97\u5b50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u667a\u80fd\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u8ba1\u7b97\u2014\u5373\u53d7\u63a7\u4fe1\u606f\u8017\u6563\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u8bed\u5883\u805a\u5408\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8017\u6563\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u7eaf\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u667a\u80fd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\u662f\u5426\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u4f9d\u8d56\u8017\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u8bed\u5883\u805a\u5408\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u4ee5\u6784\u9020\u5177\u6709\u5185\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u6d41\u7684\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8017\u6563\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684 Koopman \u7b97\u5b50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u95ed\u5f0f\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u4f20\u64ad\u5b50\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u6790\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u8bed\u5883\u805a\u5408\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u8fa8\u8bc6\u8870\u51cf\u3001\u589e\u957f\u548c\u4e2d\u6027\u672c\u5f81\u6a21\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4ee5\u7a81\u51fa\u8017\u6563\u7684\u5fc5\u9700\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8017\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u800c\u4ec5\u9075\u5faa\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u786e\u8bc1\u667a\u80fd\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8017\u6563\u4e0e\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u8bed\u5883\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5b88\u6052\u539f\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8017\u6563\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08\u4fe1\u606f\u8017\u6563\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u8bed\u5883\u805a\u5408\uff09\u662f\u667a\u80fd\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7eaf\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u83b7\u5f97\u5b9e\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u901a\u8fc7\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002"}}

Existing data discovery systems assume that each question can be answered by a single table and often rely on resource-intensive offline preprocessing, such as model training or large-scale content indexing. In practice, however, many questions require information spread across multiple tables -- either independently or through joins -- and users often seek specific cell values rather than entire tables. In this paper, we present Octopus, a lightweight, entity-aware, and training-free system for multi-table data discovery and cell-level value retrieval. Instead of embedding entire questions, Octopus identifies fine-grained entities (column mentions and value mentions) from natural-language queries using an LLM parser. It then matches these entities to table headers through a compact embedding index and scans table contents directly for value occurrences, eliminating the need for heavy content indexing or costly offline stages. The resulting fine-grained alignment not only improves table retrieval accuracy but also facilitates efficient downstream NL2SQL execution by reducing token usage and redundant LLM calls. To evaluate Octopus, we introduce a new benchmark covering both table- and cell-level discovery under multi-table settings, including five datasets for independent discovery and two for join-based discovery. Experimental results show that Octopus consistently outperforms existing systems while achieving substantially lower computational and token costs.

In contrast to prevalent methods that rely on complex training paradigms (e.g., mid-training, SFT, reinforcement learning, and their combinations), we explore how to push the limits of a lightweight SFT-only approach for SWE tasks. SWE-Lego comprises three core building blocks, with key findings summarized as follows: 1) the SWE-Lego dataset, a collection of 32k highquality task instances and 18k validated trajectories, combining real and synthetic data to complement each other in both quality and quantity; 2) a refined SFT procedure with error masking and a difficulty-based curriculum, which demonstrably improves action quality and overall performance.

However, the strong heterogeneity across cell chemistries, form factors, and operating conditions makes it difficult to build a single model that generalizes beyond its training domain. This work proposes a unified capacity forecasting framework that maintains robust performance across diverse chemistries and usage scenarios. We curate 20 public aging datasets into a large-scale corpus covering 1,704 cells and 3,961,195 charge-discharge cycle segments, spanning temperatures from $-5\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to $45\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, multiple C-rates, and application-oriented profiles such as fast charging and partial cycling. On this corpus, we adopt a Time-Series Foundation Model (TSFM) backbone and apply parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) together with physics-guided contrastive representation learning to capture shared degradation patterns. Experiments on both seen and deliberately held-out unseen datasets show that a single unified model achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with strong per-dataset baselines, while retaining stable performance on chemistries, capacity scales, and operating conditions excluded from training. These results demonstrate the potential of TSFM-based architectures as a scalable and transferable solution for capacity degradation forecasting in real battery management systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While prior studies have explored factors influencing review velocity, the role of the review assignment process, particularly the `group review request', is unclear. In group review requests, available on platforms like Phabricator, GitHub, and Bitbucket, a code change is assigned to a reviewer group, allowing any member to review it, unlike individual review assignments to specific reviewers. Drawing parallels with shared task queues in Management Sciences, this study examines the effects of group versus individual review requests on velocity and quality. We investigate approximately 66,000 revisions in the Mozilla Firefox project, combining statistical modeling with practitioner views from a focus group discussion. Our study associates group reviews with improved review quality, characterized by fewer regressions, while having a negligible association with review velocity.

Existing methods enhance model compatibility with data heterogeneity by splitting models and knowledge distillation. However, they neglect the insufficient communication bandwidth and computing power on the client, failing to strike an effective balance between addressing data heterogeneity and accommodating limited client resources. To tackle this limitation, we propose a personalized federated learning method based on cosine sparsification parameter packing and dual-weighted aggregation (FedCSPACK), which effectively leverages the limited client resources and reduces the impact of data heterogeneity on model performance. In FedCSPACK, the client packages model parameters and selects the most contributing parameter packages for sharing based on cosine similarity, effectively reducing bandwidth requirements. The client then generates a mask matrix anchored to the shared parameter package to improve the alignment and aggregation efficiency of sparse updates on the server. Furthermore, directional and distribution distance weights are embedded in the mask to implement a weighted-guided aggregation mechanism, enhancing the robustness and generalization performance of the global model. Extensive experiments across four datasets using ten state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that FedCSPACK effectively improves communication and computational efficiency while maintaining high model accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Across proteins, spider webs and flame dynamics, vibrational and architectural principles recur as tonal hierarchies, harmonic progressions, and long-range musical form. Using reversible mappings, from molecular spectra to musical tones and from three-dimensional networks to playable instruments, we show how sound functions as a scientific probe, an epistemic inversion where listening becomes a mode of seeing and musical composition becomes a blueprint for matter. These mappings excavate deep time: patterns originating in femtosecond molecular vibrations or billion-year evolutionary histories become audible. We posit that novelty in science and art emerges when constraints cannot be satisfied within existing degrees of freedom, forcing expansion of the space of viable configurations. Selective imperfection provides the mechanism restoring balance between coherence and adaptability. Quantitative support comes from exhaustive enumeration of all 2^12 musical scales, revealing that culturally significant systems cluster in a mid-entropy, mid-defect corridor, directly paralleling the Hall-Petch optimum where intermediate defect densities maximize material strength. Iterating these mappings creates productive collisions between human creativity and physics, generating new information as musical structures encounter evolutionary constraints. We show how swarm-based AI models compose music exhibiting human-like structural signatures such as small-world connectivity, modular integration, long-range coherence, suggesting a route beyond interpolation toward invention. We show that science and art are generative acts of world-building under constraint, with vibration as a shared grammar organizing structure across scales.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Consider the task of predicting the political preferences of users in a social network; to solve this task one should consider, both, the features of each individual user and the relationships between them. However, oftentimes one is not interested in the label of a single instance but rather in the distribution of labels over a set of instances; e.g., when predicting the political preferences of users, the overall prevalence of a given opinion might be of higher interest than the opinion of a specific person. This label prevalence estimation task is commonly referred to as quantification learning (QL). Current QL methods for tabular data are typically based on the so-called prior probability shift (PPS) assumption which states that the label-conditional instance distributions should remain equal across the training and test data. In the graph setting, PPS generally does not hold if the shift between training and test data is structural, i.e., if the training data comes from a different region of the graph than the test data. To address such structural shifts, an importance sampling variant of the popular adjusted count quantification approach has previously been proposed. In this work, we extend the idea of structural importance sampling to the state-of-the-art KDEy quantification approach. We show that our proposed method adapts to structural shifts and outperforms standard quantification approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, manual issue assignment is often inconsistent and error-prone, especially in large open-source projects where thousands of new issues are reported monthly. Existing automated approaches have shown promise, but many rely heavily on large volumes of project-specific training data or relational information that is often sparse and noisy, which limits their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose LIA (LLM-based Issue Assignment), which employs supervised fine-tuning to adapt an LLM, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B in this work, for automatic issue assignment. By leveraging the LLM's pretrained semantic understanding of natural language and software-related text, LIA learns to generate ranked developer recommendations directly from issue titles and descriptions. The ranking is based on the model's learned understanding of historical issue-to-developer assignments, using patterns from past tasks to infer which developers are most likely to handle new issues. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that LIA delivers substantial improvements over both its base pretrained model and state-of-the-art baselines. It achieves up to +187.8% higher Hit@1 compared to the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B pretrained base model, and outperforms four leading issue assignment methods by as much as +211.2% in Hit@1 score.

The method produces an initial reasoning trace, formulates targeted questions that challenge potential failure points, and generates alternative reasoning trajectories that expose incorrect assumptions or invalid steps. These counterfactual trajectories provide structured relative feedback that can be directly used for policy optimization without auxiliary models.

This study creates and tests a Machine Learning Canvas, a practical framework that combines business strategy, software engineering, and data science in order to determine the factors that lead to the success of ML projects. We surveyed 150 data scientists and analyzed their responses using statistical modeling. We identified four key success factors: Strategy (clear goals and planning), Process (how work gets done), Ecosystem (tools and infrastructure), and Support (organizational backing and resources). Our results show that these factors are interconnected - each one affects the next.

Its architecture separates strategic, tactical, and communication functions for clarity and scalability. At the strategic level, a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent, trained in a high-fidelity simulation of New Yorks Citi Bike network, learns robust rebalancing policies by modelling the challenge as a Markov Decision Process. These high-level strategies feed into a deterministic tactical module that optimises multi-leg journeys and schedules just-in-time dispatches to minimise fleet travel. Evaluation across multiple seeded runs demonstrates SmartFlows high efficacy, reducing network imbalance by over 95% while requiring minimal travel distance and achieving strong truck utilisation. A communication layer, powered by a grounded Agentic AI with a Large Language Model (LLM), translates logistical plans into clear, actionable instructions for operational staff, ensuring interpretability and execution readiness. This integration bridges machine intelligence with human operations, offering a scalable solution that reduces idle time, improves bike availability, and lowers operational costs. SmartFlow provides a blueprint for interpretable, AI-driven logistics in complex urban mobility networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We study ICL in a linear transformer with tied weights trained on linear regression tasks, and show that minimising the in-context loss leads to a phase transition in the learned parameters. Above a critical context length, the solution develops a skew-symmetric component. We prove this by reducing the forward pass of the linear transformer under weight tying to preconditioned gradient descent, and then analysing the optimal preconditioner. This preconditioner includes a skew-symmetric component, which induces a rotation of the gradient direction. For model collapse, we use martingale and random walk theory to analyse simplified settings - linear regression and Gaussian fitting - under both replacing and cumulative data regimes. We strengthen existing results by proving almost sure convergence, showing that collapse occurs unless the data grows sufficiently fast or is retained over time. Finally, we introduce the notion of context collapse: a degradation of context during long generations, especially in chain-of-thought reasoning. This concept links the dynamics of ICL with long-term stability challenges in generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This study investigates quantum machine learning approaches for detecting coordinated stealth attacks on a distributed generation unit in a microgrid. High-quality simulated measurements were used to create a balanced binary classification dataset using three features: reactive power at DG1, frequency deviation relative to the nominal value, and terminal voltage magnitude. Classical machine learning baselines, fully quantum variational classifiers, and hybrid quantum classical models were evaluated. The results show that a hybrid quantum classical model combining quantum feature embeddings with a classical RBF support vector machine achieves the best overall performance on this low dimensional dataset, with a modest improvement in accuracy and F1 score over a strong classical SVM baseline. Fully quantum models perform worse due to training instability and limitations of current NISQ hardware. In contrast, hybrid models train more reliably and demonstrate that quantum feature mapping can enhance intrusion detection even when fully quantum learning is not yet practical.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u53d1\u7535\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u9690\u853d\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u5d4c\u5165+\u7ecf\u5178RBF SVM\uff09\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u7565\u5fae\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5b8c\u5168\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u56e0NISQ\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u534f\u8c03\u9690\u853d\u653b\u51fb\u4f1a\u4fee\u6539\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f46\u4f2a\u88c5\u6210\u6b63\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u53d1\u7535\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u65b0\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542bDG1\u65e0\u529f\u529f\u7387\u3001\u9891\u7387\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u7aef\u7535\u538b\u5e45\u503c\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u7ecf\u5178\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u91cf\u5b50\u53d8\u5206\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178RBF SVM\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u7ecf\u5178SVM\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u5b8c\u5168\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548cNISQ\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u5f53\u524dNISQ\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u800c\u5b8c\u5168\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u5c1a\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u786c\u4ef6\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u6216\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

To this end, we will perform a large-scale analysis on 157.7k potential OSS repositories, employing repository metrics and software metrics to compare projects adopting AI libraries against those that do not.

This paper presents LLMize, an open-source Python framework that enables LLM-driven optimization through iterative prompting and in-context learning. LLMize formulates optimization as a black-box process in which candidate solutions are generated in natural language, evaluated by an external objective function, and refined over successive iterations using solution-score feedback. The framework supports multiple optimization strategies, including Optimization by Prompting (OPRO) and hybrid LLM-based methods inspired by evolutionary algorithms and simulated annealing. A key advantage of LLMize is the ability to inject constraints, rules, and domain knowledge directly through natural language descriptions, allowing practitioners to define complex optimization problems without requiring expertise in mathematical programming or metaheuristic design. LLMize is evaluated on convex optimization, linear programming, the Traveling Salesman Problem, neural network hyperparameter tuning, and nuclear fuel lattice optimization. Results show that while LLM-based optimization is not competitive with classical solvers for simple problems, it provides a practical and accessible approach for complex, domain-specific tasks where constraints and heuristics are difficult to formalize.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, at each hop, large language models (LLMs) retrieve subgraphs with numerous temporally similar and semantically complex relations, increasing the risk of suboptimal decisions and error propagation. To address these challenges, we propose the multi-hop reasoning enhanced (MRE) framework, which enhances both forward and backward reasoning to improve the identification of globally optimal reasoning trajectories. Specifically, MRE begins with prompt engineering to guide the LLM in generating diverse reasoning trajectories for a given question. Valid reasoning trajectories are then selected for supervised fine-tuning, serving as a cold-start strategy. Finally, we introduce Tree-Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO), a recursive, tree-structured learning-by-exploration approach. At each hop, exploration establishes strong causal dependencies on the previous hop, while evaluation is informed by multi-path exploration feedback from subsequent hops. Experimental results on two TKGQA benchmarks indicate that the proposed MRE-based model consistently surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in handling complex multi-hop queries.

However, what constitutes a \"defect\" is inherently context-dependent and varies across projects, domains, and stakeholder interpretations. In this paper, we propose a Human-LLM Collaboration (HLC) approach that treats defect prediction as an adaptive process rather than a static classification task. HLC leverages LLM Chain-of-Thought reasoning in a feedback loop: users validate predictions alongside their explanations, and these validated examples adaptively guide future predictions through few-shot learning. We evaluate this approach using the weak word smell on the QuRE benchmark of 1,266 annotated Mercedes-Benz requirements. Our results show that HLC effectively adapts to the provision of validated examples, with rapid performance gains from as few as 20 validated examples. Incorporating validated explanations, not just labels, enables HLC to substantially outperform both standard few-shot prompting and fine-tuned BERT models while maintaining high recall. These results highlight how the in-context and Chain-of-Thought learning capabilities of LLMs enable adaptive classification approaches that move beyond one-size-fits-all models, creating opportunities for tools that learn continuously from stakeholder feedback.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The advantage of RMCTS over AlphaZero's MCTS-UCB is speed. In RMCTS, the search tree is explored in a breadth-first manner, so that network inferences naturally occur in large batches. This significantly reduces the GPU latency cost. We find that RMCTS is often more than 40 times faster than MCTS-UCB when searching a single root state, and about 3 times faster when searching a large batch of root states.\n  The recursion in RMCTS is based on computing optimized posterior policies at each game state in the search tree, starting from the leaves and working back up to the root. Here we use the posterior policy explored in \"Monte--Carlo tree search as regularized policy optimization\" (Grill, et al.) Their posterior policy is the unique policy which maximizes the expected reward given estimated action rewards minus a penalty for diverging from the prior policy.\n  The tree explored by RMCTS is not defined in an adaptive manner, as it is in MCTS-UCB. Instead, the RMCTS tree is defined by following prior network policies at each node. This is a disadvantage, but the speedup advantage is more significant, and in practice we find that RMCTS-trained networks match the quality of MCTS-UCB-trained networks in roughly one-third of the training time. We include timing and quality comparisons of RMCTS vs. MCTS-UCB for three games: Connect-4, Dots-and-Boxes, and Othello.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this gap, we conducted a two-phase empirical study. First, we analyzed nearly 300 papers published at the top-3 SE conferences since 2022 to assess how prompt design, testing, and optimization are currently reported. Second, we surveyed 105 program committee members from these conferences to capture their expectations for prompt reporting in LLM-driven research. Based on the findings, we derived a structured guideline that distinguishes essential, desirable, and exceptional reporting elements.

In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by evaluating 100 replication packages published as part of ICSE proceedings over the past decade (2015--2024). We assess the (1) executability of the replication packages, (2) efforts and modifications required to execute them, (3) challenges that prevent executability, and (4) reproducibility of the original findings. We spent approximately 650 person-hours in total executing the artifacts and reproducing the study findings.

On ill-conditioned convex quadratics and in a small PINN warm-start suite (Burgers and Allen--Cahn), the default FANoS configuration underperforms AdamW and can be unstable or high-variance.\n  Overall, the evidence supports a conservative conclusion: FANoS is an interpretable synthesis of existing ideas that can help on some stiff nonconvex valleys, but it is not a generally superior replacement for modern baselines, and its behavior is sensitive to temperature-schedule and hyperparameter choices.", "AI": {"tldr": "FANoS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e8c\u9636\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001Nos\u00e9\u2013Hoover\u70ed\u6d74\u53d8\u91cf\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u8f9b\u6b27\u62c9\u79ef\u5206\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u975e\u51f8\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u526a\u88c1AdamW\u548cSGD\uff0c\u4f46\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u53ca\u526a\u88c1AdamW\u548cL-BFGS\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f", "motivation": "\u5c06\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u79ef\u5206\u548c\u70ed\u6d74\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u5ff5\u5f15\u5165\u4f18\u5316\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u6765\u5904\u7406\u975e\u51f8\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u521a\u6027\u5c71\u8c37\u548c\u75c5\u6001\u5730\u5f62", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\uff1a(1)\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u9636\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c(2)\u7c7b\u4f3cNos\u00e9\u2013Hoover\u7684\u70ed\u6d74\u53d8\u91cf\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u80fd\u53cd\u9988\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282\u6807\u91cf\u6469\u64e6\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c(3)\u534a\u9690\u5f0f(\u8f9b\u6b27\u62c9)\u79ef\u5206\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u9009\u5bf9\u89d2RMS\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5b50", "result": "\u5728Rosenbrock-100D\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFANoS-RMS(1.74\u00d710\u207b\u00b2)\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u526a\u88c1AdamW(48.50)\u548cSGD+momentum(90.76)\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u53ca\u526a\u88c1AdamW(1.87\u00d710\u207b\u00b3)\u548cL-BFGS(\u22484.4\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2070)\uff1b\u5728\u75c5\u6001\u51f8\u4e8c\u6b21\u95ee\u9898\u548cPINN\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6b20\u4f73\u4e14\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a", "conclusion": "FANoS\u662f\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u5ff5\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u521a\u6027\u975e\u51f8\u5c71\u8c37\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u901a\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u6e29\u5ea6\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u9700\u4fdd\u5b88\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u9002\u7528\u6027"}}

In this work, we explore collective intelligence as an alternative to monolithic scaling, and demonstrate that open-source LLMs' collaboration can surpass Gemini-3-Pro. We first revisit LLM routing and aggregation at scale and identify three key bottlenecks: (1) current train-free routers are limited by a query-based paradigm focusing solely on textual similarity; (2) recent aggregation methods remain largely static, failing to select appropriate aggregators for different tasks;(3) the complementarity of routing and aggregation remains underutilized. To address these problems, we introduce JiSi, a novel framework designed to release the full potential of LLMs' collaboration through three innovations: (1) Query-Response Mixed Routing capturing both semantic information and problem difficulty; (2) Support-Set-based Aggregator Selection jointly evaluating the aggregation and domain capacity of aggregators; (3) Adaptive Routing-Aggregation Switch dynamically leveraging the advantages of routing and aggregation. Comprehensive experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate that JiSi can surpass Gemini-3-Pro with only 47% costs by orchestrating ten open-source LLMs, while outperforming mainstream baselines. It suggests that collective intelligence represents a novel path towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We find a meaningful association between CodeHealth, a quality metric calibrated for human comprehension, and semantic preservation after AI refactoring. Our findings confirm that human-friendly code is also more compatible with AI tooling. These results suggest that organizations can use CodeHealth to guide where AI interventions are lower risk and where additional human oversight is warranted.

While AI models have achieved notable success across various scientific domains, they typically remain domain-specific or lack the capability of simultaneously understanding and generating multimodal scientific data, particularly for high-dimensional data. Yet, many pressing global challenges and scientific problems are inherently cross-disciplinary and require coordinated progress across multiple fields. Here, we present FuXi-Uni, a native unified multimodal model for scientific understanding and high-fidelity generation across scientific domains within a single architecture. Specifically, FuXi-Uni aligns cross-disciplinary scientific tokens within natural language tokens and employs science decoder to reconstruct scientific tokens, thereby supporting both natural language conversation and scientific numerical prediction. Empirically, we validate FuXi-Uni in Earth science and Biomedicine. In Earth system modeling, the model supports global weather forecasting, tropical cyclone (TC) forecast editing, and spatial downscaling driven by only language instructions. FuXi-Uni generates 10-day global forecasts at 0.25\u00b0 resolution that outperform the SOTA physical forecasting system. It shows superior performance for both TC track and intensity prediction relative to the SOTA physical model, and generates high-resolution regional weather fields that surpass standard interpolation baselines. Regarding biomedicine, FuXi-Uni outperforms leading multimodal large language models on multiple biomedical visual question answering benchmarks. By unifying heterogeneous scientific modalities within a native shared latent space while maintaining strong domain-specific performance, FuXi-Uni provides a step forward more general-purpose, multimodal scientific models.", "AI": {"tldr": "FuXi-Uni\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u751f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u79d1\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u64c5\u957f\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u6c14\u8c61\u5b66\u548c\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u9700\u8981\u6574\u5408\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709AI\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u540c\u65f6\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u5168\u7403\u6027\u6311\u6218\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8de8\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "method": "FuXi-Uni\u5c06\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u79d1\u5b66\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6807\u8bb0\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u79d1\u5b66\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u91cd\u6784\u79d1\u5b66\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u65e2\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e5f\u652f\u6301\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u503c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u67b6\u6784\u7edf\u4e00\u5f02\u6784\u79d1\u5b66\u6a21\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5730\u7403\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\uff0cFuXi-Uni\u652f\u6301\u5168\u7403\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u3001\u70ed\u5e26\u6c14\u65cb\u9884\u6d4b\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u768410\u5929\u5168\u74030.25\u00b0\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9884\u62a5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7269\u7406\u9884\u62a5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u70ed\u5e26\u6c14\u65cb\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u533a\u57df\u6c14\u8c61\u573a\u8d85\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u63d2\u503c\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7\u9886\u5148\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "FuXi-Uni\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5f02\u6784\u79d1\u5b66\u6a21\u6001\u7edf\u4e00\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u751f\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u79d1\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, effectively training large diffusion policies using reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging. Existing methods either suffer from unstable training due to directly maximizing value objectives, or face computational issues due to relying on crude Gaussian likelihood approximation, which requires a large amount of sufficiently small denoising steps. In this work, we propose DIPOLE (Dichotomous diffusion Policy improvement), a novel RL algorithm designed for stable and controllable diffusion policy optimization. We begin by revisiting the KL-regularized objective in RL, which offers a desirable weighted regression objective for diffusion policy extraction, but often struggles to balance greediness and stability. We then formulate a greedified policy regularization scheme, which naturally enables decomposing the optimal policy into a pair of stably learned dichotomous policies: one aims at reward maximization, and the other focuses on reward minimization. Under such a design, optimized actions can be generated by linearly combining the scores of dichotomous policies during inference, thereby enabling flexible control over the level of greediness.Evaluations in offline and offline-to-online RL settings on ExORL and OGBench demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We also use DIPOLE to train a large vision-language-action (VLA) model for end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) and evaluate it on the large-scale real-world AD benchmark NAVSIM, highlighting its potential for complex real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, compared with large language models, SLMs are more prone to factual hallucinations in reasoning and exhibit weaker classification performance. This raises a natural question: Can mitigating factual hallucinations improve SLMs' financial classification? To address this, we propose a three-step pipeline named AAAI (Association Identification, Automated Detection, and Adaptive Inference). Experiments on three representative SLMs reveal that: (1) factual hallucinations are positively correlated with misclassifications; (2) encoder-based verifiers effectively detect factual hallucinations; and (3) incorporating feedback on factual errors enables SLMs' adaptive inference that enhances classification performance. We hope this pipeline contributes to trustworthy and effective applications of SLMs in finance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aAAAI\u7684\u4e09\u6b65\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(SLMs)\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u548c\u672c\u5730\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u800c\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cSLMs\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e14\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u8ba8\u7f13\u89e3\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5e7b\u89c9\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6539\u5584SLMs\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aAAAI\u7684\u4e09\u6b65\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff1a\u5173\u8054\u8bc6\u522b(Association Identification)\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b(Automated Detection)\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406(Adaptive Inference)\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7f13\u89e3SLMs\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a(1) \u4e8b\u5b9e\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff1b(2) \u7f16\u7801\u5668\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5e7b\u89c9\uff1b(3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u4f7fSLMs\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4fc3\u8fdbSLMs\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

We study this using COVID-19 as a natural experiment across 8 supply chain tasks. Despite identical severe feature turnover (Jaccard approximately 0), coverage drops vary from 0% to 86.7%, spanning two orders of magnitude. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis, we find catastrophic failures correlate with single-feature dependence (rho = 0.714, p = 0.047). Catastrophic tasks concentrate importance in one feature (4.5x increase), while robust tasks redistribute across many (10-20x). Quarterly retraining restores catastrophic task coverage from 22% to 41% (+19 pp, p = 0.04), but provides no benefit for robust tasks (99.8% coverage). Exploratory analysis of 4 additional tasks with moderate feature stability (Jaccard 0.13-0.86) reveals feature stability, not concentration, determines robustness, suggesting concentration effects apply specifically to severe shifts.

Question answering over documents from multi-release systems poses challenges because different releases have distinct yet overlapping documentation. Motivated by the observed inaccuracy of state-of-the-art question-answering techniques on multi-release system documents, we propose QAMR, a chatbot designed to answer questions across multi-release system documentation. QAMR enhances traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ensure accuracy in the face of highly similar yet distinct documentation for different releases. It achieves this through a novel combination of pre-processing, query rewriting, and context selection. In addition, QAMR employs a dual-chunking strategy to enable separately tuned chunk sizes for retrieval and answer generation, improving overall question-answering accuracy. We evaluate QAMR using a public software-engineering benchmark as well as a collection of real-world, multi-release system documents from our industry partner, Ciena. Our evaluation yields five main findings: (1) QAMR outperforms a baseline RAG-based chatbot, achieving an average answer correctness of 88.5% and an average retrieval accuracy of 90%, which correspond to improvements of 16.5% and 12%, respectively. (2) An ablation study shows that QAMR's mechanisms for handling multi-release documents directly improve answer accuracy. (3) Compared to its component-ablated variants, QAMR achieves a 19.6% average gain in answer correctness and a 14.0% average gain in retrieval accuracy over the best ablation. (4) QAMR reduces response time by 8% on average relative to the baseline.

We study a generative modeling approach for producing new realizations from a limited set of available runs by transferring structure learned across an ensemble. Using monthly near-surface temperature time series from ten independent reanalysis realizations (ERA5), we find that a vanilla conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) trained jointly across realizations yields a fragmented latent space that fails to generalize to unseen ensemble members. To address this, we introduce a latent-constrained CVAE (LC-CVAE) that enforces cross-realization homogeneity of latent embeddings at a small set of shared geographic 'anchor' locations. We then use multi-output Gaussian process regression in the latent space to predict latent coordinates at unsampled locations in a new realization, followed by decoding to generate full time series fields. Experiments and ablations demonstrate (i) instability when training on a single realization, (ii) diminishing returns after incorporating roughly five realizations, and (iii) a trade-off between spatial coverage and reconstruction quality that is closely linked to the average neighbor distance in latent space.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While traditional econometric methods struggle when these confounders are orthogonal to structured covariates, high-dimensional unstructured text often contains rich proxies for these latent variables. This study proposes a Neural Network-Enhanced Double Machine Learning (DML) framework designed to leverage text embeddings for causal identification. Using a rigorous synthetic benchmark, we demonstrate that unstructured text embeddings capture critical confounding information that is absent from structured tabular data. However, we show that standard tree-based DML estimators retain substantial bias (+24%) due to their inability to model the continuous topology of embedding manifolds. In contrast, our deep learning approach reduces bias to -0.86% with optimized architectures, effectively recovering the ground-truth causal parameter. These findings suggest that deep learning architectures are essential for satisfying the unconfoundedness assumption when conditioning on high-dimensional natural language data", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, despite its power, the standard attention mechanism is plagued by well-documented issues: representational collapse and attention sink. Although prior work has proposed approaches for these issues, they are often studied in isolation, obscuring their deeper connection. In this paper, we present a unified perspective, arguing that both can be traced to a common root -- improper attention allocation. We identify two failure modes: 1) Attention Overload, where tokens receive comparable high weights, blurring semantic features that lead to representational collapse; 2) Attention Underload, where no token is semantically relevant, yet attention is still forced to distribute, resulting in spurious focus such as attention sink. Building on this insight, we introduce Lazy Attention, a novel mechanism designed for a more focused attention distribution. To mitigate overload, it employs positional discrimination across both heads and dimensions to sharpen token distinctions. To counteract underload, it incorporates Elastic-Softmax, a modified normalization function that relaxes the standard softmax constraint to suppress attention on irrelevant tokens. Experiments on the FineWeb-Edu corpus, evaluated across nine diverse benchmarks, demonstrate that Lazy Attention successfully mitigates attention sink and achieves competitive performance compared to both standard attention and modern architectures, while reaching up to 59.58% attention sparsity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Game-based assessment offers a promising alternative by capturing implicit behavioral signals during gameplay. This study proposes a multi-genre serious-game framework combined with machine-learning techniques to predict suitability for software development roles. Developer-relevant personality and behavioral traits were identified through a systematic literature review and an empirical study of professional software engineers. A custom mobile game was designed to elicit behaviors related to problem solving, planning, adaptability, persistence, time management, and information seeking. Fine-grained gameplay event data were collected and analyzed using a two-phase modeling strategy where suitability was predicted exclusively from gameplay-derived behavioral features. Results show that our model achieved up to 97% precision and 94% accuracy. Behavioral analysis revealed that proper candidates exhibited distinct gameplay patterns, such as more wins in puzzle-based games, more side challenges, navigating menus more frequently, and exhibiting fewer pauses, retries, and surrender actions.

However, existing approaches often struggle to balance efficiency, scalability, and accuracy, particularly when handling long-range dependencies and irregularly sampled data. To address these challenges, we propose MODE, a unified framework that integrates Low-Rank Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) with an Enhanced Mamba architecture. As illustrated in our framework, the input sequence is first transformed by a Linear Tokenization Layer and then processed through multiple Mamba Encoder blocks, each equipped with an Enhanced Mamba Layer that employs Causal Convolution, SiLU activation, and a Low-Rank Neural ODE enhancement to efficiently capture temporal dynamics. This low-rank formulation reduces computational overhead while maintaining expressive power. Furthermore, a segmented selective scanning mechanism, inspired by pseudo-ODE dynamics, adaptively focuses on salient subsequences to improve scalability and long-range sequence modeling. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MODE surpasses existing baselines in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Overall, our contributions include: (1) a unified and efficient architecture for long-term time series modeling, (2) integration of Mamba's selective scanning with low-rank Neural ODEs for enhanced temporal representation, and (3) substantial improvements in efficiency and scalability enabled by low-rank approximation and dynamic selective scanning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This motivates predictive modelling of muscle outcomes from minimally invasive biomarkers that can be acquired longitudinally. We study a small-sample preclinical dataset comprising 213 animals across two conditions (Sham versus cigarette-smoke exposure), with blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid measurements and three continuous targets: tibialis anterior muscle weight (milligram: mg), specific force (millinewton: mN), and a derived muscle quality index (mN per mg). We benchmark tuned classical baselines, geometry-aware symmetric positive definite (SPD) descriptors with Stein divergence, and quantum kernel models designed for low-dimensional tabular data. In the muscle-weight setting, quantum kernel ridge regression using four interpretable inputs (blood C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, bronchoalveolar lavage cellularity, and condition) attains a test root mean squared error of 4.41 mg and coefficient of determination of 0.605, improving over a matched ridge baseline on the same feature set (4.70 mg and 0.553). Geometry-informed Stein-divergence prototype distances yield a smaller but consistent gain in the biomarker-only setting (4.55 mg versus 4.79 mg). Screening-style evaluation, obtained by thresholding the continuous outcome at 0.8 times the training Sham mean, achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of up to 0.90 for detecting low muscle weight.

We propose a two-stage framework for improving behavioral alignment. The first stage, context formation, explicitly specifies the experimental design to establish an accurate representation of the decision task and its context. The second stage, context navigation, guides the reasoning process within that representation to make decisions. We validate this framework through a focal replication of a sequential purchasing game with quality signaling (Kremer and Debo, 2016), extending to a crowdfunding game with costly signaling (Cason et al., 2025) and a demand-estimation task (Gui and Toubia, 2025) to test generalizability across decision environments. Across four state-of-the-art (SOTA) models (GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-4.0-Sonnet-Thinking, DeepSeek-R1), we find that complex decision-making environments require both stages to achieve behavioral alignment with human benchmarks, whereas the simpler demand-estimation task requires only context formation.

Applying rules to such inputs demands both interpretive flexibility and formal guarantees. Large language models (LLMs) provide flexibility but cannot ensure consistent rule application; symbolic systems provide guarantees but require structured input. This paper presents an integration pattern that combines these strengths: LLMs serve as ontology population engines, translating unstructured text into ABox assertions according to expert-authored TBox specifications, while SWRL-based reasoners apply rules with deterministic guarantees. The framework decomposes reasoning into entity identification, assertion extraction, and symbolic verification, with task definitions grounded in OWL 2 ontologies. Experiments across three domains (legal hearsay determination, scientific method-task application, clinical trial eligibility) and eleven language models validate the approach. Structured decomposition achieves statistically significant improvements over few-shot prompting in aggregate, with gains observed across all three domains. An ablation study confirms that symbolic verification provides substantial benefit beyond structured prompting alone. The populated ABox integrates with standard semantic web tooling for inspection and querying, positioning the framework for richer inference patterns that simpler formalisms cannot express.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While conditional computation enables substantial gains in computational efficiency, it remains unclear whether the interaction between sparse routing and temperature-based sampling compromises output stability relative to dense architectures. This work investigates whether conditional computation in MoE models amplifies decoding-induced randomness, leading to reduced reliability as temperature increases. We evaluate three representative models: OLMoE-7B (sparse base), Mixtral-8x7B (sparse instruction-tuned), and Qwen2.5-3B (dense instruction-tuned) on deterministic arithmetic reasoning tasks with objectively verifiable answers. Experiments span four decoding configurations, ranging from greedy decoding to T=1.0. Our evaluation encompasses accuracy, format compliance, output consistency across repeated generations, and confidence metrics, totaling 9,360 model generations. Results demonstrate that the sparse instruction-tuned model exhibits stability comparable to the dense instruction-tuned model across all decoding temperatures, while the sparse base model shows systematic degradation as temperature increases. These findings indicate that instruction tuning, rather than architectural sparsity, is the primary determinant of robustness to decoding randomness on deterministic tasks. We discuss the implications of these results for deploying sparse language models in reliability-critical applications, highlighting scenarios in which sparse architectures can be safely adopted without sacrificing output stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7a00\u758fMoE\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u968f\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff1a\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u800c\u975e\u67b6\u6784\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u662f\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u89e3\u7801\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7a00\u758fMixture-of-Experts\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u968f\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6761\u4ef6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u8def\u7531\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u8f93\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u90e8\u7f72\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u7a00\u758f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578bOLMoe-7B\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578bMixtral-8x7B\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578bQwen2.5-3B\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5ba2\u89c2\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b97\u672f\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4ece\u8d2a\u5a6a\u89e3\u7801\u5230T=1.0\u7684\u56db\u79cd\u89e3\u7801\u914d\u7f6e\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5305\u62ec\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u683c\u5f0f\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3001\u91cd\u590d\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u603b\u8ba19,360\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u89e3\u7801\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u5bc6\u96c6\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u7a00\u758f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u968f\u7740\u6e29\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u51fa\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u67b6\u6784\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u89e3\u7801\u968f\u673a\u6027\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u800c\u975e\u67b6\u6784\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u672c\u8eab\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u67b6\u6784\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u8f93\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

In this paper, we identify a connection between interpretability and robustness that can be directly leveraged during training. Specifically, we observe that spurious, unstable, or semantically irrelevant features identified through Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) contribute disproportionately to adversarial vulnerability. Building on this insight, we introduce an attribution-guided refinement framework that transforms LIME from a passive diagnostic into an active training signal. Our method systematically suppresses spurious features using feature masking, sensitivity-aware regularization, and adversarial augmentation in a closed-loop refinement pipeline.

We systematically evaluate whether Large Language Models can solve these equations through direct numerical prediction or whether a hybrid architecture combining LLM symbolic manipulation with classical iterative solvers proves more effective. Testing six state-of-the-art models (GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Gemini-3-Flash, Gemini-2.5-Lite, Claude-Sonnet-4.5, Claude-Opus-4.5) on 100 problems spanning seven engineering domains, we compare direct prediction against solver-assisted computation where LLMs formulate governing equations and provide initial conditions while Newton-Raphson iteration performs numerical solution. Direct prediction yields mean relative errors of 0.765 to 1.262 across models, while solver-assisted computation achieves 0.225 to 0.301, representing error reductions of 67.9% to 81.8%. Domain-specific analysis reveals dramatic improvements in Electronics (93.1%) due to exponential equation sensitivity, contrasted with modest gains in Fluid Mechanics (7.2%) where LLMs exhibit effective pattern recognition.

However, the same score-based SDE modeling that grants diffusion policies the flexibility to learn diverse behavior also incurs solver and score-matching errors, large data requirements, and inconsistencies in action generation. While less critical in image generation, these inaccuracies compound and lead to failure in continuous control settings. We introduce Contractive Diffusion Policies (CDPs) to induce contractive behavior in the diffusion sampling dynamics. Contraction pulls nearby flows closer to enhance robustness against solver and score-matching errors while reducing unwanted action variance. We develop an in-depth theoretical analysis along with a practical implementation recipe to incorporate CDPs into existing diffusion policy architectures with minimal modification and computational cost. We evaluate CDPs for offline learning by conducting extensive experiments in simulation and real-world settings.

We present MAP-AI (Monte Carlo Alignment for Policy) as a canonical system architecture for operationalizing admissibility alignment, formalizing alignment as a probabilistic, decision-theoretic property rather than a static or binary condition.\n  MAP-AI, a new control-plane system architecture for aligned decision-making under uncertainty, enforces alignment through Monte Carlo estimation of outcome distributions and admissibility-controlled policy selection rather than static model-level constraints. The framework evaluates decision policies across ensembles of plausible futures, explicitly modeling uncertainty, intervention effects, value ambiguity, and governance constraints. Alignment is assessed through distributional properties including expected utility, variance, tail risk, and probability of misalignment rather than accuracy or ranking performance. This approach distinguishes probabilistic prediction from decision reasoning under uncertainty and provides an executable methodology for evaluating trust and alignment in enterprise and institutional AI systems. The result is a practical foundation for governing AI systems whose impact is determined not by individual forecasts, but by policy behavior across distributions and tail events. Finally, we show how distributional alignment evaluation can be integrated into decision-making itself, yielding an admissibility-controlled action selection mechanism that alters policy behavior under uncertainty without retraining or modifying underlying models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u63a5\u7eb3\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06AI\u5bf9\u9f50\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u53ef\u63a5\u7eb3\u884c\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MAP-AI\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u53ef\u63a5\u7eb3\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u65bd\u5bf9\u9f50", "motivation": "\u5c06AI\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u6216\u4e8c\u5143\u6761\u4ef6\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u6027\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u51b3\u7b56\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMAP-AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ed3\u679c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u63a5\u7eb3\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u5b9e\u65bd\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u672a\u6765\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684AI\u6cbb\u7406\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f7f\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u591f\u6574\u5408\u5230\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6539\u53d8\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u63a5\u7eb3\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u548c\u673a\u6784AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u5c3e\u90e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u800c\u975e\u4e2a\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b"}}

Developing deep learning models for approximating their solution operators promises not only fast, practical solvers, but may also inspire models that resolve classical learning tasks from a new perspective. In this work, we build on classical Wiener chaos expansions (WCE) to design neural operator (NO) architectures for SPDEs and SDEs: we project the driving noise paths onto orthonormal Wick Hermite features and parameterize the resulting deterministic chaos coefficients with neural operators, so that full solution trajectories can be reconstructed from noise in a single forward pass. On the theoretical side, we investigate the classical WCE results for the class of multi-dimensional SDEs and semilinear SPDEs considered here by explicitly writing down the associated coupled ODE/PDE systems for their chaos coefficients, which makes the separation between stochastic forcing and deterministic dynamics fully explicit and directly motivates our model designs. On the empirical side, we validate our models on a diverse suite of problems: classical SPDE benchmarks, diffusion one-step sampling on images, topological interpolation on graphs, financial extrapolation, parameter estimation, and manifold SDEs for flood prediction, demonstrating competitive accuracy and broad applicability. Overall, our results indicate that WCE-based neural operators provide a practical and scalable way to learn SDE/SPDE solution operators across diverse domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eWiener\u6df7\u6c8c\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u968f\u673a\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u89e3\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u566a\u58f0\u8def\u5f84\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u6b63\u4ea4\u7684Wick Hermite\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u5230\u5b8c\u6574\u89e3\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "SDEs\u548cSPDEs\u662f\u5efa\u6a21\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5176\u89e3\u7b97\u5b50\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5feb\u901f\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684SDE/SPDE\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u968f\u673a\u5f3a\u8feb\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "1. \u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178Wiener\u6df7\u6c8c\u5c55\u5f00\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u9a71\u52a8\u566a\u58f0\u8def\u5f84\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u6b63\u4ea4\u7684Wick Hermite\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\uff1b2. \u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u6570\uff1b3. \u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u91cd\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u89e3\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b4. \u5bf9\u591a\u7ef4SDE\u548c\u534a\u7ebf\u6027SPDE\u63a8\u5bfc\u5173\u8054\u7684ODE/PDE\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7f\u968f\u673a\u5f3a\u8feb\u4e0e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u5b8c\u5168\u663e\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1a\u7ecf\u5178SPDE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u6269\u6563\u4e00\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u63d2\u503c\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u5916\u63a8\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u4e8e\u6d2a\u6c34\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6d41\u5f62SDE\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eWCE\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60SDE/SPDE\u89e3\u7b97\u5b50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u5230\u89e3\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Although prior studies have advanced the overall design of LLM-based agents, systematic optimization of their internal reasoning and tool-use pipelines remains underexplored. This paper introduces an agent framework grounded in real-world practical experience, with three key innovations: (1) an adaptive prompt generation strategy that aligns with the agent's state and task goals to improve reliability and robustness; (2) a context-aware tool orchestration module that performs tool categorization, semantic retrieval, and adaptive invocation based on user intent and context; and (3) a layered memory mechanism that integrates session memory, task history, and external summaries to improve relevance and efficiency through dynamic summarization and compression. An end-to-end framework named Jenius-Agent has been integrated with three key optimizations, including tools based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), file input/output (I/O), and execution feedback. The experiments show a 20 percent improvement in task accuracy, along with a reduced token cost, response latency, and invocation failures. The framework is already deployed in Jenius (https://www.jenius.cn), providing a lightweight and scalable solution for robust, protocol-compatible autonomous agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faJenius-Agent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5de5\u5177\u7f16\u6392\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u4e09\u5927\u521b\u65b0\u4f18\u5316LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5173\u952e\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u867d\u7136\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u4ecd\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684Jenius-Agent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u5927\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\uff1a(1) \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u8c03\u6574\u63d0\u793a\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b(2) \u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5de5\u5177\u7f16\u6392\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u5de5\u5177\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u7528\uff1b(3) \u5206\u5c42\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4f1a\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6458\u8981\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u9ad8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eMCP\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3001\u6587\u4ef6I/O\u548c\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u4e09\u9879\u5173\u952e\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534720%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86token\u6210\u672c\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8c03\u7528\u5931\u8d25\u7387\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5df2\u90e8\u7f72\u5728Jenius\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4e3a\u5065\u58ee\u3001\u534f\u8bae\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "Jenius-Agent\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6280\u672f\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We evaluate candidate dataset distance metrics by how well they predict cross-dataset transferability: if two datasets have a small distance, a model trained on one should perform well on the other. We apply the framework on an unsupervised task, channel state information (CSI) compression, using autoencoders. Using metrics based on UMAP embeddings, combined with Wasserstein and Euclidean distances, we achieve Pearson correlations exceeding 0.85 between dataset distances and train-on-one/test-on-another task performance. We also apply the framework to a supervised beam prediction in the downlink using convolutional neural networks. For this task, we derive a label-aware distance by integrating supervised UMAP and penalties for dataset imbalance. Across both tasks, the resulting distances outperform traditional baselines and consistently exhibit stronger correlations with model transferability, supporting task-relevant comparisons between wireless datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, there is still no satisfactory theory that describes how coarse-grained quantities, such as blockwise intensity or class proportions after partitioning an image into spatial blocks, are preserved and evolve along the reverse diffusion dynamics. In previous work, the author introduced an information-theoretic Lyapunov function V for non-ergodic Markov processes on a state space partitioned into blocks, defined as the minimal Kullback-Leibler divergence to the set of stationary distributions reachable from a given initial condition, and showed that a leak-tolerant potential V-delta with a prescribed tolerance for block masses admits a closed-form expression as a scaling-and-clipping operation on block masses.\n  In this paper, I transplant this framework to the reverse diffusion process in generative models and propose a reverse diffusion scheme that is projected by the potential V-delta (referred to as the V-delta projected reverse diffusion). I extend the monotonicity of V to time-inhomogeneous block-preserving Markov kernels and show that, under small leakage and the V-delta projection, V-delta acts as an approximate Lyapunov function. Furthermore, using a toy model consisting of block-constant images and a simplified reverse kernel, I numerically demonstrate that the proposed method keeps the block-mass error and the leak-tolerant potential within the prescribed tolerance, while achieving pixel-wise accuracy and visual quality comparable to the non-projected dynamics. This study reinterprets generative sampling as a decrease of an information potential from noise to data, and provides a design principle for reverse diffusion processes with explicit control of coarse-grained quantities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Prior work has attributed this evaluation-deployment gap to problems of measurement and validity. While these critiques are insightful, we argue that they overlook a more fundamental issue: many socio-cognitive evaluations proceed without an explicit theoretical specification of the target capability, leaving the assumptions linking task performance to competence implicit. Without this theoretical grounding, benchmarks that exercise only narrow subsets of a capability are routinely misinterpreted as evidence of broad competence: a gap that creates a systemic validity illusion by masking the failure to evaluate the capability's other essential dimensions. To address this gap, we make two contributions. First, we diagnose and formalize this theory gap as a foundational failure that undermines measurement and enables systematic overgeneralization of benchmark results. Second, we introduce the Theory Trace Card (TTC), a lightweight documentation artifact designed to accompany socio-cognitive evaluations, which explicitly outlines the theoretical basis of an evaluation, the components of the target capability it exercises, its operationalization, and its limitations. We argue that TTCs enhance the interpretability and reuse of socio-cognitive evaluations by making explicit the full validity chain, which links theory, task operationalization, scoring, and limitations, without modifying benchmarks or requiring agreement on a single theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86LLM\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Theory Trace Card(TTC)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u8bb0\u5f55\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u80fd\u529b\u6210\u5206\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u53ca\u5c40\u9650\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u590d\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u8868\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u72ed\u7a84\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u88ab\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u4e3a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u8bca\u65ad\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\u63d0\u51faTheory Trace Card(TTC)\u8fd9\u4e00\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6587\u6863\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u8bb0\u5f55\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u529b\u6784\u6210\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "result": "TTC\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5448\u73b0\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u94fe\u6761\uff08\u7406\u8bba->\u4efb\u52a1\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316->\u8bc4\u5206->\u5c40\u9650\uff09\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6216\u8981\u6c42\u7406\u8bba\u7edf\u4e00\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u662fLLM\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6839\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0cTTC\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u8bb0\u5f55\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

A fundamental challenge in deploying sophisticated ML models for sequential decision-making is the lack of tractable concentration inequalities required for principled exploration. We overcome this limitation by directly modeling the learning curve behavior of the underlying estimator. Specifically, assuming the Mean Squared Error decreases as a power law in the number of training samples, we derive a generalized concentration inequality and prove that ML-UCB achieves sublinear regret. This framework enables the principled integration of any ML model whose learning curve can be empirically characterized, eliminating the need for model-specific theoretical analysis.

While classical A* is valued for its optimality, it incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs in large-scale scenarios. Recent attempts to mitigate these limitations by using Large Language Models for waypoint guidance remain insufficient, as they rely only on text-based reasoning without spatial grounding. As a result, such models often produce incorrect waypoints in topologically complex environments with dead ends, and lack the perceptual capacity to interpret ambiguous physical boundaries. These inconsistencies lead to costly corrective expansions and undermine the intended computational efficiency.\n  We introduce MMP-A*, a multimodal framework that integrates the spatial grounding capabilities of vision-language models with a novel adaptive decay mechanism. By anchoring high-level reasoning in physical geometry, the framework produces coherent waypoint guidance that addresses the limitations of text-only planners. The adaptive decay mechanism dynamically regulates the influence of uncertain waypoints within the heuristic, ensuring geometric validity while substantially reducing memory overhead. To evaluate robustness, we test the framework in challenging environments characterized by severe clutter and topological complexity. Experimental results show that MMP-A* achieves near-optimal trajectories with significantly reduced operational costs, demonstrating its potential as a perception-grounded and computationally efficient paradigm for autonomous navigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "MMP-A* \u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8870\u51cf\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfA*\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u4ee5\u53ca\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfA*\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u65e0\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u70b9\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u7269\u7406\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMPP-A*\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8870\u51cf\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u8def\u5f84\u70b9\u5728\u542f\u53d1\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u51e0\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u4e25\u91cd\u969c\u788d\u7269\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0cMMP-A*\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "MMP-A*\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

However, their ability to generate engaging, long-form narratives -- specifically multi-speaker podcast dialogues -- remains under-explored and difficult to evaluate. Standard metrics like BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture the nuances of conversational naturalness, personality, and narrative flow, often rewarding safe, repetitive outputs over engaging storytelling. In this work, we present a novel pipeline for end-to-end visual podcast generation, and fine-tune a Qwen3-VL-32B model on a curated dataset of 4,000 image-dialogue pairs. Crucially, we use a synthetic-to-real training strategy: we train on high-quality podcast dialogues from the Structured Podcast Research Corpus (SPoRC) paired with synthetically generated imagery, and evaluate on real-world photo sequences from the Visual Storytelling Dataset (VIST). This rigorous setup tests the model's ability to generalize from synthetic training data to real-world visual domains. We propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that moves beyond textual overlap, and use AI-as-a-judge (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Opus 4.5, GPT 5.2) and novel style metrics (average turn length, speaker switch rate) to assess quality. Our experiments demonstrate that our fine-tuned 32B model significantly outperforms a 235B base model in conversational naturalness ($>$80\\% win rate) and narrative depth (+50\\% turn length), while maintaining identical visual grounding capabilities (CLIPScore: 20.39).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u591a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u64ad\u5ba2\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57284000\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf-\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5bf9\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03Qwen3-VL-32B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u672c\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u957f\u7bc7\u5e45\u53d9\u4e8b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u591a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u64ad\u5ba2\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5bf9\u8bdd\u81ea\u7136\u5ea6\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u7b49\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u5956\u52b1\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u800c\u975e\u5438\u5f15\u4eba\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5408\u6210\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5728SPoRC\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u64ad\u5ba2\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728VIST\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7167\u7247\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5305\u542bAI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\uff08Gemini 3 Pro\u3001Claude Opus 4.5\u3001GPT 5.2\uff09\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u98ce\u683c\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u8f6e\u6b21\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5207\u6362\u7387\uff09\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u768432B\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u81ea\u7136\u5ea6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e235B\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u80dc\u7387>80%\uff09\uff0c\u53d9\u4e8b\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e5f\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u8f6e\u6b21\u957f\u5ea6+50%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u80fd\u529b\uff08CLIPScore: 20.39\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8f83\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u53d9\u4e8b\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u957f\u7bc7\u5e45\u89c6\u89c9\u53d9\u4e8b\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u89c6\u89c9\u53d9\u4e8b\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional monitoring methods often rely on manual labor and are time consuming, leading to potential delays in addressing issues. This paper proposes the integration of low-power edge devices using Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) into aquaculture systems to enable real-time automated monitoring and control, such as collecting data and triggering alarms, and reducing labor requirements. The system provides real-time data on the required parameters such as pH levels, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and ammonia levels to control water quality, nutrient levels, and environmental conditions enabling better maintenance, efficient resource utilization, and optimal management of the enclosed aquaculture space. The system enables alerts in case of anomaly detection. The data collected by the sensors over time can serve for important decision-making regarding optimizing water treatment processes, feed distribution, feed pattern analysis and improve feed efficiency, reducing operational costs. This research explores the feasibility of developing TinyML-based solutions for aquaculture monitoring, considering factors such as sensor selection, algorithm design, hardware constraints, and ethical considerations. By demonstrating the potential benefits of TinyML in aquaculture, our aim is to contribute to the development of more sustainable and efficient farming practices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Its objective is to extract hidden and meaningful knowledge from datasets through a structured process comprising several key steps: data selection, preprocessing, transformation, data mining, and visualization. Among the core data mining techniques are classification and clustering. Classification involves predicting the class of new instances using a classifier trained on labeled data. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature, including Decision Tree Induction, Bayesian classifiers, Nearest Neighbor search, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, and Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). The last one is recognized as an effective approach for interpretable and explainable learning. It is grounded in the mathematical structure of the concept lattice, which enables the generation of formal concepts and the discovery of hidden relationships among them. In this paper, we present a state-of-theart review of FCA-based classifiers. We explore various methods for computing closure operators from nominal data and introduce a novel approach for constructing a partial concept lattice that focuses on the most relevant concepts.

There are three principled ways to deal with non-stationarity, including sliding-window, weighted, and restart strategies. As many non-stationary environments exhibit gradual drifting patterns, the weighted strategy is commonly adopted in real-world applications. However, previous theoretical studies show that its analysis is more involved and the algorithms are either computationally less efficient or statistically suboptimal. This paper revisits the weighted strategy for non-stationary parametric bandits. In linear bandits (LB), we discover that this undesirable feature is due to an inadequate regret analysis, which results in an overly complex algorithm design. We propose a \\emph{refined analysis framework}, which simplifies the derivation and, importantly, produces a simpler weight-based algorithm that is as efficient as window/restart-based algorithms while retaining the same regret as previous studies. Furthermore, our new framework can be used to improve regret bounds of other parametric bandits, including Generalized Linear Bandits (GLB) and Self-Concordant Bandits (SCB). For example, we develop a simple weighted GLB algorithm with an $\\tilde{O}(k_\u03bc^{5/4} c_\u03bc^{-3/4} d^{3/4} P_T^{1/4}T^{3/4})$ regret, improving the $\\tilde{O}(k_\u03bc^{2} c_\u03bc^{-1}d^{9/10} P_T^{1/5}T^{4/5})$ bound in prior work, where $k_\u03bc$ and $c_\u03bc$ characterize the reward model's nonlinearity, $P_T$ measures the non-stationarity, $d$ and $T$ denote the dimension and time horizon. Moreover, we extend our framework to non-stationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with function approximation, focusing on Linear Mixture MDP and Multinomial Logit (MNL) Mixture MDP. For both classes, we propose algorithms based on the weighted strategy and establish dynamic regret guarantees using our analysis framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this article, we present MindChat, a privacy-preserving LLM for mental health support, together with MindCorpus, a synthetic multi-turn counseling dataset constructed via a multi-agent role-playing framework. To synthesize high-quality counseling data, the developed dialogue-construction framework employs a dual closed-loop feedback design to integrate psychological expertise and counseling techniques through role-playing: (i) turn-level critique-and-revision to improve coherence and counseling appropriateness within a session, and (ii) session-level strategy refinement to progressively enrich counselor behaviors across sessions. To mitigate privacy risks under decentralized data ownership, we fine-tune the base model using federated learning with parameter-efficient LoRA adapters and incorporate differentially private optimization to reduce membership and memorization risks.

Contemporary QD algorithms focus on low-dimensional measures because high-dimensional measures are prone to distortion, where many solutions found by the QD algorithm map to similar measures. For example, the CMA-MAE algorithm guides measure space exploration with a histogram in measure space that records so-called discount values. However, CMA-MAE stagnates in domains with high-dimensional measure spaces because solutions with similar measures fall into the same histogram cell and thus receive identical discount values. To address these limitations, we propose Discount Model Search (DMS), which guides exploration with a model that provides a smooth, continuous representation of discount values. In high-dimensional measure spaces, this model enables DMS to distinguish between solutions with similar measures and thus continue exploration. We show that DMS facilitates new QD applications by introducing two domains where the measure space is the high-dimensional space of images, which enables users to specify their desired measures by providing a dataset of images rather than hand-designing the measure function. Results in these domains and on high-dimensional benchmarks show that DMS outperforms CMA-MAE and other black-box QD algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While domain-specific foundation models have achieved success for each modality individually, they remain isolated, limiting our ability to model integrated cellular processes. Here we present the Central Dogma Transformer (CDT), an architecture that integrates pre-trained language models for DNA, RNA, and protein following the directional logic of the Central Dogma. CDT employs directional cross-attention mechanisms - DNA-to-RNA attention models transcriptional regulation, while RNA-to-Protein attention models translational relationships - producing a unified Virtual Cell Embedding that integrates all three modalities. We validate CDT v1 - a proof-of-concept implementation using fixed (non-cell-specific) RNA and protein embeddings - on CRISPRi enhancer perturbation data from K562 cells, achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.503, representing 63% of the theoretical ceiling set by cross-experiment variability (r = 0.797). Attention and gradient analyses provide complementary interpretive windows: in detailed case studies, these approaches highlight largely distinct genomic regions, with gradient analysis identifying a CTCF binding site that Hi-C data showed as physically contacting both enhancer and target gene. These results suggest that AI architectures aligned with biological information flow can achieve both predictive accuracy and mechanistic interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Proper reasoning leads to understanding of a given subject. This reasoning was conceptualized as a process of understanding in a particular way, i.e., \"symbolic reasoning\". Foundational Models (FM) demonstrate that this is not a necessary condition for many reasoning tasks: they can \"reason\" by way of imitating the process of \"thinking out loud\", testing the produced pathways, and iterating on these pathways on their own. This leads to some form of reasoning that can solve problems on its own or with few-shot learning, but appears fundamentally different from human reasoning due to its lack of grounding and common sense, leading to brittleness of the reasoning process. These insights promise to substantially alter our assessment of reasoning and its necessary conditions, but also inform the approaches to safety and robust defences against this brittleness of FMs. This paper offers and discusses several philosophical interpretations of this phenomenon, argues that the previously apt metaphor of the \"stochastic parrot\" has lost its relevance and thus should be abandoned, and reflects on different normative elements in the safety- and appropriateness-considerations emerging from these reasoning models and their growing capacity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5730\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u601d\u7ef4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u8fd9\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u54f2\u5b66\u53cd\u601d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u2014\u2014\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u2018\u51fa\u58f0\u601d\u8003\u2019\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u4f7f\u6211\u4eec\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u54f2\u5b66\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5bf9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u51e0\u79cd\u54f2\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e86\u2018\u968f\u673a\u9e66\u9e49\u2019\u8fd9\u4e00\u9690\u55bb\u5df2\u5931\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7531\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u5f3a\u80fd\u529b\u6240\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5f53\u6027\u8003\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u8981\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u601d\u7ef4\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e38\u8bc6\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u4e3a\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5236\u5b9a\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u63aa\u65bd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u975e\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u8981\u6c42\u6211\u4eec\u653e\u5f03\u2018\u968f\u673a\u9e66\u9e49\u2019\u7684\u8fc7\u65f6\u9690\u55bb\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7406\u89e3\u63a8\u7406\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5bf9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u53cd\u601d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u54f2\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, existing screening tools - primarily developed using populations from high-income countries - often underperform in Bangladesh and South Asia, where risk profiles differ. Most of these tools rely on simple additive scoring functions and are based on data from patients with advanced-stage CKD. Consequently, they fail to capture complex interactions among risk factors and are limited in predicting early-stage CKD. Our objective was to develop and evaluate an explainable machine learning (ML) framework for community-based early-stage CKD screening for low-resource settings, tailored to the Bangladeshi and South Asian population context. We used a community-based dataset from Bangladesh, the first such CKD dataset in South and South Asia, and evaluated twelve ML classifiers across multiple feature domains. Ten complementary feature selection techniques were applied to identify robust, generalizable predictors. The final models were assessed using 10-fold cross-validation. External validation was conducted on three independent datasets from India, the UAE, and Bangladesh. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to provide model explainability. An ML model trained on an RFECV-selected feature subset achieved a balanced accuracy of 90.40%, whereas minimal non-pathology-test features demonstrated excellent predictive capability with a balanced accuracy of 89.23%, often outperforming larger or full feature sets. Compared with existing screening tools, the proposed models achieved substantially higher accuracy and sensitivity while requiring fewer and more accessible inputs. External validation confirmed strong generalizability with 78% to 98% sensitivity.

We systematically investigate action smoothness regularization through higher-order derivative penalties, progressing from theoretical understanding in continuous control benchmarks to practical validation in building energy management. Our comprehensive evaluation across four continuous control environments demonstrates that third-order derivative penalties (jerk minimization) consistently achieve superior smoothness while maintaining competitive performance. We extend these findings to HVAC control systems where smooth policies reduce equipment switching by 60%, translating to significant operational benefits.

A crucial component of GNNs is the pooling procedure, in which the node features calculated by the model are combined to form an informative final descriptor to be used for the downstream task. However, previous graph pooling schemes rely on the last GNN layer features as an input to the pooling or classifier layers, potentially under-utilizing important activations of previous layers produced during the forward pass of the model, which we regard as historical graph activations. This gap is particularly pronounced in cases where a node's representation can shift significantly over the course of many graph neural layers, and worsened by graph-specific challenges such as over-smoothing in deep architectures. To bridge this gap, we introduce HISTOGRAPH, a novel two-stage attention-based final aggregation layer that first applies a unified layer-wise attention over intermediate activations, followed by node-wise attention. By modeling the evolution of node representations across layers, our HISTOGRAPH leverages both the activation history of nodes and the graph structure to refine features used for final prediction. Empirical results on multiple graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that HISTOGRAPH offers strong performance that consistently improves traditional techniques, with particularly strong robustness in deep GNNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent studies have integrated artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate formulation and process development, drastically transforming current approaches to pharmaceutical 3D printing. To date, most AI-driven efforts remain narrowly focused, while failing to account for the broader formulation challenges inherent to the technology. Recent advances in AI have introduced artificial general intelligence concepts, wherein systems extend beyond conventional predictive modelling toward more generalised, human-like reasoning. In this work, we investigate the application of large language models (LLMs), fine-tuned on a fused deposition modelling (FDM) dataset comprising over 1400 formulations, to recommend suitable excipients based on active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) dose, and predict filament mechanical properties. Four LLM architectures were fine-tuned, with systematic evaluation of both fine-tuning and generative parameter configurations. Our results demonstrate that Llama2 was best suited for recommending excipients for FDM formulations. Additionally, model selection and parameterisation significantly influence performance, with smaller LLMs exhibiting instances of catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we demonstrate: (i) even with relatively small dataset of over 1400 formulations, it can lead to model catastrophic forgetting; (ii) standard LLM metrics only evaluate linguistic performance but not formulation processability; and (iii) LLMs trained on biomedically-related data do not always produce the best results. Addressing these challenges is essential to advancing LLMs beyond linguistic proficiency and toward reliable systems for pharmaceutical formulation development.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

According to Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations (1953), family resemblance holds that members of a concept or category are connected by overlapping similarities rather than a single defining property. Consequently, a family of entities forms a chain of items sharing overlapping traits. This philosophical idea naturally lends itself to a graph-based approach in machine learning. Accordingly, we propose the Wittgenstein's Family Resemblance (WFR) clustering algorithm and its kernel variant, kernel WFR. This algorithm computes resemblance scores between neighboring data instances, and after thresholding these scores, a resemblance graph is constructed. The connected components of this graph define the resulting clusters. Simulations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WFR is an effective nonlinear clustering algorithm that does not require prior knowledge of the number of clusters or assumptions about their shapes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The NL architecture converts input characteristics into chaos-based ring-rate representations that encapsulate nonlinear relationships within the data, whereas ST progressively enlarges the labelled set utilising high-confidence pseudo-labelled samples. The model's performance is assessed using ten benchmark datasets and five machine learning classifiers, with 85% of the training data considered unlabelled and just 15% utilised as labelled data.

Although many deep learning methods have proven effective in learning time-series data for classification, they were originally developed under the assumption of balanced data distributions. Once data distribution is uneven, these methods tend to ignore the minority class that is typically of higher practical significance. Oversampling methods have been designed to address this by generating minority-class samples, but their reliance on linear interpolation often hampers the preservation of temporal dynamics and the generation of diverse samples. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Evo-TFS, a novel evolutionary oversampling method that integrates both time- and frequency-domain characteristics.

A core challenge in categorical data clustering lies in measuring similarity among attribute values that lack inherent ordering or distance. Without appropriate similarity measures, values are often treated as equidistant, creating a semantic gap that obscures latent structures and degrades clustering quality. Although existing methods infer value relationships from within-dataset co-occurrence patterns, such inference becomes unreliable when samples are limited, leaving the semantic context of the data underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present ARISE (Attention-weighted Representation with Integrated Semantic Embeddings), which draws on external semantic knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct semantic-aware representations that complement the metric space of categorical data for accurate clustering. That is, LLM is adopted to describe attribute values for representation enhancement, and the LLM-enhanced embeddings are combined with the original data to explore semantically prominent clusters.

A significant interaction between educational device time and internet reliability (\\b{eta} = 0.033, p = 0.028) confirmed the Dependency Divide: engagement increased satisfaction only when infrastructure remained reliable. Hyper-Engaged students showed greatest vulnerability despite or because of their sophisticated digital workflows.

The proposed method utilizes a deep neural network with a binarized sensing layer that learns by compressed learning a succinct but consequential seismic acquisition layout from a large corpus of subsurface models. Thus, given a large seismic data set to invert, the trained network selects a smaller subset of the data, then by using representation learning, an autoencoder computes latent representations of the data, followed by K-means clustering of the latent representations to further select the most relevant data for FWI. Effectively, this approach can be seen as a hierarchical selection.

(2) If so, which classifiers are closer, those based on gradient descent (GD) or those based on k-nearest neighbors (kNN)?

On average, ICL is closer to kNN than logistic regression, giving empirical evidence that the attention mechanism behaves more similarly to kNN than GD.

A central requirement of $\u03bc$P is the satisfaction of certain spectral conditions on weight matrices, which ensure consistent feature learning and optimization behavior as model width grows. While these conditions are well understood in theory, guaranteeing their validity in practical training for matrix-based optimizers such as Muon is still under studied. Existing works that study Muon under $\u03bc$P exhibit important limitations: they either do not ensure that the spectral conditions hold throughout the entire training horizon, or require repeated spectral normalization (or Newton-Schulz iterations) applied to both weights and updates, leading to significant computational overhead and reduced practicality. In this work, we show how to reliably guarantee the spectral conditions required by $\u03bc$P for Muon during the entire training process. Our key insight is that for moderately large models, maintaining spectral control at the level of optimizer updates alone is sufficient to preserve $\u03bc$P-compatible scaling, eliminating the need for explicit spectral normalization of the weights. Based on this principle, we develop a variant of Muon, namely Muon++, that satisfies spectral condition throughout the training process. Our results bridge the gap between the theoretical promises of $\u03bc$P and the practical deployment of matrix-based optimizers in long-horizon training.

However, current methods remain impeded by drug data scarcity-induced cold-start challenge, closed label sets, and inadequate modeling of label dependencies. Here we propose an open-ended ADR prediction paradigm based on Graph-Motif feature fusion and Multi-Label Generation (GM-MLG). Leveraging molecular structure as an intrinsic and inherent feature, GM-MLG constructs a dual-graph representation architecture spanning the atomic level, the local molecular level (utilizing fine-grained motifs dynamically extracted via the BRICS algorithm combined with additional fragmentation rules), and the global molecular level. Uniquely, GM-MLG pioneers transforming ADR prediction from multi-label classification into Transformer Decoder-based multi-label generation. By treating ADR labels as discrete token sequences, it employs positional embeddings to explicitly capture dependencies and co-occurrence relationships within large-scale label spaces, generating predictions via autoregressive decoding to dynamically expand the prediction space. Experiments demonstrate GM-MLG achieves up to 38% improvement and an average gain of 20%, expanding the prediction space from 200 to over 10,000 types. Furthermore, it elucidates non-linear structure-activity relationships between ADRs and motifs via retrosynthetic motif analysis, providing interpretable and innovative support for systematic risk reduction in drug safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faGM-MLG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06ADR\u9884\u6d4b\u4ece\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u8f6c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u5b50-\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u4e09\u5c42\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u53d6\u7684BRICS\u57fa\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u9884\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dADR\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u836f\u7269\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u5c01\u95ed\u6807\u7b7e\u96c6\u9650\u5236\u4ee5\u53ca\u6807\u7b7e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u6269\u5c55\u9884\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u3001\u5e76\u80fd\u663e\u5f0f\u6355\u83b7\u6807\u7b7e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efa\u539f\u5b50\u5c42\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u5206\u5b50\u5c42\uff08\u52a8\u6001BRICS\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u57fa\u5e8f\uff09\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u5206\u5b50\u5c42\u7684\u53cc\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u67b6\u6784\uff1b2) \u5c06ADR\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c06\u6807\u7b7e\u89c6\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563token\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u6355\u83b7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u7b7e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u5171\u73b0\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b4) \u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u52a8\u6001\u6269\u5c55\u9884\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "GM-MLG\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe38%\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u589e\u76ca20%\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ece200\u79cd\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8d85\u8fc710,000\u79cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793aADR\u4e0e\u57fa\u5e8f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784-\u6d3b\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u836f\u7269\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u6790\u652f\u6491\u3002", "conclusion": "GM-MLG\u5f00\u521b\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u7aefADR\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u5bf9\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe-\u57fa\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u548c\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5927\u5e45\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7ed3\u6784-\u6d3b\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u964d\u4f4e\u836f\u7269\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u63d0\u4f9b\u521b\u65b0\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose an alternative approach: a lightweight, two-stage framework that can estimate model performance before training given the understanding of the dataset and the focused deep model structures. The first stage predicts a baseline based on the analysis of some measurable properties of the dataset, while the second stage adjusts the estimation with additional information on the model's architectural and hyperparameter details. The setup allows the framework to generalize across datasets and model types. Moreover, we find that some of the underlying features used for prediction - such as dataset variance - can offer practical guidance for model selection, and can serve as early indicators of data quality.

GDME maintains a dynamic model pool that is continuously updated by pruning underperforming models and introducing new ones. It utilizes a dynamic graph structure to represent relationships among models and employs community detection on the graph to select an appropriate subset for ensemble. The graph structure is also used to detect concept drift by monitoring structural changes, allowing the framework to adapt to evolving streaming data. Experiments on seven heterogeneous time series demonstrate that GDME outperforms existing online anomaly detection methods, achieving improvements of up to 24%.

These bounds are intrinsically data- and algorithm-dependent so that one can exploit the properties of data and algorithm to derive tighter bounds. However, we observe that although the flatness bias is crucial for SGD's generalization, these bounds fail to capture the improved generalization under better flatness and are also numerically loose. This is caused by the inadequate leverage of SGD's flatness bias in existing IT bounds. This paper derives a more flatness-leveraging IT bound for the flatness-favoring SGD. The bound indicates the learned models generalize better if the large-variance directions of the final weight covariance have small local curvatures in the loss landscape. Experiments on deep neural networks show our bound not only correctly reflects the better generalization when flatness is improved, but is also numerically much tighter. This is achieved by a flexible technique called \"omniscient trajectory\". When applied to Gradient Descent's minimax excess risk on convex-Lipschitz-Bounded problems, it improves representative IT bounds' $\u03a9(1)$ rates to $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$.

However, the estimation error of diffusion models suffers from the curse of dimensionality $n^{-1/D}$ with the data dimension $D$. Since images are usually a union of low-dimensional manifolds, current works model the data as a union of linear subspaces with Gaussian latent and achieve a $1/\\sqrt{n}$ bound. Though this modeling reflects the multi-manifold property, the Gaussian latent can not capture the multi-modal property of the latent manifold. To bridge this gap, we propose the mixture subspace of low-rank mixture of Gaussian (MoLR-MoG) modeling, which models the target data as a union of $K$ linear subspaces, and each subspace admits a mixture of Gaussian latent ($n_k$ modals with dimension $d_k$). With this modeling, the corresponding score function naturally has a mixture of expert (MoE) structure, captures the multi-modal information, and contains nonlinear property. We first conduct real-world experiments to show that the generation results of MoE-latent MoG NN are much better than MoE-latent Gaussian score. Furthermore, MoE-latent MoG NN achieves a comparable performance with MoE-latent Unet with $10 \\times$ parameters. These results indicate that the MoLR-MoG modeling is reasonable and suitable for real-world data. After that, based on such MoE-latent MoG score, we provide a $R^4\\sqrt{\u03a3_{k=1}^Kn_k}\\sqrt{\u03a3_{k=1}^Kn_kd_k}/\\sqrt{n}$ estimation error, which escapes the curse of dimensionality by using data structure.

While KD has shown strong empirical success in numerous applications, its theoretical underpinnings remain only partially understood. In this work, we adopt a Bayesian perspective on KD to rigorously analyze the convergence behavior of students trained with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We study two regimes: $(i)$ when the teacher provides the exact Bayes Class Probabilities (BCPs); and $(ii)$ supervision with noisy approximations of the BCPs. Our analysis shows that learning from BCPs yields variance reduction and removes neighborhood terms in the convergence bounds compared to one-hot supervision. We further characterize how the level of noise affects generalization and accuracy. Motivated by these insights, we advocate the use of Bayesian deep learning models, which typically provide improved estimates of the BCPs, as teachers in KD. Consistent with our analysis, we experimentally demonstrate that students distilled from Bayesian teachers not only achieve higher accuracies (up to +4.27%), but also exhibit more stable convergence (up to 30% less noise), compared to students distilled from deterministic teachers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we reframe this problem and introduce the Hierarchical Graph ODE (HiGO), a novel framework designed to learn the multi-scale, continuous-time dynamics of wildfires.

These embeddings summarize patterns in vegetation, land surface properties, and long-term environmental dynamics. We find that models using them achieve higher accuracy when predicting flows in basins not used for training, suggesting that they capture key physical differences more effectively than traditional attributes.

Within this framework, we develop a preference-based adversarial attack to generate hard instances that expose solver weaknesses, and quantify the attack impact by the resulting degradation on Pareto-front quality.

To mitigate this, prior work has explored selecting a model from a set of candidates. However, this approach becomes computationally expensive as the number of candidate models increases. Moreover, poorly performing models in the set may also hinder the effectiveness. To tackle this challenge, this work develops a novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that reduces computational complexity and improves prediction efficiency.

Recently, with the advent of digital twins and data-driven decision-making, several statistical and machine-learning methods have been proposed. However, these methods face several challenges, such as dependence on only real sensor datasets, limited labeled data, high false alarm rates, and privacy concerns. To address these problems, we propose a suite of digital twin-integrated federated learning (DTFL) methods that enhance global model performance while preserving data privacy and communication efficiency. Specifically, we present five novel approaches: Digital Twin-Based Meta-Learning (DTML), Federated Parameter Fusion (FPF), Layer-wise Parameter Exchange (LPE), Cyclic Weight Adaptation (CWA), and Digital Twin Knowledge Distillation (DTKD). Each method introduces a unique mechanism to combine synthetic and real-world knowledge, balancing generalization with communication overhead. We conduct an extensive experiment using a publicly available cyber-physical anomaly detection dataset. For a target accuracy of 80%, CWA reaches the target in 33 rounds, FPF in 41 rounds, LPE in 48 rounds, and DTML in 87 rounds, whereas the standard FedAvg baseline and DTKD do not reach the target within 100 rounds. These results highlight substantial communication-efficiency gains (up to 62% fewer rounds than DTML and 31% fewer than LPE) and demonstrate that integrating DT knowledge into FL accelerates convergence to operationally meaningful accuracy thresholds for IIoT anomaly detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we introduce EPIC, a hyperparameter-free decoding approach that incorporates the entropy of future trajectories into LM decoding. EPIC explicitly regulates the amount of uncertainty expressed at every step of generation, aligning the sampling distribution's entropy to the aleatoric (data) uncertainty. Through Entropy-Aware Lazy Gumbel-Max sampling, EPIC manages to be exact, while also being efficient, requiring only a sublinear number of entropy evaluations per step. Unlike current baselines, EPIC yields sampling distributions that are empirically well-aligned with the entropy of the underlying data distribution. Across creative writing and summarization tasks, EPIC consistently improves LM-as-judge preference win-rates over widely used decoding strategies. These preference gains are complemented by automatic metrics, showing that EPIC produces more diverse generations and more faithful summaries.

In fact, under standard complexity conjectures, standard transformers cannot recognize context-free languages (CFLs), a canonical formalism to describe syntax, or even regular languages, a subclass of CFLs (Merrill et al., 2022). Merrill & Sabharwal (2024) show that $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ looping layers (w.r.t. input length $n$) allows transformers to recognize regular languages, but the question of context-free recognition remained open. In this work, we show that looped transformers with $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ looping layers and $\\mathcal{O}(n^6)$ padding tokens can recognize all CFLs. However, training and inference with $\\mathcal{O}(n^6)$ padding tokens is potentially impractical. Fortunately, we show that, for natural subclasses such as unambiguous CFLs, the recognition problem on transformers becomes more tractable, requiring $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ padding. We empirically validate our results and show that looping helps on a language that provably requires logarithmic depth. Overall, our results shed light on the intricacy of CFL recognition by transformers: While general recognition may require an intractable amount of padding, natural constraints such as unambiguity yield efficient recognition algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In response, regulations such as European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandate the deletion of PII upon requests, underscoring the need for reliable and cost-effective data removal solutions. Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising direction for selectively forgetting data points. However, existing unlearning techniques typically apply a uniform forgetting strategy that neither accounts for the varying privacy risks posed by different PII attributes nor reflects associated business risks. In this work, we propose UnPII, the first PII-centric unlearning approach that prioritizes forgetting based on the risk of individual or combined PII attributes. To this end, we introduce the PII risk index (PRI), a composite metric that incorporates multiple dimensions of risk factors: identifiability, sensitivity, usability, linkability, permanency, exposability, and compliancy. The PRI enables a nuanced evaluation of privacy risks associated with PII exposures and can be tailored to align with organizational privacy policies. To support realistic assessment, we systematically construct a synthetic PII dataset (e.g., 1,700 PII instances) that simulates realistic exposure scenarios. UnPII seamlessly integrates with established unlearning algorithms, such as Gradient Ascent, Negative Preference Optimization, and Direct Preference Optimization, without modifying their underlying principles.

To address these critical limitations of scalability and fault-tolerance, we present a distributed approach to federated learning comprising multiple servers with inter-server communication capabilities. While providing a fully decentralized approach, the designed framework retains the core federated learning structure where each server is associated with a disjoint set of clients with server-client communication capabilities. We propose a novel DFL (Distributed Federated Learning) algorithm which uses alternating periods of local training on the client data followed by global training among servers.

In continuous control tasks, even small parameter shifts can produce unstable gaits, complicating both algorithm comparison and real-world transfer. Previous work has shown that such instability arises when policy updates traverse noisy neighborhoods and that the spread of post-update return distribution $R(\u03b8)$, obtained by repeatedly sampling minibatches, updating $\u03b8$, and measuring final returns, is a useful indicator of this noise. Although explicitly constraining the policy to maintain a narrow $R(\u03b8)$ can improve stability, directly estimating $R(\u03b8)$ is computationally expensive in high-dimensional settings. We propose an alternative that takes advantage of environmental stochasticity to mitigate update-induced variability. Specifically, we model state-action return distribution through a distributional critic and then bias the advantage function of PPO using higher-order moments (skewness and kurtosis) of this distribution. By penalizing extreme tail behaviors, our method discourages policies from entering parameter regimes prone to instability. We hypothesize that in environments where post-update critic values align poorly with post-update returns, standard PPO struggles to produce a narrow $R(\u03b8)$.

RealPDEBench consists of five datasets, three tasks, eight metrics, and ten baselines. We first present five real-world measured datasets with paired simulated datasets across different complex physical systems. We further define three tasks, which allow comparisons between real-world and simulated data, and facilitate the development of methods to bridge the two. Moreover, we design eight evaluation metrics, spanning data-oriented and physics-oriented metrics, and finally benchmark ten representative baselines, including state-of-the-art models, pretrained PDE foundation models, and a traditional method. Experiments reveal significant discrepancies between simulated and real-world data, while showing that pretraining with simulated data consistently improves both accuracy and convergence. In this work, we hope to provide insights from real-world data, advancing scientific ML toward bridging the sim-to-real gap and real-world deployment.

However, backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to FL. These attacks aim to implant a stealthy trigger into the global model, causing it to mislead on inputs that possess a specific trigger while functioning normally on benign data. Although pre-aggregation detection is a main defense direction, existing state-of-the-art defenses often rely on fixed defense parameters. This reliance makes them vulnerable to single-point-of-failure risks, rendering them less effective against sophisticated attackers. To address these limitations, we propose FAROS, an enhanced FL framework that incorporates Adaptive Differential Scaling (ADS) and Robust Core-set Computing (RCC). The ADS mechanism adjusts the defense's sensitivity dynamically, based on the dispersion of uploaded gradients by clients in each round. This allows it to counter attackers who strategically shift between stealthiness and effectiveness. Furthermore, the RCC effectively mitigates the risk of single-point failure by computing the centroid of a core set comprising clients with the highest confidence. We conducted extensive experiments across various datasets, models, and attack scenarios. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms current defenses in both attack success rate and main task accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) is a widely used method for evaluating epistasis, exhaustive MDR-based searches become computationally infeasible as the number of loci or the interaction order increases. In this paper, we define the epistasis detection problem as a black-box optimization problem and solve it with a factorization machine with quadratic optimization annealing (FMQA). We propose an efficient epistasis detection method based on FMQA, in which the classification error rate (CER) computed by MDR is used as a black-box objective function. Experimental evaluations were conducted using simulated case-control datasets with predefined high-order epistasis. The results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully identified ground-truth epistasis across various interaction orders and the numbers of genetic loci within a limited number of iterations.

Previous approaches require many safety samples or calibration sets, which not only incur significant computational overhead during realignment but also lead to noticeable degradation in model utility. Contrary to this belief, we show that safety alignment can be fully recovered with only a single safety example, without sacrificing utility and at minimal cost. Remarkably, this recovery is effective regardless of the number of harmful examples used in fine-tuning or the size of the underlying model, and convergence is achieved within just a few epochs. Furthermore, we uncover the low-rank structure of the safety gradient, which explains why such efficient correction is possible. We validate our findings across five safety-aligned LLMs and multiple datasets, demonstrating the generality of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our experiments show that in some feature-dependent noise settings, the state-of-the-art noise-robust PbRL method's learning performance is significantly deteriorated, while PbRL method with no explicit denoising can surprisingly outperform noise-robust PbRL in majority settings.\n  We also find language model's noise exhibits similar characteristics to feature-dependent noise, thereby simulating realistic humans and call for further study in learning with feature-dependent noise robustly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86PbRL\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u590d\u6742\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65e0\u663e\u5f0f\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53cd\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u504f\u597d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u5e38\u542b\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6765\u81ea\u975e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u504f\u597d\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u590d\u6742\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u566a\u58f0\u6982\u5ff5\n2. \u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u53d8\u4f53\uff1a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7279\u5f81\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u8f68\u8ff9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u566a\u58f0\n3. \u5728DMControl\u548cMeta-world\u7684\u590d\u6742\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u566a\u58f0\n4. \u6bd4\u8f83\u72b6\u6001-of-the-art\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2PbRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u65e0\u663e\u5f0f\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd", "result": "1. \u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u566a\u58f0\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2PbRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6076\u5316\n2. \u5728\u591a\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u663e\u5f0f\u53bb\u566a\u7684PbRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u53cd\u800c\u4f18\u4e8e\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u65b9\u6cd5\n3. \u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u566a\u58f0\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u566a\u58f0\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u566a\u58f0", "conclusion": "\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2PbRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u6b64\u7c7b\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

SynRXN decomposes end-to-end synthesis planning into five task families, covering reaction rebalancing, atom-to-atom mapping, reaction classification, reaction property prediction, and synthesis route design. Curated, provenance-tracked reaction corpora are assembled from heterogeneous public sources into a harmonized representation and packaged as versioned datasets for each task family, with explicit source metadata, licence tags, and machine-readable manifests that record checksums, and row counts. For every task, SynRXN provides transparent splitting functions that generate leakage-aware train, validation, and test partitions, together with standardized evaluation workflows and metric suites tailored to classification, regression, and structured prediction settings. For sensitive benchmarking, we combine public training and validation data with held-out gold-standard test sets, and contamination-prone tasks such as reaction rebalancing and atom-to-atom mapping are distributed only as evaluation sets and are explicitly not intended for model training. Scripted build recipes enable bitwise-reproducible regeneration of all corpora across machines and over time, and the entire resource is released under permissive open licences to support reuse and extension. By removing dataset heterogeneity and packaging transparent, reusable evaluation scaffolding, SynRXN enables fair longitudinal comparison of CASP methods, supports rigorous ablations and stress tests along the full reaction-informatics pipeline, and lowers the barrier for practitioners who seek robust and comparable performance estimates for real-world synthesis planning workloads.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This motivates an instance-level audit problem: for a fine-tuned model and a training prompt-response pair, can we infer whether the model was trained on the original prompt or its LLM-refined version within a mixed corpus? This matters for dataset governance and dispute resolution when training data are contested. However, it is non-trivial in practice: refined and raw instances are interleaved in the training corpus with unknown, source-dependent mixture ratios, making it harder to develop provenance methods that generalize across models and training setups. In this paper, we formalize this audit task as Refinement Provenance Inference (RPI) and show that prompt refinement yields stable, detectable shifts in teacher-forced token distributions, even when semantic differences are not obvious. Building on this phenomenon, we propose RePro, a logit-based provenance framework that fuses teacher-forced likelihood features with logit-ranking signals. During training, RePro learns a transferable representation via shadow fine-tuning, and uses a lightweight linear head to infer provenance on unseen victims without training-data access.

In this work, we focus on a setting where domains share underlying structural patterns despite differences in their specific realizations. The task is particularly challenging in the absence of paired observations, which removes direct supervision across domains. We introduce a generative framework, called SerpentFlow (SharEd-structuRe decomPosition for gEnerative domaiN adapTation), for unpaired domain alignment. SerpentFlow decomposes data within a latent space into a shared component common to both domains and a domain-specific one. By isolating the shared structure and replacing the domain-specific component with stochastic noise, we construct synthetic training pairs between shared representations and target-domain samples, thereby enabling the use of conditional generative models that are traditionally restricted to paired settings. We apply this approach to super-resolution tasks, where the shared component naturally corresponds to low-frequency content while high-frequency details capture domain-specific variability. The cutoff frequency separating low- and high-frequency components is determined automatically using a classifier-based criterion, ensuring a data-driven and domain-adaptive decomposition. By generating pseudo-pairs that preserve low-frequency structures while injecting stochastic high-frequency realizations, we learn the conditional distribution of the target domain given the shared representation. We implement SerpentFlow using Flow Matching as the generative pipeline, although the framework is compatible with other conditional generative approaches.

A specific instability that often occurs for large learning rates at the end of training is output logit divergence. The most widely used mitigation strategy, z-loss, merely addresses the symptoms rather than the underlying cause of the problem. In this paper, we analyze the instability from the perspective of the output embeddings' geometry and identify its cause. Based on this, we propose output embedding centering (OEC) as a new mitigation strategy, and prove that it suppresses output logit divergence. OEC can be implemented in two different ways, as a deterministic operation called \u03bc-centering, or a regularization method called \u03bc-loss. Our experiments show that both variants outperform z-loss in terms of training stability and learning rate sensitivity. In particular, they ensure that training converges even for large learning rates when z-loss fails. Furthermore, we find that \u03bc-loss is significantly less sensitive to regularization hyperparameter tuning than z-loss.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The use of group-level rewards successfully aligns the model with the targeted reward. However, it faces challenges including low efficiency, dependency on stochastic samplers, and reward hacking. The problem is that rectified flow models are fundamentally different from LLMs: 1) For efficiency, online image sampling takes much more time and dominates the time of training. 2) For stochasticity, rectified flow is deterministic once the initial noise is fixed. Aiming at these problems and inspired by the effects of group-level rewards from LLMs, we design Group-level Direct Reward Optimization (GDRO). GDRO is a new post-training paradigm for group-level reward alignment that combines the characteristics of rectified flow models. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we point out that GDRO supports full offline training that saves the large time cost for image rollout sampling. Also, it is diffusion-sampler-independent, which eliminates the need for the ODE-to-SDE approximation to obtain stochasticity. We also empirically study the reward hacking trap that may mislead the evaluation, and involve this factor in the evaluation using a corrected score that not only considers the original evaluation reward but also the trend of reward hacking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GDRO effectively and efficiently improves the reward score of the diffusion model through group-wise offline optimization across the OCR and GenEval tasks, while demonstrating strong stability and robustness in mitigating reward hacking.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In sharp contrast, on-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) effectively preserves general capabilities. We investigate this discrepancy and identify a fundamental distributional gap: while RL aligns with the model's internal belief, SFT forces the model to fit external supervision. This mismatch often manifests as \"Confident Conflicts\" tokens characterized by low probability but low entropy. In these instances, the model is highly confident in its own prediction but is forced to learn a divergent ground truth, triggering destructive gradient updates. To address this, we propose Entropy-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (EAFT). Unlike methods relying solely on prediction probability, EAFT utilizes token-level entropy as a gating mechanism to distinguish between epistemic uncertainty and knowledge conflict. This allows the model to learn from uncertain samples while suppressing gradients on conflicting data. Extensive experiments on Qwen and GLM series (ranging from 4B to 32B parameters) across mathematical, medical, and agentic domains confirm our hypothesis. EAFT consistently matches the downstream performance of standard SFT while significantly mitigating the degradation of general capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The traditional data subsampling method works as a static, task independent preprocessing step which usually discards information that is critical to downstream prediction. In this paper, we introduces the antagonistic soft selection subsampling (ASSS) framework as is a novel paradigm that reconstructs data reduction into a differentiable end-to-end learning problem. ASSS uses the adversarial game between selector network and task network, and selector network learning assigns continuous importance weights to samples. This direct optimization implemented by Gumbel-Softmax relaxation allows the selector to identify and retain samples with the maximum amount of information for a specific task target under the guidance of the loss function that balances the fidelity and sparsity of the prediction. Theoretical analysis links this framework with the information bottleneck principle. Comprehensive experiments on four large-scale real world datasets show that ASSS has always been better than heuristic subsampling baselines such as clustering and nearest neighbor thinning in maintaining model performance. It is worth noting that ASSS can not only match, but also sometimes exceed the training performance of the entire dataset, showcasing the effect of intelligent denoising.

Despite a large body of work focused on training frontier vision-language models (VLMs), approaches to their evaluation remain nascent. To guide their maturation, we propose three desiderata that evaluations should satisfy: (1) faithfulness to the modality and application, (2) discriminability between models of varying quality, and (3) efficiency in compute. Through this lens, we identify critical failure modes that violate faithfulness and discriminability, misrepresenting model capabilities: (i) multiple-choice formats reward guessing, poorly reflect downstream use cases, and saturate early as models improve; (ii) blindly solvable questions, which can be answered without images, constitute up to 70% of some evaluations; and (iii) mislabeled or ambiguous samples compromise up to 42% of examples in certain datasets. Regarding efficiency, the computational burden of evaluating frontier models has become prohibitive: by some accounts, nearly 20% of development compute is devoted to evaluation alone. Rather than discarding existing benchmarks, we curate them via transformation and filtering to maximize fidelity and discriminability. We find that converting multiple-choice questions to generative tasks reveals sharp capability drops of up to 35%. In addition, filtering blindly solvable and mislabeled samples improves discriminative power while simultaneously reducing computational cost. We release DatBench-Full, a cleaned evaluation suite of 33 datasets spanning nine VLM capabilities, and DatBench, a discriminative subset that achieves 13x average speedup (up to 50x) while closely matching the discriminative power of the original datasets.

Traditional predictive methods often struggle to balance prediction accuracy with computational efficiency when capturing complex spatial conformations. To address this challenge, we propose an Edge-aware Graph Attention Network (Edge-aware GAT) model for the fine-grained prediction of binding sites across various biomolecules, including proteins, DNA/RNA, ions, ligands, and lipids. Our method constructs atom-level graphs and integrates multidimensional structural features, including geometric descriptors, DSSP-derived secondary structure, and relative solvent accessibility (RSA), to generate spatially aware embedding vectors. By incorporating interatomic distances and directional vectors as edge features within the attention mechanism, the model significantly enhances its representation capacity. On benchmark datasets, our model achieves an ROC-AUC of 0.93 for protein-protein binding site prediction, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods. The use of directional tensor propagation and residue-level attention pooling further improves both binding site localization and the capture of local structural details. Visualizations using PyMOL confirm the model's practical utility and interpretability. To facilitate community access and application, we have deployed a publicly accessible web server at http://119.45.201.89:5000/.

To address the conflict between these two methods, we present CORE, a Code-based Inverse Self-Training Framework with Graph Expansion that bridges imitation and exploration, offering a novel training framework that promotes behavioral diversity while eliminating the reliance on manually reward design.

The inferred reward function, referred to as the Label Function, is executable code that verifies one key step within a task. Building on this, we propose Strategy Graph Expansion to enhance in-domain behavioral diversity, which constructs a multi-path graph called Strategy Graph that captures diverse valid solutions beyond expert demonstrations. Furthermore, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Extrapolation, which enriches out-of-domain behavioral diversity by utilizing both successful and failed trajectories to expand the task space.

Specifically, we introduce three innovations for quantized equivariant transformers: (1) a magnitude-direction decoupled quantization scheme that separately quantizes the norm and orientation of equivariant (vector) features, (2) a branch-separated quantization-aware training strategy that treats invariant and equivariant feature channels differently in an attention-based $SO(3)$-GNN, and (3) a robustness-enhancing attention normalization mechanism that stabilizes low-precision attention computations. Experiments on the QM9 and rMD17 molecular benchmarks demonstrate that our 8-bit models achieve accuracy on energy and force predictions comparable to full-precision baselines with markedly improved efficiency. We also conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component to maintain accuracy and equivariance under quantization, using the Local error of equivariance (LEE) metric.

Existing approaches are fundamentally limited: replay-based methods are impractical and privacy-violating, while strict orthogonality-based methods collapse under scale: each new task is projected onto an orthogonal complement, progressively reducing the residual degrees of freedom and eliminating forward transfer by forbidding overlap in shared representations. In this work, we introduce ELLA, a training framework built on the principle of selective subspace de-correlation. Rather than forbidding all overlap, ELLA explicitly characterizes the structure of past updates and penalizes alignments along their high-energy, task-specific directions, while preserving freedom in the low-energy residual subspaces to enable transfer. Formally, this is realized via a lightweight regularizer on a single aggregated update matrix. We prove this mechanism corresponds to an anisotropic shrinkage operator that bounds interference, yielding a penalty that is both memory- and compute-constant regardless of task sequence length. ELLA requires no data replay, no architectural expansion, and negligible storage. Empirically, it achieves state-of-the-art CL performance on three popular benchmarks, with relative accuracy gains of up to $9.6\\%$ and a $35\\times$ smaller memory footprint. Further, ELLA scales robustly across architectures and actively enhances the model's zero-shot generalization performance on unseen tasks, establishing a principled and scalable solution for constructive lifelong LLM adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These specialized accelerators are not only prohibitively expensive and energy-intensive but also suffer from significant supply scarcity, limiting the ubiquity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) deployment on edge devices. The core of this inefficiency stems from the standard artificial perceptron's dependence on intensive matrix multiplications. However, biological nervous systems achieve unparalleled efficiency without such arithmetic intensity; synaptic signal transmission is regulated by physical ion channel limits and chemical neurotransmitter levels rather than a process that can be analogous to arithmetic multiplication. Inspired by this biological mechanism, we propose Neuro-Channel Networks (NCN), a novel multiplication-free architecture designed to decouple AI from expensive hardware dependencies. In our model, weights are replaced with Channel Widths that physically limit the signal magnitude, while a secondary parameter acts as a Neurotransmitter to regulate Signal Transmission based on sign logic. The forward pass relies exclusively on addition, subtraction, and bitwise operations (minimum, sign), eliminating floating-point multiplication entirely. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate that NCNs can solve non-linearly separable problems like XOR and the Majority function with 100% accuracy using standard backpropagation, proving their capability to form complex decision boundaries without multiplicative weights.

It has been shown that hidden representations learned by deep models can encode sensitive information from the input, making it possible for adversaries to recover the input data with considerable accuracy. This problem is exacerbated in transformer embeddings because they consist of multiple vectors, one per token. To mitigate this risk, we propose Nonparametric Variational Differential Privacy (NVDP), which ensures both useful data sharing and strong privacy protection. We take a differential privacy approach, integrating a Nonparametric Variational Information Bottleneck (NVIB) layer into the transformer architecture to inject noise into its multi-vector embeddings and thereby hide information, and measuring privacy protection with R\u00e9nyi divergence and its corresponding Bayesian Differential Privacy (BDP) guarantee. Training the NVIB layer calibrates the noise level according to utility. We test NVDP on the GLUE benchmark and show that varying the noise level gives us a useful tradeoff between privacy and accuracy.

Alpha decay represents a significant challenge, with traditional models such as DeepLOB losing predictive power as the time horizon (k) increases. In this paper, using data from the FI-2010 dataset, we introduce Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (T-KAN) to replace the fixed, linear weights of standard LSTMs with learnable B-spline activation functions. This allows the model to learn the 'shape' of market signals as opposed to just their magnitude. This resulted in a 19.1% relative improvement in the F1-score at the k = 100 horizon. The efficacy of T-KAN networks cannot be understated, producing a 132.48% return compared to the -82.76% DeepLOB drawdown under 1.0 bps transaction costs. In addition to this, the T-KAN model proves quite interpretable, with the 'dead-zones' being clearly visible in the splines. The T-KAN architecture is also uniquely optimized for low-latency FPGA implementation via High level Synthesis (HLS).

Classical approaches assume a worst-case adversarial model and ensure error correction and data recovery only when the number of honest nodes exceeds the number of adversarial ones by some margin. However, in some emerging decentralized applications, particularly in decentralized machine learning (DeML), participating nodes are rewarded for accepted contributions. This incentive structure naturally gives rise to rational adversaries who act strategically rather than behaving in purely malicious ways.\n  In this paper, we first motivate the need for coding in the presence of rational adversaries, particularly in the context of outsourced computation in decentralized systems. We contrast this need with existing approaches and highlight their limitations. We then introduce the game of coding, a novel game-theoretic framework that extends coding theory to trust-minimized settings where honest nodes are not in the majority. Focusing on repetition coding, we highlight two key features of this framework: (1) the ability to achieve a non-zero probability of data recovery even when adversarial nodes are in the majority, and (2) Sybil resistance, i.e., the equilibrium remains unchanged even as the number of adversarial nodes increases. Finally, we explore scenarios in which the adversary's strategy is unknown and outline several open problems for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We study whether SparseLoCo, a low-communication data parallel method based on infrequent synchronization and sparse pseudo-gradient exchange, can be combined with low-bandwidth pipeline model parallelism via activation and activation-gradient compression. We introduce a heterogeneous distributed training framework where some participants host full replicas on high-bandwidth interconnects, while resource-limited participants are grouped to jointly instantiate a replica using pipeline parallelism with subspace-projected inter-stage communication. To make the recently introduced subspace pipeline compression compatible with SparseLoCo, we study a number of adaptations. Across large-scale language modeling experiments (178M-1B parameters) on standard pretraining corpora, we find that activation compression composes with SparseLoCo at modest cost, while selective (heterogeneous) compression consistently improves the loss-communication tradeoff relative to compressing all replicas-especially at aggressive compression ratios. These results suggest a practical path to incorporating low-bandwidth model parallelism and heterogeneous participants into LLM pre-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
