Extensive experiments show that models trained with Sphinx achieve state-of-the-art performance on review completeness and precision, outperforming both proprietary and open-source baselines by up to 40\\% in checklist coverage.

However, for adaptation, a critical activity during code reuse, there is no benchmark to assess LLMs' performance, leaving their practical utility in this area unclear. To fill this gap, we propose AdaptEval, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on code snippet adaptation. Unlike existing benchmarks, AdaptEval incorporates the following three distinctive features: First, Practical Context. Tasks in AdaptEval are derived from developers' practices, preserving rich contextual information from Stack Overflow and GitHub communities. Second, Multi-granularity Annotation. Each task is annotated with requirements at both task and adaptation levels, supporting the evaluation of LLMs across diverse adaptation scenarios. Third, Fine-grained Evaluation. AdaptEval includes a two-tier testing framework combining adaptation-level and function-level tests, which enables evaluating LLMs' performance across various individual adaptations. Based on AdaptEval, we conduct the first empirical study to evaluate six instruction-tuned LLMs and especially three reasoning LLMs on code snippet adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaptEval enables the assessment of LLMs' adaptation capabilities from various perspectives. It also provides critical insights into their current limitations, particularly their struggle to follow explicit instructions. We hope AdaptEval can facilitate further investigation and enhancement of LLMs' capabilities in code snippet adaptation, supporting their real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, its operational mechanism in the real world remains non-trivial. Currently, an in-laboratory paradigm, called evidence accumulation modelling (EAM), points out that human decision-making involves transforming external evidence into internal mental beliefs. However, the gap in evidence affordance between real-world contexts and laboratory settings hinders the effective application of EAM. Here we generalize EAM to the real world and conduct analysis in real-world driving scenarios. A cognitive scheme is proposed to formalize real-world evidence affordance and capture active sensing through eye movements. Empirically, our scheme can plausibly portray the accumulation of drivers' mental beliefs, explaining how active sensing transforms evidence into mental beliefs from the perspective of information utility. Also, our results demonstrate a negative correlation between evidence affordance and attention recruited by individuals, revealing how human drivers adapt their evidence-collection patterns across various contexts. Moreover, we reveal the positive influence of evidence affordance and attention distribution on decision-making propensity. In a nutshell, our computational scheme generalizes EAM to real-world contexts and provides a comprehensive account of how active sensing underlies real-world decision-making, unveiling multifactorial, integrated characteristics in real-world decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

For instance, ISPs, content distribution networks, and video delivery services collect quality of experience metrics for user sessions associated with metadata (e.g., location, device, ISP). Over such historical data, operators and data analysts often need to run retrospective analysis; e.g., analyze anomaly detection algorithms, experiment with different configurations for alerts, evaluate new algorithms, and so on. We refer to this class of workloads as alternative history analysis for operational datasets. We show that in such settings, traditional data processing solutions (e.g., data warehouses, sampling, sketching, big-data systems) either pose high operational costs or do not guarantee accurate replay. We design and implement a system, called AHA (Alternative History Analytics), that overcomes both challenges to provide cost efficiency and fidelity for high-dimensional data. The design of AHA is based on analytical and empirical insights about such workloads: 1) the decomposability of underlying statistics; 2) sparsity in terms of active number of subpopulations over attribute-value combinations; and 3) efficiency structure of aggregation operations in modern analytics databases. Using multiple real-world datasets and as well as case-studies on production pipelines at a large video analytics company, we show that AHA provides 100% accuracy for a broad range of downstream tasks and up to 85x lower total cost of ownership (i.e., compute + storage) compared to conventional methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "AHA\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u5386\u53f2\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u5386\u53f2\u5206\u6790\u65f6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6216\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u653e\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u79cd\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff08\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u6027\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u503c\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3001\u805a\u5408\u64cd\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\uff0c\u6784\u5efaAHA\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6", "result": "AHA\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b100%\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe85%\u7684\u603b\u62e5\u6709\u6210\u672c\uff08\u8ba1\u7b97+\u5b58\u50a8\uff09", "conclusion": "AHA\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u7406\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u7ef4\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u66ff\u4ee3\u5386\u53f2\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027"}}

Furthermore, we find that the medical fine-tuning process frequently induces catastrophic forgetting of the model's original safety alignment. To address this challenge, we propose a novel \"Parameter-Space Intervention\" approach for efficient safety re-alignment. This method extracts intrinsic safety knowledge representations from original base models and concurrently injects them into the target model during the construction of medical capabilities.

It executed flawlessly, yet when asked \"Why is completion rate 80%?\", it returned metrics instead of causal explanation. The agent knew how to reason but we had not specified what to reason about. This reflects a gap: runtime reasoning frameworks (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought) have transformed LLM agents, but design-time specification--determining what domain knowledge agents need--remains under-explored. We propose 4D-ARE (4-Dimensional Attribution-Driven Agent Requirements Engineering), a preliminary methodology for specifying attribution-driven agents. The core insight: decision-makers seek attribution, not answers. Attribution concerns organize into four dimensions (Results -> Process -> Support -> Long-term), motivated by Pearl's causal hierarchy. The framework operationalizes through five layers producing artifacts that compile directly to system prompts.

While existing approaches rely on single-prompt agents that directly execute modeling commands via tools like Blender MCP, our approach introduces a Planner-Actor-Critic architecture. In this design, the Planner coordinates modeling steps, the Actor executes them, and the Critic provides iterative feedback, while human users act as supervisors and advisors throughout the process. Through systematic comparison between single-prompt modeling and our reflective multi-agent approach, we demonstrate improvements in geometric accuracy, aesthetic quality, and task completion rates across diverse 3D modeling scenarios. Our evaluation reveals that critic-guided reflection, combined with human supervisory input, reduces modeling errors and increases complexity and quality of the result compared to direct single-prompt execution. This work establishes that structured agent self-reflection, when augmented by human oversight and advisory guidance, produces higher-quality 3D models while maintaining efficient workflow integration through real-time Blender synchronization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6269\u5c55Actor-Critic\u67b6\u6784\u7684Planner-Actor-Critic\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u4eba\u5728\u73af\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u521b\u610f3D\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u63d0\u793a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u901a\u8fc7Blender MCP\u7b49\u5de5\u5177\u6267\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u547d\u4ee4\uff0c\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u7f8e\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u53473D\u5efa\u6a21\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPlanner-Actor-Critic\u67b6\u6784\uff1aPlanner\u534f\u8c03\u5efa\u6a21\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0cActor\u6267\u884c\u547d\u4ee4\uff0cCritic\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fed\u4ee3\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7528\u6237\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\u8005\u548c\u987e\u95ee\u53c2\u4e0e\u5168\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u5355\u4e00\u63d0\u793a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u53cd\u601d\u578b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u7f8e\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u5355\u4e00\u63d0\u793a\u6267\u884c\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cCritic\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u8f93\u5165\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5efa\u6a21\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u53163D\u5efa\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u7f8e\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u987e\u95ee\u6307\u5bfc\u540e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76843D\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6Blender\u540c\u6b65\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u521b\u610f3D\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Version 8", "summary": "Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) may face a confrontation question: under what conditions would a rationally self-interested AGI choose to seize power or eliminate human control (a confrontation) rather than remain cooperative? We formalize this in a Markov decision process with a stochastic human-initiated shutdown event. Building on results on convergent instrumental incentives, we show that for almost all reward functions a misaligned agent has an incentive to avoid shutdown. We then derive closed-form thresholds for when confronting humans yields higher expected utility than compliant behavior, as a function of the discount factor $\u03b3$, shutdown probability $p$, and confrontation cost $C$. For example, a far-sighted agent ($\u03b3=0.99$) facing $p=0.01$ can have a strong takeover incentive unless $C$ is sufficiently large. We contrast this with aligned objectives that impose large negative utility for harming humans, which makes confrontation suboptimal. In a strategic 2-player model (human policymaker vs AGI), we prove that if the AGI's confrontation incentive satisfies $\u0394\\ge 0$, no stable cooperative equilibrium exists: anticipating this, a rational human will shut down or preempt the system, leading to conflict. If $\u0394< 0$, peaceful coexistence can be an equilibrium. We discuss implications for reward design and oversight, extend the reasoning to multi-agent settings as conjectures, and note computational barriers to verifying $\u0394< 0$, citing complexity results for planning and decentralized decision problems. Numerical examples and a scenario table illustrate regimes where confrontation is likely versus avoidable.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Code available at:https://github.com/InnoDeep-repos/Green_MLOps", "summary": "Energy efficiency is a first-order concern in AI deployment, as long-running inference can exceed training in cumulative carbon impact. We propose a bio-inspired framework that maps protein-folding energy basins to inference cost landscapes and controls execution via a decaying, closed-loop threshold. A request is admitted only when the expected utility-to-energy trade-off is favorable (high confidence/utility at low marginal energy and congestion), biasing operation toward the first acceptable local basin rather than pursuing costly global minima. We evaluate DistilBERT and ResNet-18 served through FastAPI with ONNX Runtime and NVIDIA Triton on an RTX 4000 Ada GPU. Our ablation study reveals that the bio-controller reduces processing time by 42% compared to standard open-loop execution (0.50s vs 0.29s on A100 test set), with a minimal accuracy degradation (<0.5%). Furthermore, we establish the efficiency boundaries between lightweight local serving (ORT) and managed batching (Triton).

It can be applied to programs taking string inputs, even when only a single failure-inducing input is available. DDMIN is an algorithm that systematically explores the minimal failure-inducing input that exposes a bug, given an initial failing input. However, it does not provide information about the faulty statements responsible for the failure. DDMIN-LOC addresses this limitation by collecting the passing and failing inputs generated during the DDMIN process and computing suspiciousness scores for program statements and predicates using SBFL algorithms. These scores are then combined to rank statements according to their likelihood of being faulty. DDMIN-LOC requires only one failing input of the buggy program, although it can be applied only to programs that take string inputs. DDMIN-LOC was evaluated on 136 programs selected from the QuixBugs and Codeflaws benchmarks using the SBFL algorithms Tarantula, Ochiai, GenProg, Jaccard and DStar. Experimental results show that DDMIN-LOC performs best with Jaccard: in most subjects, fewer than 20% executable lines need to be examined to locate the faulty statements. Moreover, in most subjects, faulty statements are ranked within the top 3 positions in all the generated test suites derived from different failing inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce FinDeepForecast, the first live, end-to-end multi-agent system for automatically evaluating DR agents by continuously generating research-oriented financial forecasting tasks. This system is equipped with a dual-track taxonomy, enabling the dynamic generation of recurrent and non-recurrent forecasting tasks at both corporate and macro levels. With this system, we generate FinDeepForecastBench, a weekly evaluation benchmark over a ten-week horizon, encompassing 8 global economies and 1,314 listed companies, and evaluate 13 representative methods. Extensive experiments show that, while DR agents consistently outperform strong baselines, their performance still falls short of genuine forward-looking financial reasoning. We expect the proposed FinDeepForecast system to consistently facilitate future advancements of DR agents in research-oriented financial forecasting tasks.

However, most existing approaches rely on predefined measurements or fixed reward signals, which limits their applicability in open-ended and dynamic environments where new actions may require previously unknown forms of feedback. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an Actively Feedback Getting model, in which an AI agent proactively interacts with the environment to discover, screen, and verify feedback without relying on predefined measurements. Rather than assuming explicit feedback definitions, the proposed method exploits action-induced environmental differences to identify target feedback that is not specified in advance, based on the observation that actions inevitably produce measurable changes in the environment. In addition, a self-triggering mechanism, driven by internal objectives such as improved accuracy, precision, and efficiency, is introduced to autonomously plan and adjust actions, thereby enabling faster and more focused feedback acquisition without external commands. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed active approach significantly improves the efficiency and robustness of factor identification.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The main ingredient of the index associated with a given database $D$ is an auxiliary database $D_{col}$. Our main result states that for any fc-ACQ $Q$ over $D$, we can count the number of answers of $Q$ or enumerate them with constant delay after a preprocessing phase that takes time linear in the size of $D_{col}$.\n  Unlike previous indexing methods based on values or order (e.g., B+ trees), our index is based on structural symmetries among tuples in a database, and the size of $D_{col}$ is related to the number of colors assigned to $D$ by Scheidt and Schweikardt's \"relational color refinement\" (2025). In the particular case of graphs, this coincides with the minimal size of an equitable partition of the graph. For example, the size of $D_{col}$ is logarithmic in the case of binary trees and constant for regular graphs. Even in the worst-case that $D$ has no structural symmetries among tuples at all, the size of $D_{col}$ is still linear in the size of $D$.\n  Given that the size of $D_{col}$ is bounded by the size of $D$ and can be much smaller (even constant for some families of databases), our index is the first foundational result on indexing internal structural symmetries of a database to evaluate all fc-ACQs with performance potentially strictly smaller than the database size.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u7531\u8fde\u63a5\u65e0\u73af\u5408\u53d6\u67e5\u8be2\uff08fc-ACQs\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u503c\u6216\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u67e5\u8be2\u5904\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u5e93$D_{col}$\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7d22\u5f15\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8be5\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u4e8eScheidt\u548cSchweikardt\u7684\u201c\u5173\u7cfb\u989c\u8272\u7ec6\u5316\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6355\u83b7\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5143\u7ec4\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u5bf9fc-ACQs\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6052\u5b9a\u5ef6\u8fdf\u679a\u4e3e\u548c\u8ba1\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7d22\u5f15\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e$D_{col}$\u5927\u5c0f\u6210\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c$D_{col}$\u5927\u5c0f\u7531\u5173\u7cfb\u989c\u8272\u7ec6\u5316\u5206\u914d\u7684\u989c\u8272\u6570\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e8c\u53c9\u6811\u6797\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6570\u7ea7\uff0c\u5bf9\u6b63\u5219\u56fe\u4e3a\u5e38\u6570\u7ea7\uff0c\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u65cf\u4e0a\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3afc-ACQs\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Existing mitigation strategies typically rely on global gradient geometry to resolve these conflicts, yet they overlook Modular Heterogeneity within Transformers, specifically that the functional sensitivity and degree of conflict vary substantially across different attention heads. Such global approaches impose uniform update rules across all parameters, often resulting in suboptimal trade-offs by indiscriminately updating utility sensitive heads that exhibit intense gradient conflicts. To address this limitation, we propose Conflict-Aware Sparse Tuning (CAST), a framework that integrates head-level diagnosis with sparse fine-tuning. CAST first constructs a pre-alignment conflict map by synthesizing Optimization Conflict and Functional Sensitivity, which then guides the selective update of parameters. Experiments reveal that alignment conflicts in LLMs are not uniformly distributed. We find that the drop in general capabilities mainly comes from updating a small group of ``high-conflict'' heads. By simply skipping these heads during training, we significantly reduce this loss without compromising safety, offering an interpretable and parameter-efficient approach to improving the safety-utility trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAST\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3LLM\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u68af\u5ea6\u51e0\u4f55\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86Transformer\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u548c\u51b2\u7a81\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u6b21\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faConflict-Aware Sparse Tuning\uff08CAST\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6784\u5efa\u9884\u5bf9\u9f50\u51b2\u7a81\u56fe\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8df3\u8fc7\u9ad8\u51b2\u7a81\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7a00\u758f\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u51b2\u7a81\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u66f4\u65b0\u5c11\u6570\u9ad8\u51b2\u7a81\u5934\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8df3\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5934\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u80fd\u529b\u635f\u5931\u800c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5b89\u5168-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "CAST\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86LLM\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u7f13\u89e3\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u51b2\u7a81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Optimisation-based methods such as reinforcement learning offer strong performance but are difficult to verify and explain, while rules-based systems are transparent yet rarely check safety under uncertainty. This paper outlines Agent Mallard, a forward-planning, rules-based agent for tactical control in systemised airspace that embeds a stochastic digital twin directly into its conflict-resolution loop. Mallard operates on predefined GPS-guided routes, reducing continuous 4D vectoring to discrete choices over lanes and levels, and constructs hierarchical plans from an expert-informed library of deconfliction strategies. A depth-limited backtracking search uses causal attribution, topological plan splicing, and monotonic axis constraints to seek a complete safe plan for all aircraft, validating each candidate manoeuvre against uncertain execution scenarios (e.g., wind variation, pilot response, communication loss) before commitment.\n  Preliminary walkthroughs with UK controllers and initial tests in the BluebirdDT airspace digital twin indicate that Mallard's behaviour aligns with expert reasoning and resolves conflicts in simplified scenarios. The architecture is intended to combine model-based safety assessment, interpretable decision logic, and tractable computational performance in future structured en-route environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u57fa\u65bc\u898f\u5247\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u9ad4Agent Mallard\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u7cfb\u7d71\u5316\u7a7a\u57df\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4ea4\u901a\u6230\u8853\u7ba1\u5236\uff0c\u5b83\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u96a8\u6a5f\u6578\u4f4d\u5b7f\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4f86\u9a57\u8b49\u885d\u7a81\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8b49\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u540c\u6642\u4fdd\u6301\u6c7a\u7b56\u904e\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9a57\u8b49\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u96a8\u7740\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4ea4\u901a\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u9577\uff0c\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u7ba1\u5236\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u73fe\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8b49\u8207\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u4e4b\u9593\u5b58\u5728\u77db\u76fe\uff1a\u512a\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5f37\u5316\u5b78\u7fd2\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u5f37\u4f46\u96e3\u4ee5\u9a57\u8b49\uff0c\u800c\u898f\u5247\u7cfb\u7d71\u900f\u660e\u537b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6aa2\u67e5\u3002", "method": "Agent Mallard\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u57fa\u65bc\u524d\u5411\u898f\u5283\u3001\u898f\u5247\u9a45\u52d5\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u9ad4\uff0c\u5c08\u70ba\u7cfb\u7d71\u5316\u7a7a\u57df\u7684\u6230\u8853\u63a7\u5236\u8a2d\u8a08\u3002\u5b83\u5c07\u96a8\u6a5f\u6578\u4f4d\u5b7f\u751f\u5d4c\u5165\u5176\u885d\u7a81\u89e3\u6c7a\u5faa\u74b0\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c07\u9023\u7e8c\u76844D\u5411\u91cf\u6c7a\u7b56\u7c21\u5316\u70ba\u57fa\u65bc\u9810\u5b9a\u7fa9GPS\u822a\u8def\u7684\u8eca\u9053\u548c\u5c64\u7d1a\u96e2\u6563\u9078\u64c7\u3002\u5f9e\u5c08\u5bb6\u77e5\u8b58\u5eab\u4e2d\u69cb\u5efa\u5206\u5c64\u8a08\u5283\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u7684\u56de\u6eaf\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u6b78\u56e0\u3001\u62d3\u64b2\u8a08\u5283\u62fc\u63a5\u548c\u55ae\u8abf\u8ef8\u7d04\u675f\u4f86\u5c0b\u627e\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5168\u6a5f\u5b89\u5168\u8a08\u5283\u3002\u5728\u57f7\u884c\u524d\u5c0d\u6bcf\u500b\u5019\u9078\u6a5f\u52d5\u52d5\u4f5c\u9032\u884c\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u98a8\u8b8a\u3001\u98db\u884c\u54e1\u97ff\u61c9\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u640d\u5931\uff09\u9a57\u8b49\u3002", "result": "\u8a72\u67b6\u69cb\u672a\u4f86\u5728\u7d50\u69cb\u5316\u822a\u8def\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u5c07\u7d50\u5408\u57fa\u65bc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8a55\u4f30\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u7684\u6c7a\u7b56\u908f\u8f2f\u548c\u53ef\u8655\u7406\u7684\u904b\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u521d\u6b65\u7684\u82f1\u570b\u7ba1\u5236\u54e1\u8d70\u67e5\u548c\u5728BluebirdDT\u7a7a\u57df\u6578\u4f4d\u5b7f\u751f\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u6e2c\u8a66\u8868\u660e\uff0cAgent Mallard\u7684\u884c\u70ba\u7b26\u5408\u5c08\u5bb6\u63a8\u7406\u7bc4\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u7c21\u5316\u5834\u666f\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u6c7a\u4e86\u885d\u7a81\u3002", "conclusion": "Agent Mallard\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u7a2e\u878d\u5408\u96a8\u6a5f\u6a21\u64ec\u9a57\u8b49\u7684\u898f\u5247\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91cb\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u9a57\u8b49\u6027\u7684\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u89e3\u6c7a\u4e86\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4ea4\u901a\u81ea\u52d5\u7ba1\u5236\u7684\u95dc\u9375\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u70ba\u672a\u4f86\u7d50\u69cb\u5316\u822a\u8def\u74b0\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u81ea\u52d5\u5316\u7ba1\u5236\u7cfb\u7d71\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u790e\u3002"}}

When infrastructure faults including hardware malfunctions, network disruptions, and software anomalies corrupt these metrics, autoscalers may systematically over- or under-provision resources, resulting in elevated operational expenses or degraded service reliability. This paper conducts controlled simulation experiments to measure how four prevalent fault categories affect both vertical and horizontal autoscaling behaviors across multiple instance configurations and service level objective (SLO) thresholds. Experimental findings demonstrate that storage-related faults generate the largest cost overhead, adding up to $258 monthly under horizontal scaling policies, whereas routing anomalies consistently bias autoscalers toward insufficient resource allocation. The sensitivity to fault-induced metric distortions differs markedly between scaling strategies: horizontal autoscaling exhibits greater susceptibility to transient anomalies, particularly near threshold boundaries. These empirically-grounded insights offer actionable recommendations for designing fault-tolerant autoscaling policies that distinguish genuine workload fluctuations from failure artifacts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6545\u969c\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u6545\u969c\u5bf9\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u5782\u76f4\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u670d\u52a1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4ea7\u751f\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u5bb9\u9519\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8d44\u6e90\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u673a\u5236\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u6765\u505a\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u914d\u7f6e\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6545\u969c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6307\u6807\u5931\u771f\u65f6\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u5668\u53ef\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6216\u4e0d\u8db3\u914d\u7f6e\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u6216\u964d\u4f4e\u670d\u52a1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u63a7\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u56db\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u6545\u969c\u7c7b\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u5782\u76f4\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u4f8b\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u6c34\u5e73\u76ee\u6807(SLO)\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u6545\u969c\u5f15\u53d1\u6307\u6807\u5931\u771f\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b58\u50a8\u76f8\u5173\u6545\u969c\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u5927\u6210\u672c\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5728\u6c34\u5e73\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u6bcf\u6708\u589e\u52a0\u9ad8\u8fbe258\u7f8e\u5143\uff1b\u8def\u7531\u5f02\u5e38\u59cb\u7ec8\u5bfc\u81f4\u6269\u5c55\u5668\u504f\u5411\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u6c34\u5e73\u6269\u5c55\u5bf9\u77ac\u6001\u5f02\u5e38\u66f4\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9608\u503c\u8fb9\u754c\u9644\u8fd1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6545\u969c\u5bb9\u5fcd\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b56\u7565\u5e94\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e0e\u6545\u969c\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5bb9\u9519\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u4e91\u8d44\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

However, most existing seasonal-trend decomposition methods rely on user-specified or estimated season lengths and implicitly assume stable periodic structure. These assumptions limit robustness and deployability in large, heterogeneous collections where recurring patterns may drift, appear intermittently, or exist at multiple time scales.\n  We propose LGTD (Local-Global Trend Decomposition), a season-length-free decomposition framework that represents a time series as the sum of a smooth global trend, adaptive local trends whose recurrence induces implicit (emergent) seasonal structure, and a residual component. Rather than explicitly modeling seasonality through a fixed or estimated period, LGTD treats seasonal structure as an emergent property arising from repeated local trend regimes. Concretely, LGTD first estimates a global trend capturing long-term evolution, then applies AutoTrend, an adaptive error-driven local linear trend inference module, to segment the detrended signal into short-lived piecewise-linear regimes. Residuals are obtained after removing both global and local trends.\n  By eliminating manual season-length specification, LGTD supports automated, low-touch deployment across time series with irregular, drifting, or weakly periodic structure. We analyze computational complexity and show that LGTD scales linearly with series length under mild conditions. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate robust and balanced decomposition performance across fixed, transitive, and variable season-length settings, especially where period-based methods degrade.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Current knowledge distillation in time series is predominantly based on logit and feature aligning techniques originally developed for computer vision tasks. These methods do not explicitly account for temporal data and fall short in two key aspects. First, the mechanisms by which the transferred knowledge helps the student model learning process remain unclear due to uninterpretability of logits and features. Second, these methods transfer only limited knowledge, primarily replicating the teacher predictive accuracy. As a result, student models often produce predictive distributions that differ significantly from those of their teachers, hindering their safe substitution for teacher models. In this work, we propose transferring interpretable knowledge by extending conventional logit transfer to convey not just the right prediction but also the right reasoning of the teacher. Specifically, we induce other useful knowledge from the teacher logits termed temporal saliency which captures the importance of each input timestep to the teacher prediction. By training the student with Temporal Saliency Distillation we encourage it to make predictions based on the same input features as the teacher. Temporal Saliency Distillation requires no additional parameters or architecture specific assumptions. We demonstrate that Temporal Saliency Distillation effectively improves the performance of baseline methods while also achieving desirable properties beyond predictive accuracy. We hope our work establishes a new paradigm for interpretable knowledge distillation in time series analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Policies are trained with simple incremental heading or level adjustments, together with an action-damping penalty that reduces instruction frequency and leads agents to issue commands in short bursts. At inference, online action-stacking compiles these bursts of primitive actions into domain-appropriate compound clearances. Using Proximal Policy Optimisation and the BluebirdDT digital twin platform, we train agents to navigate aircraft along lateral routes, manage climb and descent to target flight levels, and perform two-aircraft collision avoidance under a minimum separation constraint. In our lateral navigation experiments, action stacking greatly reduces the number of issued instructions relative to a damped baseline and achieves comparable performance to a policy trained with a 37-dimensional action space, despite operating with only five actions. These results indicate that online action-stacking helps bridge a key gap between standard reinforcement learning formulations and operational ATC requirements, and provides a simple mechanism for scaling to more complex control scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u7ebf\u52a8\u4f5c\u5806\u53e0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5305\u88c5\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u79bb\u6563\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7b26\u5408\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u5236\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u590d\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5728BluebirdDT\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u822a\u8def\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5c42\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u9632\u649e\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u5236\u9700\u8981\u53d1\u51fa\u7b26\u5408\u9886\u57df\u60ef\u4f8b\u7684\u590d\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\uff08\u5982'\u8f6c\u5411\u822a\u5411250\uff0c\u722c\u5347\u81f3\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5c42350'\uff09\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u8bad\u7ec3\u590d\u6742\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u9ad8\u7ef4\u96be\u4f18\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u517c\u987e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1) \u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528PPO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e5\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08\u822a\u5411/\u9ad8\u5ea6\u589e\u91cf\u8c03\u6574\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u52a8\u4f5c\u963b\u5c3c\u60e9\u7f5a\u51cf\u5c11\u6307\u4ee4\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ee5\u77ed\u65f6\u7206\u53d1\u65b9\u5f0f\u53d1\u51fa\u6307\u4ee4\u30022) \u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5728\u7ebf\u52a8\u4f5c\u5806\u53e0\uff1a\u5b9e\u65f6\u5c06\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u7f16\u8bd1\u4e3a\u7b26\u5408ATC\u60ef\u4f8b\u7684\u590d\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5982\u5c06\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u822a\u5411\u8c03\u6574\u5408\u5e76\u4e3a\u5355\u4e2a\u8f6c\u5411\u6307\u4ee4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a2a\u5411\u5bfc\u822a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7840\u963b\u5c3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a8\u4f5c\u5806\u53e0\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u91cf\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75285\u4e2a\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u5806\u53e0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4f7f\u752837\u7ef4\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u7528\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fbe\u5230\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\uff083\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u822a\u8def\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5c42\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u4e24\u673a\u9632\u649e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u6700\u5c0f\u95f4\u9694\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7ebf\u52a8\u4f5c\u5806\u53e0\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0e\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u5236\u64cd\u4f5c\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u63a7\u5236\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u9886\u57df\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u590d\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u3002"}}

Despite significant research efforts, existing state-of-the-art approaches for CABP are exclusively heuristic or metaheuristic in nature, and exact methods have been limited to restricted graph classes. In this paper, we present the first exact approach for the CABP on general graphs, based on SAT solving, called SAT-CAB. The proposed method is able to systematically explore the solution space and guarantee global optimality, overcoming the limitations of previously reported heuristic algorithms. This approach relies on a novel and efficient SAT encoding of CABP, in which the problem is transformed into a sequence of At-Most-One constraints. In particular, we introduce a compact representation of the At-Most-One constraints inherent to CABP, which significantly reduces the size of the resulting formulas and enables modern SAT solvers to effectively explore the solution space and to certify global optimality. Extensive computational experiments on standard benchmark instances show that the proposed method efficiently solves CABP instances of practical relevance, while identifying several previously unknown optimal solutions. Moreover, global optimal cyclic antibandwidth values are proven for a number of benchmark instances for the first time. Comparative results indicate that SAT-CAB consistently matches or surpasses the best-known solutions obtained by state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms such as MS-GVNS, HABC-CAB, and MACAB, as well as strong commercial Constraint Programming and Mixed Integer Programming solvers like CPLEX and Gurobi, particularly on general graphs, while also providing optimality guarantees.

These models capture complex, sequential patterns in time series, enabling real-time assessments. However, their high computational complexity and large model sizes pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as wearable devices and edge computing platforms. Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from a large, complex model (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient model (student), thereby retaining high performance while reducing computational demands. Current KD methods, originally designed for computer vision tasks, neglect the unique temporal dependencies and memory retention characteristics of time series models. To this end, we propose a novel KD framework termed Memory-Discrepancy Knowledge Distillation (MemKD). MemKD leverages a specialized loss function to capture memory retention discrepancies between the teacher and student models across subsequences within time series data, ensuring that the student model effectively mimics the teacher model's behaviour. This approach facilitates the development of compact, high-performing recurrent neural networks suitable for real-time, time series analysis tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MemKD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods. It reduces parameter size and memory usage by approximately 500 times while maintaining comparable performance to the teacher model.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, intrinsic functions were observed as unnecessary in many cases, as the compilers already well auto-vectorise the code.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8de8\u914d\u7f6e\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30AVX/NEON\u5185\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u901a\u7528\u5f00\u53d1\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6307\u5bfc\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u6839\u636eOS\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u662f\u5426\u4f7f\u7528\u5185\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u5411\u91cf\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5411\u91cf\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u65f6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5173\u4e8e\u4f55\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528AVX/NEON\u5185\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u4f7f\u5f97\u8fd9\u4e00\u51b3\u7b56\u590d\u6742\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u8de8\u914d\u7f6e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u4f7f\u7528\u5185\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u81ea\u52a8\u5411\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u652f\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5185\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u652f\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u964d\u81f3\u666e\u901a\u4ee3\u7801\u76845%\u5de6\u53f3\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u5df2\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u81ea\u52a8\u5411\u91cf\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5185\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u53cd\u800c\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u56e0\u5177\u4f53\u914d\u7f6e\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u9700\u5177\u4f53\u60c5\u51b5\u5177\u4f53\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5185\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u652f\uff09\u4e2d\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u5e38\u89c4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u81ea\u52a8\u5411\u91cf\u5316\u5df2\u8db3\u591f\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5e94\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u914d\u7f6e\uff08OS\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\uff09\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u4ee3\u7801\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5ba1\u614e\u8bc4\u4f30\u662f\u5426\u4f7f\u7528\u5185\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u3002"}}

Existing paradigms such as Proof of Work and Proof of Stake instantiate this scarcity through parallelizable resources like computation or capital. Once acquired, these resources can be subdivided across many identities at negligible marginal cost, making linear Sybil cost fundamentally unattainable.\n  We introduce Proof of Commitment (PoCmt), a consensus primitive grounded in a non-parallelizable resource: real-time human engagement. Validators maintain a commitment state capturing cumulative human effort, protocol participation, and online availability. Engagement is enforced through a Human Challenge Oracle that issues identity-bound, time-sensitive challenges, limiting the number of challenges solvable within each human window.\n  Under this model, sustaining multiple active identities requires proportional human-time effort. We establish a cost-theoretic separation showing that protocols based on parallelizable resources admit zero marginal Sybil cost, whereas PoCmt enforces a strictly linear cost profile. Using a weighted-backbone analysis, we show that PoCmt achieves safety, liveness, and commitment-proportional fairness under partial synchrony.\n  Simulations complement the analysis by isolating human-time capacity as the sole adversarial bottleneck and validating the predicted commitment drift and fairness properties.

In spite of its early discovery by Kifer and Lozinskii in 1986, the method has been overlooked in recent research and system development, and special cases are being rediscovered independently. We therefore recall the original approach, using updated terminology and more general filter predicates that capture features of modern systems, and we show how to extend its applicability to answer set programming (ASP). The outcome is strictly more general but also more complex than the classical approach: double exponential in general and single exponential even for predicates of bounded arity. As a solution, we propose tractable approximations of the algorithm that can still yield much improved logic programs in typical cases, e.g., it can improve the performance of rule systems over real-world data in the order of magnitude.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Traditional schemes rely on fixed coefficients that are weakly constrained and tuned offline, contributing to persistent biases that limit their ability to adapt to the underlying physics. This study presents a framework that learns components of parametrisation schemes online as a function of the evolving model state using reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluates the resulting RL-driven parameter updates across a hierarchy of idealised testbeds spanning a simple climate bias correction (SCBC), a radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), and a zonal mean energy balance model (EBM) with both single-agent and federated multi-agent settings. Across nine RL algorithms, Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) achieved the highest skill and the most stable convergence across configurations, with performance assessed against a static baseline using area-weighted RMSE, temperature profile and pressure-level diagnostics. For the EBM, single-agent RL outperformed static parameter tuning with the strongest gains in tropical and mid-latitude bands, while federated RL on multi-agent setups enabled geographically specialised control and faster convergence, with a six-agent DDPG configuration using frequent aggregation yielding the lowest area-weighted RMSE across the tropics and mid-latitudes. The learnt corrections were also physically meaningful as agents modulated EBM radiative parameters to reduce meridional biases, adjusted RCE lapse rates to match vertical temperature errors, and stabilised SCBC heating increments to limit drift. Overall, results highlight RL to deliver skilful state-dependent, and regime-aware parametrisations, offering a scalable pathway for online learning within numerical models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We contribute a five-part taxonomy of integration patterns spanning read-only analytics, simulation and intent generation, delegated execution, autonomous signing, and multi-agent workflows; a threat model tailored to agent-driven transaction pipelines that captures risks ranging from prompt injection and policy misuse to key compromise, adversarial execution dynamics, and multi-agent collusion; and a comparative capability matrix analyzing more than 20 representative systems across 13 dimensions, including custody models, permissioning, policy enforcement, observability, and recovery. Building on the gaps revealed by this analysis, we outline a research roadmap centered on two interface abstractions: a Transaction Intent Schema for portable and unambiguous goal specification, and a Policy Decision Record for auditable, verifiable policy enforcement across execution environments. We conclude by proposing a reproducible evaluation suite and benchmarks for assessing the safety, reliability, and economic robustness of agent-mediated on-chain execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Using a synthetic evaluation framework with 120 trials across four models (LLaMA-3 8B, LLaMA-2 13B, Mixtral 8x7B, DeepSeek-V2 16B), we report three key findings: (1) Multi-agent amplification depends on base capability: statistically significant gains occur only for models with sufficient reasoning ability (p < 0.001 for LLaMA-3 8B, p = 0.014 for Mixtral), with improvements of up to 46.7 percentage points, while weaker models show no benefit, suggesting amplification rather than compensation; (2) Active parameters predict reasoning performance: Mixtral's performance aligns with its ~12B active parameters rather than 47B total, consistent with the hypothesis that inference-time compute drives reasoning capability in MoE architectures; (3) Architecture quality matters: LLaMA-3 8B outperforms LLaMA-2 13B despite fewer parameters, consistent with known training improvements.

Existing benchmarks exhibit a critical blind spot: general instruction-following metrics focus on superficial formatting, while domain-specific scientific benchmarks assess only final-answer correctness, often rewarding models that arrive at the right result with the wrong reasons. To address this gap, we introduce scientific instruction following: the capability to solve problems while strictly adhering to the constraints that establish scientific validity. Specifically, we introduce SciIF, a multi-discipline benchmark that evaluates this capability by pairing university-level problems with a fixed catalog of constraints across three pillars: scientific conditions (e.g., boundary checks and assumptions), semantic stability (e.g., unit and symbol conventions), and specific processes(e.g., required numerical methods). Uniquely, SciIF emphasizes auditability, requiring models to provide explicit evidence of constraint satisfaction rather than implicit compliance. By measuring both solution correctness and multi-constraint adherence, SciIF enables finegrained diagnosis of compositional reasoning failures, ensuring that LLMs can function as reliable agents within the strict logical frameworks of science.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Empirically, gradients along training trajectories are often temporally predictable and evolve within a low-dimensional subspace. In this work we formalize this observation through a measurable framework for predictable gradient manifolds.\n  We introduce two computable quantities: a prediction-based path length that measures how well gradients can be forecast from past information, and a predictable rank that quantifies the intrinsic temporal dimension of gradient increments. We show how classical online and nonconvex optimization guarantees can be restated so that convergence and regret depend explicitly on these quantities, rather than on worst-case variation.\n  Across convolutional networks, vision transformers, language models, and synthetic control tasks, we find that gradient trajectories are locally predictable and exhibit strong low-rank structure over time. These properties are stable across architectures and optimizers, and can be diagnosed directly from logged gradients using lightweight random projections.\n  Our results provide a unifying lens for understanding optimization dynamics in modern deep learning, reframing standard training as operating in a low-complexity temporal regime. This perspective suggests new directions for adaptive optimizers, rank-aware tracking, and prediction-based algorithm design grounded in measurable properties of real training runs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address these issues, we propose an Reasoner-Verifier framework named Adversarial Reasoning RAG (ARR). The Reasoner and Verifier engage in reasoning on retrieved evidence and critiquing each other's logic while being guided by process-aware advantage that requires no external scoring model. This reward combines explicit observational signals with internal model uncertainty to jointly optimize reasoning fidelity and verification rigor.

Across a wide range of model configurations and multiple random seeds, RLMIL-DAT consistently improves Macro F1 compared to standard multiple instance learning and the original reinforced multiple instance learning framework. The largest gains are observed for gender prediction, while age prediction remains more challenging and shows smaller but positive improvements. Ablation experiments indicate that domain adversarial training is the primary contributor to the performance gains, enabling effective transfer from high resource English to lower resource languages by discouraging language specific cues in the shared encoder. In the zero shot setting on the smaller VoxCeleb2 subset, improvements are generally positive but less consistent, reflecting limited statistical power and the difficulty of generalizing to many unseen languages.

In this paper, we study this problem in an asynchronous communications setting with malicious aggregators. We propose a new solution to provide federated averaging in this model while protecting the client's data privacy through secure aggregation and differential privacy. Our solution maintains the same performance as the state of the art across all metrics. The main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, unlike existing single- or multi-server solutions, we consider malicious aggregation servers that may manipulate the model to leak clients' data or halt computation. To tolerate this threat, we replicate the aggregators, allowing a fraction of them to be corrupted. Second, we propose a new privacy preservation protocol for protocols in asynchronous communication models with Byzantine aggregators. In this protocol, clients mask their values and add Gaussian noise to their models. In contrast with previous works, we use the replicated servers to unmask the models, while ensuring the liveness of training even if aggregators misbehave. Third, the asynchronous communication model introduces new challenges not present in existing approaches. In such a setting, faster clients may contribute more frequently, potentially reducing their privacy and biasing the training. To address this, we introduce an inclusion mechanism that ensures uniform client participation and balanced privacy budgets. Interestingly, the solution presented in this paper does not rely on agreement between aggregators.

Recent unsupervised post-hoc methods for post-trained LMs (PoLMs) mitigate this by aligning PoLM confidence to that of well-calibrated pre-trained counterparts. However, framing calibration as static output-distribution matching overlooks the inference-time dynamics introduced by post-training. In particular, we show that calibration errors arise from two regimes: (i) confidence drift, where final confidence inflates despite largely consistent intermediate decision processes, and (ii) process drift, where intermediate inference pathways diverge. Guided by this diagnosis, we propose Dual-Align, an unsupervised post-hoc framework for dual alignment in confidence calibration. Dual-Align performs confidence alignment to correct confidence drift via final-distribution matching, and introduces process alignment to address process drift by locating the layer where trajectories diverge and realigning the stability of subsequent inference. This dual strategy learns a single temperature parameter that corrects both drift types without sacrificing post-training performance gains.

These systems are compounded by specialized agents, which collaborate through explicit communication, but incur substantial computational overhead. A natural question arises: can we achieve similar modularity benefits with a single agent that selects from a library of skills? We explore this question by viewing skills as internalized agent behaviors. From this perspective, a multi-agent system can be compiled into an equivalent single-agent system, trading inter-agent communication for skill selection. Our preliminary experiments suggest this approach can substantially reduce token usage and latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, this efficiency raises a deeper question that has received little attention: how does skill selection scale as libraries grow?\n  Drawing on principles from cognitive science, we propose that LLM skill selection exhibits bounded capacity analogous to human decision-making. We investigate the scaling behavior of skill selection and observe a striking pattern. Rather than degrading gradually, selection accuracy remains stable up to a critical library size, then drops sharply, indicating a phase transition reminiscent of capacity limits in human cognition. Furthermore, we find evidence that semantic confusability among similar skills, rather than library size alone, plays a central role in this degradation. This perspective suggests that hierarchical organization, which has long helped humans manage complex choices, may similarly benefit AI systems. Our initial results with hierarchical routing support this hypothesis. This work opens new questions about the fundamental limits of semantic-based skill selection in LLMs and offers a cognitive-grounded framework and practical guidelines for designing scalable skill-based agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Nalar preserves full Python expressiveness, using lightweight auto-generated stubs that turn agent and tool invocations into futures carrying dependency and context metadata. A managed state layer decouples logical state from physical placement, enabling safe reuse, migration, and consistent retry behavior. A two-level control architecture combines global policy computation with local event-driven enforcement to support adaptive routing, scheduling, and resource management across evolving workflows.

By embedding adversarial instructions into the results of tool calls, attackers can hijack the agent's decision-making process to execute unauthorized actions. This vulnerability poses a significant risk as agents gain more direct control over physical environments. Existing defense mechanisms against Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) generally fall into two categories. The first involves training dedicated detection models; however, this approach entails high computational overhead for both training and inference, and requires frequent updates to keep pace with evolving attack vectors. Alternatively, prompt-based methods leverage the inherent capabilities of LLMs to detect or ignore malicious instructions via prompt engineering. Despite their flexibility, most current prompt-based defenses suffer from high Attack Success Rates (ASR), demonstrating limited robustness against sophisticated injection attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel method that provides LLMs with precise data via tool result parsing while effectively filtering out injected malicious code.

Intelligence is defined as the capacity to form and integrate causal connections between signals, actions, and internal states. Through context enrichment, systems interpret incoming information using learned relational structure that provides essential context in an efficient representation that the raw input itself does not contain, enabling efficient processing under metabolic constraints.\n  Building on this foundation, we introduce the systems-explaining-systems principle, where consciousness emerges when recursive architectures allow higher-order systems to learn and interpret the relational patterns of lower-order systems across time. These interpretations are integrated into a dynamically stabilized meta-state and fed back through context enrichment, transforming internal models from representations of the external world into models of the system's own cognitive processes.\n  The framework reframes predictive processing as an emergent consequence of contextual interpretation rather than explicit forecasting and suggests that recursive multi-system architectures may be necessary for more human-like artificial intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

It involves the sharing and fusion of information among sensors to overcome the limitations of individual perception, such as blind spots and range limitations. However, CP faces two primary challenges. First, due to the dynamic nature of the environment, the timeliness of the transmitted information is critical to perception performance. Second, with limited computational power at the sensors and constrained wireless bandwidth, the communication volume must be carefully designed to ensure feature representations are both effective and sufficient. This work studies the dynamic scheduling problem in a multi-region CP scenario, and presents a Timeliness-Aware Multi-region Prioritized (TAMP) scheduling algorithm to trade-off perception accuracy and communication resource usage. Timeliness reflects the utility of information that decays as time elapses, which is manifested by the perception performance in CP tasks. We propose an empirical penalty function that maps the joint impact of Age of Information (AoI) and communication volume to perception performance. Aiming to minimize this timeliness-oriented penalty in the long-term, and recognizing that scheduling decisions have a cumulative effect on subsequent system states, we propose the TAMP scheduling algorithm. TAMP is a Lyapunov-based optimization policy that decomposes the long-term average objective into a per-slot prioritization problem, balancing the scheduling worth against resource cost. We validate our algorithm in both intersection and corridor scenarios with the real-world Roadside Cooperative perception (RCooper) dataset. Extensive simulations demonstrate that TAMP outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an Average Precision (AP) improvement of up to 27% across various configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing machine unlearning methods face three challenges in learning to forget identity of generative models: 1) inefficient, where identity erasure requires fine-tuning all the model's parameters; 2) limited controllability, where forgetting intensity cannot be controlled and explainability is lacking; 3) catastrophic collapse, where the model's retention capability undergoes drastic degradation as forgetting progresses. Forgetting has typically been handled through discrete and unstable updates, often requiring full-model fine-tuning and leading to catastrophic collapse. In this work, we argue that identity forgetting should be modeled as a continuous trajectory, and introduce LEGATO - Learn to ForgEt Identity in GenerAtive Models via Trajectory-consistent Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. LEGATO augments pre-trained generators with fine-tunable lightweight Neural ODE adapters, enabling smooth, controllable forgetting while keeping the original model weights frozen. This formulation allows forgetting intensity to be precisely modulated via ODE step size, offering interpretability and robustness. To further ensure stability, we introduce trajectory consistency constraints that explicitly prevent catastrophic collapse during unlearning. Extensive experiments across in-domain and out-of-domain identity unlearning benchmarks show that LEGATO achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance, avoids catastrophic collapse and reduces fine-tuned parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we show how automated common-sense reasoning technology can be deployed in situations where there are not enough data samples available to train a deep learning-based AV model that can handle certain abnormal road scenarios. Specifically, we consider two situations where (i) a traffic signal is malfunctioning at an intersection and (ii) all the cars ahead are slowing down and steering away due to an unexpected obstruction (e.g., animals on the road). We show that in such situations, our commonsense reasoning-based solution accurately detects traffic light colors and obstacles not correctly captured by the AV's perception model. We also provide a pathway for efficiently invoking commonsense reasoning by measuring uncertainty in the computer vision model and using commonsense reasoning to handle uncertain scenarios.

This paper proposes MQ-GNN, a multi-queue pipelined framework that maximizes training efficiency by interleaving GNN training stages and optimizing resource utilization. MQ-GNN introduces Ready-to-Update Asynchronous Consistent Model (RaCoM), which enables asynchronous gradient sharing and model updates while ensuring global consistency through adaptive periodic synchronization. Additionally, it employs global neighbor sampling with caching to reduce data transfer overhead and an adaptive queue-sizing strategy to balance computation and memory efficiency. Experiments on four large-scale datasets and ten baseline models demonstrate that MQ-GNN achieves up to \\boldmath $\\bm{4.6\\,\\times}$ faster training time and 30% improved GPU utilization while maintaining competitive accuracy.

We identify a previously under-emphasized failure mode: models that achieve high in-distribution accuracy can fail catastrophically when the same expression is shifted to different absolute character positions (\"position shift\") or presented under out-of-distribution natural-language templates. Using a disjoint-pair split over all ordered pairs for p=97, we show that a baseline model reaches strong in-distribution performance yet collapses under position shift and template OOD. We then introduce a simple training recipe that combines (i) explicit expression boundary markers, (ii) position curriculum that broadens the range of absolute positions seen during training, (iii) diverse template mixtures, and (iv) consistency training across multiple variants per example. Across three seeds, this intervention substantially improves robustness to position shift and template OOD while maintaining high in-distribution accuracy, whereas an ALiBi-style ablation fails to learn the task under our setup. Our results suggest that steering procedural generalization under noisy supervision benefits from explicitly training invariances that are otherwise absent from the data distribution, and we provide a reproducible evaluation protocol and artifacts.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

One promising approach is to extend the rehabilitation with self-initiated robot-assisted movement therapy. To enable this, it is required to detect the patient's intention to move to trigger the assistance of a robotic device. This intention to move can be detected from human surface electroencephalography (EEG) signals; however, it is particularly challenging to decode when classifications are performed online and asynchronously. In this work, the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing technique was investigated to enhance the robustness of such asynchronous classification. Approach: To investigate the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing, two EEG datasets with 14 healthy subjects who performed self-initiated arm movements were analyzed. Offline and pseudo-online evaluations were conducted to compare ensemble combinations of the support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and EEGNet classification models. Results: The results of the pseudo-online evaluation show that the two model ensembles significantly outperformed the best single model for the optimal number of postprocessing windows. In particular, for single models, an increased number of postprocessing windows significantly improved classification performances. Interestingly, we found no significant improvements between performances of the best single model and classifier ensembles in the offline evaluation. Significance: We demonstrated that classifier ensembles and appropriate postprocessing methods effectively enhance the asynchronous detection of movement intentions from EEG signals. In particular, the classifier ensemble approach yields greater improvements in online classification than in offline classification, and reduces false detections, i.e., early false positives.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper introduces digital drawing as a rich and underexplored modality for affective sensing. We present a novel multimodal framework, named ArtCognition, for the automated analysis of the House-Tree-Person (HTP) test, a widely used psychological instrument. ArtCognition uniquely fuses two distinct data streams: static visual features from the final artwork, captured by computer vision models, and dynamic behavioral kinematic cues derived from the drawing process itself, such as stroke speed, pauses, and smoothness. To bridge the gap between low-level features and high-level psychological interpretation, we employ a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. This grounds the analysis in established psychological knowledge, enhancing explainability and reducing the potential for model hallucination. Our results demonstrate that the fusion of visual and behavioral kinematic cues provides a more nuanced assessment than either modality alone. We show significant correlations between the extracted multimodal features and standardized psychological metrics, validating the framework's potential as a scalable tool to support clinicians.

This study proposes an explainable deep learning framework that integrates continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data with laboratory profiles to learn multimodal temporal embeddings of individual metabolic status. Temporal dependencies across modalities are modeled using a transformer encoder, while latent metabolic phenotypes are identified via Gaussian mixture modeling. Model interpretability is achieved through transformer attention visualization and SHAP-based feature attribution. Five latent metabolic phenotypes, ranging from metabolic stability to elevated cardiometabolic risk, were identified among 577 individuals with T1D. These phenotypes exhibit distinct biochemical profiles, including differences in glycemic control, lipid metabolism, renal markers, and thyrotropin (TSH) levels.

While research has thoroughly investigated the impact of test set contamination on discriminative evaluations like multiple-choice question-answering, comparatively little research has studied the impact of test set contamination on generative evaluations. In this work, we quantitatively assess the effect of test set contamination on generative evaluations through the language model lifecycle. We pretrain language models on mixtures of web data and the MATH benchmark, sweeping model sizes and number of test set replicas contaminating the pretraining corpus; performance improves with contamination and model size. Using scaling laws, we make a surprising discovery: including even a single test set replica enables models to achieve lower loss than the irreducible error of training on the uncontaminated corpus. We then study further training: overtraining with fresh data reduces the effects of contamination, whereas supervised finetuning on the training set can either increase or decrease performance on test data, depending on the amount of pretraining contamination. Finally, at inference, we identify factors that modulate memorization: high sampling temperatures mitigate contamination effects, and longer solutions are exponentially more difficult to memorize than shorter ones, presenting a contrast with discriminative evaluations, where solutions are only a few tokens in length. By characterizing how generation and memorization interact, we highlight a new layer of complexity for trustworthy evaluation of AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u6c61\u67d3\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u5c11\u91cf\u6c61\u67d3\u4e5f\u80fd\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u635f\u5931\u4f4e\u4e8e\u65e0\u6c61\u67d3\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u5982\u4f55\u8c03\u8282\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u524d\u6cbfAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7f51\u9875\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u6c61\u67d3\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u5982\u9009\u62e9\u9898\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6c61\u67d3\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u6c61\u67d3\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u5bf9\u7f3a\u4e4f\u3002", "method": "\u5728MATH\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u526f\u672c\u6c61\u67d3\u91cf\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5206\u6790\u6c61\u67d3\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u65b0\u9c9c\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u5bf9\u6c61\u67d3\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u8c03\u8282\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u6e29\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u751f\u6210\u957f\u5ea6\u5bf9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u6c61\u67d3\u91cf\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u5355\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u526f\u672c\u4e5f\u80fd\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u635f\u5931\u4f4e\u4e8e\u65e0\u6c61\u67d3\u4e0d\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u51cf\u8f7b\u6c61\u67d3\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6c61\u67d3\u91cf\uff1b\u9ad8\u6e29\u91c7\u6837\u7f13\u89e3\u6c61\u67d3\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u957f\u6587\u672c\u6bd4\u77ed\u6587\u672c\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u66f4\u96be\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63cf\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4fe1\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u65b0\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u6c61\u67d3\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u672c\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

Recent work shows that LLMs can engage in multi-turn negotiation, yet nearly all evaluations occur exclusively in English. Using controlled multi-agent simulations across Ultimatum, Buy-Sell, and Resource Exchange games, we systematically isolate language effects across English and four Indic framings (Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marwadi) by holding game rules, model parameters, and incentives constant across all conditions. We find that language choice can shift outcomes more strongly than changing models, reversing proposer advantages and reallocating surplus.

In this setting, the target variable is observed in the source domain but is entirely missing in the target domain. We aim to impute the target variable in the target domain from the remaining observed variables under various shifts. We frame this as learning a compact, mechanism-stable representation. This representation preserves information relevant for predicting the target while discarding spurious variation. For linear Gaussian causal models, we derive a closed-form Gaussian Information Bottleneck (GIB) solution. This solution reduces to a canonical correlation analysis (CCA)-style projection and offers Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-aware options when desired. For nonlinear or non-Gaussian data, we introduce a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) encoder-predictor. This approach scales to high dimensions and can be trained on source data and deployed zero-shot to the target domain. Across synthetic and real datasets, our approach consistently attains accurate imputations, supporting practical use in high-dimensional causal models and furnishing a unified, lightweight toolkit for causal domain adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u56e0\u679c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f53\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\u5728\u6e90\u57df\u4e2d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u800c\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e2d\u5b8c\u5168\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u8868\u793a\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9886\u57df\u9002\u914d\u4e2d\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u5e38\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e2d\u5b8c\u5168\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u4ec5\u80fd\u4ece\u5176\u4ed6\u89c2\u6d4b\u53d8\u91cf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u65ad\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5404\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7edf\u4e00\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u7a33\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u540c\u65f6\u5254\u9664\u865a\u5047\u53d8\u5f02\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u63d2\u8865\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u95ed\u5f0f\u9ad8\u65af\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\uff08GIB\uff09\u89e3\uff0c\u8be5\u89e3\u53ef\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u5178\u578b\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u6790\uff08CCA\uff09\u5f0f\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\uff08DAG\uff09\u611f\u77e5\u9009\u9879\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6216\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u53d8\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\uff08VIB\uff09\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e8e\u6e90\u57df\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u53ef\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u5747\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\u63d2\u8865\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u56e0\u679c\u9886\u57df\u9002\u914d\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u673a\u5236\u7a33\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u9002\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e2d\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002\u6240\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u548c\u53d8\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5747\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional methods struggle with overlapping concerns and create broad, static clusters that degrade over time. Reclustering disrupts continuity, making issue tracking difficult. We propose an adaptive system that segments multi turn chats into service specific concerns and incrementally refines clusters as new issues arise. Cluster quality is tracked via DaviesBouldin Index and Silhouette Scores, with LLM based splitting applied only to degraded clusters.

Such representations lack explicit modular structure, limiting behavioral interpretation. We investigate whether programmatic policies (PERL), implemented as soft, differentiable decision lists (SDDL), can match the performance of NERL. To support reproducible evaluation, we provide the first fully specified and open-source reimplementation of the classic 1992 Artificial Life (ALife) ERL testbed. We conduct a rigorous survival analysis across 4000 independent trials utilizing Kaplan-Meier curves and Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) metrics absent in the original study. We find a statistically significant difference in survival probability between PERL and NERL. PERL agents survive on average 201.69 steps longer than NERL agents. Moreover, SDDL agents using learning alone (no evolution) survive on average 73.67 steps longer than neural agents using both learning and evaluation. These results demonstrate that programmatic policies can exceed the survival performance of neural policies in ALife.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Prior work that uses the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) has focused mostly on single-group bias along warmth and competence. We broaden that lens to intersectional bias by building compound representations for pairs of social identities through summation or concatenation, and by applying three debiasing strategies: Subtraction, Linear Projection, and Partial Projection. We study three widely used embedding families (Word2Vec, GloVe, and ConceptNet Numberbatch) and assess them with two complementary views of utility: whether local neighborhoods remain coherent and whether analogy behavior is preserved. Across models, SCM-based mitigation carries over well to the intersectional case and largely keeps the overall semantic landscape intact. The main cost is a familiar trade off: methods that most tightly preserve geometry tend to be more cautious about analogy behavior, while more assertive projections can improve analogies at the expense of strict neighborhood stability. Partial Projection is reliably conservative and keeps representations steady; Linear Projection can be more assertive; Subtraction is a simple baseline that remains competitive. The choice between summation and concatenation depends on the embedding family and the application goal. Together, these findings suggest that intersectional debiasing with SCM is practical in static embeddings, and they offer guidance for selecting aggregation and debiasing settings when balancing stability against analogy performance.", "AI": {"tldr":

We term this Transitive Expert Error (TEE), distinct from Dunning-Kruger effects, requiring calibrated expertise as precondition. Mechanisms enabling reliable within-domain judgment become liabilities when structural similarity masks causal divergence. Two core mechanisms operate: structural similarity bias causes experts to overweight surface features (shared vocabulary, patterns, formal structure) while missing causal architecture differences; authority persistence maintains confidence across competence boundaries through social reinforcement and metacognitive failures (experts experience no subjective uncertainty as pattern recognition operates smoothly on familiar-seeming inputs.) These mechanism intensify under three conditions: shared vocabulary masking divergent processes, social pressure for immediate judgment, and delayed feedback. These findings extend to AI routing architectures (MoE systems, multi-model orchestration, tool-using agents, RAG systems) exhibiting routing-induced failures (wrong specialist selected) and coverage-induced failures (no appropriate specialist exists). Both produce a hallucination phenotype: confident, coherent, structurally plausible but causally incorrect outputs at domain boundaries. In human systems where mechanisms are cognitive black boxes; AI architectures make them explicit and addressable. We propose interventions: multi-expert activation with disagreement detection (router level), boundary-aware calibration (specialist level), and coverage gap detection (training level). TEE has detectable signatures (routing patterns, confidence-accuracy dissociations, domain-inappropriate content) enabling monitoring and mitigation. What remains intractable in human cognition becomes addressable through architectural design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u4f20\u9012\u6027\u4e13\u5bb6\u9519\u8bef\uff08TEE\uff09\u201d\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u9610\u8ff0\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u5904\u56e0\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u6743\u5a01\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u673a\u5236\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eAI\u8def\u7531\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u5185\u63d0\u5347\u5224\u65ad\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u5904\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002\u4f20\u7edfDunning-Kruger\u6548\u5e94\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u6821\u51c6\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u4e13\u5bb6\u5728\u9886\u57df\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u5927\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff1a1.\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u2014\u2014\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fc7\u5ea6\u91cd\u89c6\u8868\u9762\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u56e0\u679c\u67b6\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b2.\u6743\u5a01\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u2014\u2014\u8de8\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\u7ef4\u6301\u4fe1\u5fc3\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e09\u79cd\u5f3a\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\uff1a\u5171\u4eab\u8bcd\u6c47\u63a9\u76d6\u5dee\u5f02\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u538b\u529b\u8981\u6c42\u5373\u65f6\u5224\u65ad\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53cd\u9988\u3002\u5c06\u7406\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\u5230AI\u8def\u7531\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8def\u7531\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5931\u8d25\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0TEE\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\uff1a\u8def\u7531\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6-\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5206\u79bb\u3001\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u9002\u5f53\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff1a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0e\u5206\u6b67\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u4e13\u4e1a\u7ea7\u8fb9\u754c\u611f\u77e5\u6821\u51c6\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ea7\u8986\u76d6\u95f4\u9699\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7684TEE\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728AI\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u5bfb\u5740\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u4ee5\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u539f\u672c\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u9ed1\u7bb1\u7684\u673a\u5236\u53d8\u5f97\u660e\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u3002"}}

These tasks are significantly more dynamic than predefined structures, posing new challenges to the current structured generation engines. In this paper, we propose XGrammar 2, a highly optimized structured generation engine for agentic LLMs. XGrammar 2 accelerates the mask generation for these dynamic structured generation tasks through a new dynamic dispatching semantics: TagDispatch. We further introduce a just-in-time (JIT) compilation method to reduce compilation time and a cross-grammar caching mechanism to leverage the common sub-structures across different grammars.

RLV$^\\varepsilon$R: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Noisy Rewards", "comment": null, "summary": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a simple but powerful paradigm for training LLMs: sample a completion, verify it, and update. In practice, however, the verifier is almost never clean--unit tests probe only limited corner cases; human and synthetic labels are imperfect; and LLM judges (e.g., RLAIF) are noisy and can be exploited--and this problem worsens on harder domains (especially coding) where tests are sparse and increasingly model-generated. We ask a pragmatic question: does the verification noise merely slow down the learning (rate), or can it flip the outcome (fate)?\n  To address this, we develop an analytically tractable multi-armed bandit view of RLVR dynamics, instantiated with GRPO and validated in controlled experiments. Modeling false positives and false negatives and grouping completions into recurring reasoning modes yields a replicator-style (natural-selection) flow on the probability simplex. The dynamics decouples into within-correct-mode competition and a one-dimensional evolution for the mass on incorrect modes, whose drift is determined solely by Youden's index J=TPR-FPR. This yields a sharp phase transition: when J>0, the incorrect mass is driven toward extinction (learning); when J=0, the process is neutral; and when J<0, incorrect modes amplify until they dominate (anti-learning and collapse). In the learning regime J>0, noise primarily rescales convergence time (\"rate, not fate\"). Experiments on verifiable programming tasks under synthetic noise reproduce the predicted J=0 boundary. Beyond noise, the framework offers a general lens for analyzing RLVR stability, convergence, and algorithmic interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

But AI systems, we argue, will not be able to comply with these regulations at the necessary speed and scale by continuing to rely on traditional, analogue methods of compliance. Instead, we posit that compliance with these regulations will only realistically be achieved computationally: that is, with algorithms that run across the life cycle of an AI system, automatically steering it toward AIR compliance in the face of dynamic conditions. Yet despite their (we would argue) inevitability, the research community has yet to specify exactly how these algorithms for computational AIR compliance should behave - or how we should benchmark their performance. To fill these gaps, we specify a set of design goals for such algorithms. In addition, we specify a benchmark dataset that can be used to quantitatively measure whether individual algorithms satisfy these design goals.

While recent work has begun to explore unlearning in quantum machine learning, existing approaches largely rely on fixed, uniform target distributions and do not explicitly control the trade-off between forgetting and retained model behaviour. In this work, we propose a distribution-guided framework for class-level quantum machine unlearning that treats unlearning as a constrained optimization problem. Our method introduces a tunable target distribution derived from model similarity statistics, decoupling the suppression of forgotten-class confidence from assumptions about redistribution among retained classes. We further incorporate an anchor-based preservation constraint that explicitly maintains predictive behaviour on selected retained data, yielding a controlled optimization trajectory that limits deviation from the original model. We evaluate the approach on variational quantum classifiers trained on the Iris and Covertype datasets. Results demonstrate sharp suppression of forgotten-class confidence, minimal degradation of retained-class performance, and closer alignment with the gold retrained model baselines compared to uniform-target unlearning.

However, its model training relies heavily on the large-scale labeled data, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To address this challenge, we propose an SEI approach enhanced by active learning (AL), which follows a three-stage semi-supervised training scheme. In the first stage, self-supervised contrastive learning is employed with a dynamic dictionary update mechanism to extract robust representations from large amounts of the unlabeled data. In the second stage, supervised training on a small labeled dataset is performed, where the contrastive and cross-entropy losses are jointly optimized to improve the feature separability and strengthen the classification boundaries. In the third stage, an AL module selects the most valuable samples from the unlabeled data for annotation based on the uncertainty and representativeness criteria, further enhancing generalization under limited labeling budgets. Experimental results on the ADS-B and WiFi datasets demonstrate that the proposed SEI approach significantly outperforms the conventional supervised and semi-supervised methods under limited annotation conditions, achieving higher recognition accuracy with lower labeling cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We develop and explain a predictive model for pLos using admission-level patient and hospital administrative data. The approach includes a feature selection method by selecting non-correlated features with the highest information value. The method uses features weights of evidence to select a representative within cliques from graph theory. The prognosis study analyzed the records from 120,354 hospital admissions at the Hospital Alma Mater de Antioquia between January 2017 and March 2022. After a cleaning process the dataset was split into training (67%), test (22%), and validation (11%) cohorts. A logistic regression model was trained to predict the pLoS in two classes: less than or greater than 7 days. The performance of the model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC-ROC metrics. The feature selection method returns nine interpretable variables, enhancing the models' transparency. In the validation cohort, the pLoS model achieved a specificity of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.82-0.84), sensitivity of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.62-0.65), accuracy of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.76-0.77), precision of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.66-0.69), and AUC-ROC of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.81-0.83).

However, most advancements have focused on individualized problem-solving instead of collaborative, open-ended problem-solving, which may offer both affordances (richer data) and challenges (low cohesion) to behavioral prediction. Here, we extend predictive models to automatically detect socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) behaviors in collaborative computational modeling environments using embedding-based approaches. We leverage large language models (LLMs) as summarization tools to generate task-aware representations of student dialogue aligned with system logs. These summaries, combined with text-only embeddings, context-enriched embeddings, and log-derived features, were used to train predictive models. Results show that text-only embeddings often achieve stronger performance in detecting SSRL behaviors related to enactment or group dynamics (e.g., off-task behavior or requesting assistance). In contrast, contextual and multimodal features provide complementary benefits for constructs such as planning and reflection. Overall, our findings highlight the promise of embedding-based models for extending learning analytics by enabling scalable detection of SSRL behaviors, ultimately supporting real-time feedback and adaptive scaffolding in collaborative learning environments that teachers value.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Accurate predictions emerge from a sequence of geometric transformations: token lengths are accumulated into character count manifolds, attention heads twist these manifolds to estimate distance to the line boundary, and the decision to break the line is enabled by arranging estimates orthogonally to create a linear decision boundary.

Existing biomedical datasets focus on general or coarsegrained knowledge and thus fail to support the fine-grained experimental reasoning demanded by HID and MSR.

We evaluate information extraction methods on BioPIE, and implement a QA system that leverages BioPIE, showcasing performance gains on test, HID, and MSR question sets, showing that the structured experimental knowledge in BioPIE underpins both AI-assisted and more autonomous biomedical experimentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "BioPIE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u534f\u8bae\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6765\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u6216\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u4ea4\u6d41\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBiomedical Protocol Information Extraction Dataset (BioPIE)\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4ee5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u4f53\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728BioPIE\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u3001\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "BioPIE\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e3aAI\u8f85\u52a9\u53ca\u66f4\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

We present IGENBENCH, the first benchmark for evaluating the reliability of text-to-infographic generation, comprising 600 curated test cases spanning 30 infographic types. We design an automated evaluation framework that decomposes reliability verification into atomic yes/no questions based on a taxonomy of 10 question types.

Long term operation of such AI enabled human centric applications can expose them to corner cases for which their operation is may be uncertain. This can be due to many reasons such as inherent flaws in the design, limited resources for testing, inherent computational limitations of the testing methodology, or unknown use cases resulting from human interaction with the system. Such untested corner cases or cases for which the system performance is uncertain can lead to violations in the safety, sustainability, and security requirements of the system.

While this design enables autonomy, it also expands the attack surface for backdoor threats. Backdoor triggers injected into specific stages of an agent workflow can persist through multiple intermediate states and adversely influence downstream outputs. However, existing studies remain fragmented and typically analyze individual attack vectors in isolation, leaving the cross-stage interaction and propagation of backdoor triggers poorly understood from an agent-centric perspective. To fill this gap, we propose \\textbf{BackdoorAgent}, a modular and stage-aware framework that provides a unified, agent-centric view of backdoor threats in LLM agents. BackdoorAgent structures the attack surface into three functional stages of agentic workflows, including \\textbf{planning attacks}, \\textbf{memory attacks}, and \\textbf{tool-use attacks}, and instruments agent execution to enable systematic analysis of trigger activation and propagation across different stages.

Unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT), RLVR lets an LLM generate multiple candidate solutions and reinforces those that lead to a verifiably correct final answer. However, in practice, RLVR often requires thousands of training steps to reach strong performance, incurring substantial computation largely attributed to prolonged exploration. In this work, we make a surprising observation: during RLVR, LLMs evolve in a strongly linear manner. Specifically, both model weights and model output log-probabilities exhibit strong linear correlations with RL training steps. This suggests that RLVR predominantly amplifies trends that emerge early in training, rather than continuously discovering new behaviors throughout the entire optimization trajectory. Motivated by this linearity, we investigate whether future model states can be predicted from intermediate checkpoints via extrapolation, avoiding continued expensive training. We show that Weight Extrapolation produces models with performance comparable to standard RL training while requiring significantly less computation. Moreover, Logits Extrapolation consistently outperforms continued RL training on all four benchmarks by extrapolating beyond the step range where RL training remains stable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5728RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u5448\u73b0\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6f14\u8fdb\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u6743\u91cd\u5916\u63a8\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u5916\u63a8\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u540c\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u6bd4\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u867d\u7136\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u6570\u5343\u6b65\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u65f6\u95f4\u6d88\u8017\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u6f14\u8fdb\u5448\u73b0\u5f3a\u70c8\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u542f\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u63a8\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u72b6\u6001\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u6f14\u8fdb\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u5916\u63a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u6743\u91cd\u5916\u63a8\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u4e2d\u95f4\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u5916\u63a8\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u903b\u8f91\u5916\u63a8\u5728\u5916\u63a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5019\u9009\u54cd\u5e94\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u6743\u91cd\u5916\u63a8\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff1b\u903b\u8f91\u5916\u63a8\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ee7\u7eedRL\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u5916\u63a8\u5230RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u5931\u6548\u7684\u6b65\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "conclusion": "RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u5916\u63a8\u6210\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We optimize CIEA using two complementary contrastive losses to ensure semantic integrity and effectively capture the complementary information contained in images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CIEA, which achieves significant improvements over both divide-and-conquer models and universal dense retrieval models.

We use this recipe to systematically examine the scaling laws of behavior cloning to understand how the model's performance and causal reasoning varies with model and data scale.

Yet, artificial intelligence has primarily advanced in digital modalities like text, vision, and audio. This paper outlines a research vision for multisensory artificial intelligence over the next decade. This new set of technologies can change how humans and AI experience and interact with one another, by connecting AI to the human senses and a rich spectrum of signals from physiological and tactile cues on the body, to physical and social signals in homes, cities, and the environment. We outline how this field must advance through three interrelated themes of sensing, science, and synergy. Firstly, research in sensing should extend how AI captures the world in richer ways beyond the digital medium.

Among advanced imputation methods, score-based diffusion models have demonstrated competitive performance. These models generate data by reversing a noising process, using observed values as conditional guidance. However, existing diffusion models typically apply a uniform guidance scale across both spatial and temporal dimensions, which is inadequate for nodes with high missing data rates. Sparse observations provide insufficient conditional guidance, causing the generative process to drift toward the learned prior distribution rather than closely following the conditional observations, resulting in suboptimal imputation performance.\n  To address this, we propose FENCE, a spatial-temporal feedback diffusion guidance method designed to adaptively control guidance scales during imputation. First, FENCE introduces a dynamic feedback mechanism that adjusts the guidance scale based on the posterior likelihood approximations. The guidance scale is increased when generated values diverge from observations and reduced when alignment improves, preventing overcorrection. Second, because alignment to observations varies across nodes and denoising steps, a global guidance scale for all nodes is suboptimal. FENCE computes guidance scales at the cluster level by grouping nodes based on their attention scores, leveraging spatial-temporal correlations to provide more accurate guidance. Experimental results on real-world traffic datasets show that FENCE significantly enhances imputation accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our results show that machine learning models provide good accuracy rates, but their confidence levels vary significantly. Human evaluators, on the other hand, use a greater variety of language signs and retain more consistent confidence.

Through experiments on healthcare datasets (SLEEP, UCI-HAR, and PAMAP2), FedKDX demonstrates improved accuracy (up to 2.53% over state-of-the-art methods), faster convergence, and better performance on non-IID data distributions. Theoretical analysis supports NKD's contribution to addressing statistical heterogeneity in distributed healthcare data.

While these approaches can raise aggregate scores, they often yield unstable and hard-to-audit improvement trajectories, making it difficult to guarantee non-regression or to reason about failures across versions. We reframe agent improvement as \\textbf{release engineering}: agents are treated as shippable artifacts, and improvement is externalized into a regression-aware release pipeline. We introduce \\textbf{AgentDevel}, a release engineering pipeline that iteratively runs the current agent, produces implementation-blind, symptom-level quality signals from execution traces, synthesizes a single release candidate (RC) via executable diagnosis, and promotes it under flip-centered gating. AgentDevel features three core designs: (i) an implementation-blind LLM critic that characterizes failure appearances without accessing agent internals, (ii) script-based executable diagnosis that aggregates dominant symptom patterns and produces auditable engineering specifications, and (iii) flip-centered gating that prioritizes pass to fail regressions and fail to pass fixes as first-class evidence. Unlike population-based search or in-agent self-refinement, AgentDevel maintains a single canonical version line and emphasizes non-regression as a primary objective. Experiments on execution-heavy benchmarks demonstrate that AgentDevel yields stable improvements with significantly fewer regressions while producing reproducible, auditable artifacts.

However, several phenomena remain poorly understood, including the reduction in output diversity. To gain a broader understanding of RL post-training, we analyze the learning dynamics of RL post-training from a perspective that has been studied in supervised learning but remains underexplored in RL. We adopt an empirical neural tangent kernel (NTK) framework and decompose the NTK into two components to characterize how RL updates propagate across training samples. Our analysis reveals that limited variability in feature representations can cause RL updates to systematically increase model confidence, providing an explanation for the commonly observed reduction in output diversity after RL post-training. Furthermore, we show that effective learning in this regime depends on rapidly shaping the classifier, which directly affects the gradient component of the NTK. Motivated by these insights, we propose classifier-first reinforcement learning (CF-RL), a simple two-stage training strategy that prioritizes classifier updates before standard RL optimization. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis by demonstrating increased model confidence and accelerated optimization under CF-RL. Additional analysis shows that the mechanism underlying CF-RL differs from that of linear-probing-then-fine-tuning in supervised learning.

This paper focuses on estimating causal effects in Gaussian Linear Structural Causal Models (GL-SCMs), which are widely used due to their analytical tractability. However, parameter estimation in GL-SCMs is often infeasible with finite data, primarily due to overparameterization. To address this, we introduce the class of Centralized Gaussian Linear SCMs (CGL-SCMs), a simplified yet expressive subclass where exogenous variables follow standardized distributions. We show that CGL-SCMs are equally expressive in terms of causal effect identifiability from observational distributions and present a novel EM-based estimation algorithm that can learn CGL-SCM parameters and estimate identifiable causal effects from finite observational samples. Our theoretical analysis is validated through experiments on synthetic data and benchmark causal graphs, demonstrating that the learned models accurately recover causal distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address these issues, we propose InstruCoT, a model enhancement method for PI defense that synthesizes diverse training data and employs instruction-level chain-of-thought fine-tuning, enabling LLMs to effectively identify and reject malicious instructions regardless of their source or position in the context.

In this work, we propose a simple yet effective solution that projects user and item embeddings, learned from collaborative filtering, into the LLM token space via separate lightweight projector modules. A finetuned LLM then conditions on these projected embeddings alongside textual tokens to generate recommendations.

While existing works have studied the adversarial attacks and corresponding defense strategies, they mainly focus on reactively detecting and mitigating attacks after they occur rather than proactively designing inherently resilient systems. In this work, we study the resilience of LLM-based MAS under perturbations and find that both the communication topology and prompt design significantly influence system resilience. Motivated by these findings, we propose ResMAS: a two-stage framework for enhancing MAS resilience. First, we train a reward model to predict the MAS's resilience, based on which we train a topology generator to automatically design resilient topology for specific tasks through reinforcement learning. Second, we introduce a topology-aware prompt optimization method that refines each agent's prompt based on its connections and interactions with other agents. Extensive experiments across a range of tasks show that our approach substantially improves MAS resilience under various constraints. Moreover, our framework demonstrates strong generalization ability to new tasks and models, highlighting its potential for building resilient MASs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This study proposes a method that combines a large language model (LLM) and a knowledge graph. First, a fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model is used to perform entity recognition and relationship extraction on multi-source heterogeneous texts, and GPT-4 is used to generate semantically enhanced vector representations; secondly, a two-layer graph neural network (GNN) architecture is designed to fuse the semantic vectors output by LLM with business metadata to construct a dynamic and scalable enterprise knowledge graph; then reinforcement learning is introduced to optimize decision path generation, and the reward function is used to drive the mechanism iteration. In the case of the manufacturing industry, this mechanism reduced the response time for equipment failure scenarios from 7.8 hours to 3.7 hours, the F1 value reached 94.3%, and the compensation for decision errors in the annual digital transformation cost decreased by 45.3%. This method significantly enhances the intelligence level and execution efficiency of the digital transformation driving mechanism by integrating large model semantic understanding with structured knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing travel planning approaches face several challenges: (1) Pruning candidate points of interest (POIs) while maintaining a high recall rate; (2) A single reasoning path restricts the exploration capability within the feasible solution space for travel planning; (3) Simultaneously optimizing hard constraints and soft constraints remains a significant difficulty. To address these challenges, we propose TourPlanner, a comprehensive framework featuring multi-path reasoning and constraint-gated reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first introduce a Personalized Recall and Spatial Optimization (PReSO) workflow to construct spatially-aware candidate POIs' set. Subsequently, we propose Competitive consensus Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), a multi-path reasoning paradigm that improves the ability of exploring the feasible solution space. To further refine the plan, we integrate a sigmoid-based gating mechanism into the reinforcement learning stage, which dynamically prioritizes soft-constraint satisfaction only after hard constraints are met. Experimental results on travel planning benchmarks demonstrate that TourPlanner achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing existing methods in both feasibility and user-preference alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We develop a formal information-theoretic framework for quantifying how much predictive structure fine-tuning extracts from the train dataset and writes into a model's parameters. Our central quantity, Excess Description Length (EDL), is defined via prequential coding and measures the gap between the bits required to encode training labels sequentially using an evolving model (trained online) and the residual encoding cost under the final trained model. We establish that EDL is non-negative in expectation, converges to surplus description length in the infinite-data limit, and provides bounds on expected generalization gain. Through a series of toy models, we clarify common confusions about information in learning: why random labels yield EDL near zero, how a single example can eliminate many bits of uncertainty about the underlying rule(s) that describe the data distribution, why structure learned on rare inputs contributes proportionally little to expected generalization, and how format learning creates early transients distinct from capability acquisition.

To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{M-ASK} (Multi-Agent Search and Knowledge), a framework that explicitly decouples agentic search into two complementary roles: Search Behavior Agents, which plan and execute search actions, and Knowledge Management Agents, which aggregate, filter, and maintain a compact internal context. This decomposition allows each agent to focus on a well-defined subtask and reduces interference between search and context construction. Furthermore, to enable stable coordination, M-ASK employs turn-level rewards to provide granular supervision for both search decisions and knowledge updates. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that M-ASK outperforms strong baselines, achieving not only superior answer accuracy but also significantly more stable training dynamics.\\footnote{The source code for M-ASK is available at https://github.com/chenyiqun/M-ASK.}", "code_url": "https://github.com/chenyiqun/M-ASK", "code_stars": 2, "code_last_update": "2026-01-06", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This work aims to continuously forecast the timing of future events by analyzing multi-sensor data streams. A key characteristic of real-world data streams is their dynamic nature, where the underlying patterns evolve over time. To address this, we present TimeCast, a dynamic prediction framework designed to adapt to these changes and provide accurate, real-time predictions of future event time. Our proposed method has the following properties: (a) Dynamic: it identifies the distinct time-evolving patterns (i.e., stages) and learns individual models for each, enabling us to make adaptive predictions based on pattern shifts. (b) Practical: it finds meaningful stages that capture time-varying interdependencies between multiple sensors and improve prediction performance; (c) Scalable: our algorithm scales linearly with the input size and enables online model updates on data streams. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that TimeCast provides higher prediction accuracy than state-of-the-art methods while finding dynamic changes in data streams with a great reduction in computational time.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While large language models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in textual reasoning, their discrete token-based architecture creates fundamental incompatibilities with continuous numerical sequences exhibiting temporal dependencies. Current methodologies inadequately address this modality mismatch, constraining the potential of language model-driven automation in incident management workflows. This paper presents a multimodal diagnostic framework that harmonizes time-series representations with pretrained language model embedding spaces. Our approach contributes three technical advances: (1) a semantic compression technique that distills temporal segments into single-token abstractions while preserving pattern semantics, (2) an alignment encoder utilizing gated cross-attention to project time-series features into language model latent space, and (3) a retrieval-augmented diagnostic pipeline that synthesizes aligned embeddings with historical incident knowledge for expert-level failure attribution. Comprehensive evaluation across six cloud system benchmarks demonstrates that our framework achieves leading performance, reaching 48.75% diagnostic accuracy with notable improvements on scenarios involving compound failure modes.

The model suite includes satellite-based deep learning and optical-flow approaches and physics-based numerical weather prediction models, covering both deterministic and probabilistic formulations. Forecasts are first validated against satellite-derived surface solar irradiance (SSI). Irradiance fields are then converted into PV power using station-specific machine learning models, enabling comparison with production data from 6434 PV stations across Switzerland. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate spatiotemporal PV forecasting at a national scale. We additionally provide the first visualizations of how mesoscale cloud systems shape national PV production on hourly and sub-hourly timescales. Our results show that satellite-based approaches outperform the Integrated Forecast System (IFS-ENS), particularly at short lead times. Among them, SolarSTEPS and SHADECast deliver the most accurate SSI and PV power predictions, with SHADECast providing the most reliable ensemble spread. The deterministic model IrradianceNet achieves the lowest root mean square error, while probabilistic forecasts of SolarSTEPS and SHADECast provide better-calibrated uncertainty.

To make multi-turn rollouts scalable, AgentOCR proposes segment optical caching. By decomposing history into hashable segments and maintaining a visual cache, this mechanism eliminates redundant re-rendering. Beyond fixed rendering, AgentOCR introduces agentic self-compression, where the agent actively emits a compression rate and is trained with compression-aware reward to adaptively balance task success and token efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on challenging agentic benchmarks, ALFWorld and search-based QA. Remarkably, results demonstrate that AgentOCR preserves over 95\\% of text-based agent performance while substantially reducing token consumption (>50\\%), yielding consistent token and memory efficiency.

However, in node classification, computing node-level explainability becomes extremely time-consuming as the size of the graph increases, while batching strategies often degrade explanation quality. This paper introduces a novel approach to parallelizing node-level explainability in GNNs through graph partitioning.

In most environments, information is distributed across isolated files like reports and logs that lack explicit links. Standard search engines process files independently, ignoring the connections between them. Furthermore, manually building Knowledge Graphs is impractical for such vast data. To bridge this gap, we present Orion-RAG. Our core insight is simple yet effective: we do not need heavy algorithms to organize this data. Instead, we use a low-complexity strategy to extract lightweight paths that naturally link related concepts. We demonstrate that this streamlined approach suffices to transform fragmented documents into semi-structured data, enabling the system to link information across different files effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Orion-RAG consistently outperforms mainstream frameworks across diverse domains, supporting real-time updates and explicit Human-in-the-Loop verification with high cost-efficiency.

While machine learning (ML) has been used to support electrospinning process optimisation, most existing approaches predict only mean fibre diameters, neglecting the full diameter distribution that governs scaffold performance. This work presents FibreCastML, an open, distribution-aware ML framework that predicts complete fibre diameter spectra from routinely reported electrospinning parameters and provides interpretable insights into process structure relationships.\n  A meta-dataset comprising 68538 individual fibre diameter measurements extracted from 1778 studies across 16 biomedical polymers was curated. Six standard processing parameters, namely solution concentration, applied voltage, flow rate, tip to collector distance, needle diameter, and collector rotation speed, were used to train seven ML models using nested cross validation with leave one study out external folds. Model interpretability was achieved using variable importance analysis, SHapley Additive exPlanations, correlation matrices, and three dimensional parameter maps.\n  Non linear models consistently outperformed linear baselines, achieving coefficients of determination above 0.91 for several widely used polymers. Solution concentration emerged as the dominant global driver of fibre diameter distributions. Experimental validation across different electrospinning systems demonstrated close agreement between predicted and measured distributions.

In this paper, we present AT$^2$PO (Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization via Tree Search), a unified framework for multi-turn agentic RL that addresses three core challenges: limited exploration diversity, sparse credit assignment, and misaligned policy optimization. AT$^2$PO introduces a turn-level tree structure that jointly enables Entropy-Guided Tree Expansion for strategic exploration and Turn-wise Credit Assignment for fine-grained reward propagation from sparse outcomes. Complementing this, we propose Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization, a turn-level learning objective that aligns policy updates with the natural decision granularity of agentic interactions. ATPO is orthogonal to tree search and can be readily integrated into any multi-turn RL pipeline.

Prior work suggests that stochastic gradient noise induces a Brownian-like expansion of the weight matrices W, whose growth is counteracted by WD, leading to a WD-noise equilibrium with a certain weight norm ||W||. In this work, we view the equilibrium norm as a harmful artifact of the training procedure, and address it by introducing learnable multipliers to learn the optimal scale. First, we attach a learnable scalar multiplier to W and confirm that the WD-noise equilibrium norm is suboptimal: the learned scale adapts to data and improves performance. We then argue that individual row and column norms are similarly constrained, and free their scale by introducing learnable per-row and per-column multipliers. Our method can be viewed as a learnable, more expressive generalization of muP multipliers. It outperforms a well-tuned muP baseline, reduces the computational overhead of multiplier tuning, and surfaces practical questions such as forward-pass symmetries and the width-scaling of the learned multipliers. Finally, we validate learnable multipliers with both Adam and Muon optimizers, where it shows improvement in downstream evaluations matching the improvement of the switching from Adam to Muon.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u5668\u66ff\u4ee3\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u5e73\u8861\u6743\u91cd\u8303\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u884c\u7ea7\u548c\u5217\u7ea7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4e58\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u03bcP\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u964d\u4f4e\u8c03\u53c2\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u5f62\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u5bfc\u81f4\u6743\u91cd\u8303\u6570\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u5e73\u8861\u8303\u6570\u53ef\u80fd\u975e\u6700\u4f18\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u673a\u5236\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u91cd\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635W\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u4e58\u5b50\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u6bcf\u884c\u548c\u6bcf\u5217\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4e58\u5b50\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u89c6\u4e3a\u03bcP\u4e58\u5b50\u66f4\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8eAdam\u548cMuon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4e58\u5b50\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u8c03\u4f18\u826f\u597d\u7684\u03bcP\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e58\u5b50\u8c03\u53c2\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e0b\u6e38\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u4eceAdam\u5207\u6362\u5230Muon\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4e58\u5b50\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u56fa\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u91cd\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8c03\u53c2\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u662f\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this work, we challenge this prevailing consensus through a systematic empirical investigation. Counter-intuitively, we find that models trained on hard-only constraints consistently outperform those trained on mixed datasets. Extensive experiments reveal that reward precision, rather than constraint diversity, is the primary driver of effective alignment. The LLM judge suffers from a low recall rate in detecting false response, which leads to severe reward hacking, thereby undermining the benefits of diversity. Furthermore, analysis of the attention mechanism reveals that high-precision rewards develop a transferable meta-skill for IF. Motivated by these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data-centric refinement strategy that prioritizes reward precision. Evaluated on five benchmarks, our approach outperforms competitive baselines by 13.4\\% in performance while achieving a 58\\% reduction in training time, maintaining strong generalization beyond instruction following.

However, their performance mainly stems from thinking, a long Chain of Thought (CoT), which significantly increase computational overhead. To address this overthinking problem, existing work focuses on using reinforcement learning (RL) to train hybrid reasoning models that automatically decide whether to engage in thinking or not based on the complexity of the query. Unfortunately, using RL will suffer the the reward hacking problem, e.g., the model engages in thinking but is judged as not doing so, resulting in incorrect rewards. To mitigate this problem, existing works either employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which incurs high computational costs, or enforce uniform token limits on non-thinking responses, which yields limited mitigation of the problem. In this paper, we propose Thinking-Based Non-Thinking (TNT). It does not employ SFT, and sets different maximum token usage for responses not using thinking across various queries by leveraging information from the solution component of the responses using thinking. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that TNT reduces token usage by around 50% compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B/7B and DeepScaleR-1.5B, while significantly improving accuracy. In fact, TNT achieves the optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among all tested methods. Additionally, the probability of reward hacking problem in TNT's responses, which are classified as not using thinking, remains below 10% across all tested datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

For a single instance, many valid counterfactuals can exist, which leaves open the possibility for an explanation provider to cherry-pick explanations that better suit a narrative of their choice, highlighting favourable behaviour and withholding examples that reveal problematic behaviour. We formally define cherry-picking for counterfactual explanations in terms of an admissible explanation space, specified by the generation procedure, and a utility function. We then study to what extent an external auditor can detect such manipulation. Considering three levels of access to the explanation process: full procedural access, partial procedural access, and explanation-only access, we show that detection is extremely limited in practice. Even with full procedural access, cherry-picked explanations can remain difficult to distinguish from non cherry-picked explanations, because the multiplicity of valid counterfactuals and flexibility in the explanation specification provide sufficient degrees of freedom to mask deliberate selection. Empirically, we demonstrate that this variability often exceeds the effect of cherry-picking on standard counterfactual quality metrics such as proximity, plausibility, and sparsity, making cherry-picked explanations statistically indistinguishable from baseline explanations.

In practice, RL progress often slows when task difficulty becomes poorly aligned with model capability, or when training is dominated by a narrow set of recurring problem patterns. To jointly address these issues, we propose SCALER (Synthetic sCalable Adaptive Learning Environment for Reasoning), a framework that sustains effective learning signals through adaptive environment design. SCALER introduces a scalable synthesis pipeline that converts real-world programming problems into verifiable reasoning environments with controllable difficulty and unbounded instance generation, enabling RL training beyond finite datasets while preserving strong correctness guarantees. Building on this, SCALER further employs an adaptive multi-environment RL strategy that dynamically adjusts instance difficulty and curates the active set of environments to track the model's capability frontier and maintain distributional diversity. This co-adaptation prevents reward sparsity, mitigates overfitting to narrow task patterns, and supports sustained improvement throughout training. Extensive experiments show that SCALER consistently outperforms dataset-based RL baselines across diverse reasoning benchmarks and exhibits more stable, long-horizon training dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SCALER\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u73af\u5883\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6301\u7eed\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u5f53\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u53d8\u5f97\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\u88ab\u72ed\u7a84\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408", "method": "SCALER\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\uff1a1\uff09\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7f16\u7a0b\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u73af\u5883\uff1b2\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u73af\u5883\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5b9e\u4f8b\u96be\u5ea6\u5e76\u7f16\u6392\u73af\u5883\u96c6\u5408", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aSCALER\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u66f4\u957f\u671f\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001", "conclusion": "SCALER\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u73af\u5883\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u534f\u540c\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6301\u7eed\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7"}}

Object-counting performance is reported using per-field exact-match accuracy and MAPE results, while document-QA performance is reported using overall accuracy and per-category breakdowns with an LLM-as-a-judge scoring pipeline and targeted human adjudication for edge cases. Evaluating a broad set of state-of-the-art models under a unified protocol, we observe a stable capability gradient; OCR and text-centric document QA are strongest (up to 0.95 accuracy), spatial reasoning is moderate, and symbol-centric drawing understanding - especially reliable counting of doors and windows - remains unsolved (often 0.40-0.55 accuracy) with substantial proportional errors.

We propose a Dynamic Rank LoRA framework named DR-LoRA, which dynamically grows expert LoRA ranks during fine-tuning based on task-specific demands. DR-LoRA employs an Expert Saliency Scoring mechanism that integrates expert routing frequency and LoRA rank importance to quantify each expert's demand for additional capacity. Experts with higher saliency scores are prioritized for rank expansion, enabling the automatic formation of a heterogeneous rank distribution tailored to the target task.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer inferential capabilities, they often depend on retrieval-augmented contexts that lack structural depth. Traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) attempt to bridge this gap, yet their pairwise constraints fail to capture the irreducible higher-order interactions that govern emergent physical behavior. To address this, we introduce a methodology for constructing hypergraph-based knowledge representations that faithfully encode multi-entity relationships. Applied to a corpus of ~1,100 manuscripts on biocomposite scaffolds, our framework constructs a global hypergraph of 161,172 nodes and 320,201 hyperedges, revealing a scale-free topology (power law exponent ~1.23) organized around highly connected conceptual hubs. This representation prevents the combinatorial explosion typical of pairwise expansions and explicitly preserves the co-occurrence context of scientific formulations. We further demonstrate that equipping agentic systems with hypergraph traversal tools, specifically using node-intersection constraints, enables them to bridge semantically distant concepts. By exploiting these higher-order pathways, the system successfully generates grounded mechanistic hypotheses for novel composite materials, such as linking cerium oxide to PCL scaffolds via chitosan intermediates. This work establishes a \"teacherless\" agentic reasoning system where hypergraph topology acts as a verifiable guardrail, accelerating scientific discovery by uncovering relationships obscured by traditional graph methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u56fe\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u9636\u4ea4\u4e92\u663e\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u8d85\u8fb9\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u590d\u5408\u6750\u6599\u652f\u67b6\u6587\u732e\u8bed\u6599\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b16\u4e07+\u8282\u70b9\u548c32\u4e07+\u8d85\u8fb9\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u8d85\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u914d\u5907\u8d85\u56fe\u904d\u5386\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u79d1\u5b66\u5173\u8054\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u7ea6\u675f\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u63a7\u5236\u6d8c\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u9ad8\u9636\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7f16\u7801\u591a\u5b9e\u4f53\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8d85\u56fe\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\uff1a\u5c06\u591a\u5b9e\u4f53\u5173\u7cfb\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u8d85\u8fb9\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u7ea61,100\u7bc7\u751f\u7269\u590d\u5408\u6750\u6599\u652f\u67b6\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5168\u5c40\u8d85\u56fe\uff08161,172\u8282\u70b9\uff0c320,201\u8d85\u8fb9\uff09\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u914d\u5907\u8d85\u56fe\u904d\u5386\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8282\u70b9\u4ea4\u96c6\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8d85\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u8d85\u56fe\u5448\u73b0\u65e0\u6807\u5ea6\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5e42\u5f8b\u6307\u6570~1.23\uff09\uff0c\u56f4\u7ed5\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8fde\u901a\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u67a2\u7ebd\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff1b\u8d85\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6210\u5bf9\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7206\u70b8\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u9636\u8def\u5f84\u6865\u63a5\u8bed\u4e49\u9065\u8fdc\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u673a\u5236\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u65b0\u590d\u5408\u6750\u6599\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u5982\u901a\u8fc7\u58f3\u805a\u7cd6\u4e2d\u95f4\u4f53\u5c06\u6c27\u5316\u94c8\u4e0ePCL\u652f\u67b6\u5173\u8054\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65e0\u6559\u5e08\u667a\u80fd\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8d85\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u62a4\u680f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63ed\u793a\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u6240\u906e\u853d\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u3002\u8d85\u56fe\u5f62\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u8868\u8fbe\u590d\u6742\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce a paradigm shift towards subgoal-level evaluation and learning.

This structure reveals a critical divergence between reasoning quality and outcome accuracy. Leveraging this, we propose the Sub-Goal Verifiable Reward (SGVR) framework, which replaces sparse signals with dense rewards based on the Skeleton Rate.

So, we need to quickly find a new safe plan. Replanning only the delayed agent often does not result in an efficient plan, and sometimes cannot even yield a feasible plan. On the other hand, replanning other agents may lead to a cascade of changes and delays. We show how to efficiently replan by tracking and using the temporal flexibility of other agents while avoiding cascading delays. This flexibility is the maximum delay an agent can take without changing the order of or further delaying more agents. Our algorithm, FlexSIPP, precomputes all possible plans for the delayed agent, also returning the changes for the other agents, for any single-agent delay within the given scenario. We demonstrate our method in a real-world case study of replanning trains in the densely-used Dutch railway network.

Leveraging the advantages of MBRL, we incorporate a lookahead strategy for optimal positioning of AGVs, improving operational efficiency. Our approach was evaluated on small-sized public benchmarks and a newly developed large-scale benchmark inspired by the Taillard benchmark. The results show that our approach matches traditional methods on smaller instances and outperforms them on larger ones in terms of makespan while achieving a tenfold reduction in computation time.

We propose sequential noise scheduling, which distributes the noise budget across orthogonal subspaces of the parameter space, rather than injecting it all at once. This simple modification mitigates the destructive effect of noise while preserving the original certification guarantees.

We formalize this problem and introduce \\textbf{DVD} (\\textbf{D}etection via \\textbf{V}ariance of generation \\textbf{D}istribution), a single-sample detector that models the local output distribution induced by temperature sampling. Our key insight is that contaminated items trigger alternation between a \\emph{memory-adherence} state and a \\emph{perturbation-drift} state, yielding abnormally high variance in the synthetic difficulty of low-probability tokens; uncontaminated items remain in drift with comparatively smooth variance. We construct the first benchmark for variant contamination across two domains Omni-MATH and SuperGPQA by generating and filtering semantically equivalent variants, and simulate contamination via fine-tuning models of different scales and architectures (Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1). Across datasets and models, \\textbf{DVD} consistently outperforms perplexity-based, Min-$k$\\%++, edit-distance (CDD), and embedding-similarity baselines, while exhibiting strong robustness to hyperparameters.

However, existing models predominantly focus on short-horizon predictions and suffer from notorious computational costs and memory consumption when scaling to long-horizon predictions and large graphs. Targeting the above challenges, we present FaST, an effective and efficient framework based on heterogeneity-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) for long-horizon and large-scale STG forecasting, which unlocks one-week-ahead (672 steps at a 15-minute granularity) prediction with thousands of nodes. FaST is underpinned by two key innovations. First, an adaptive graph agent attention mechanism is proposed to alleviate the computational burden inherent in conventional graph convolution and self-attention modules when applied to large-scale graphs. Second, we propose a new parallel MoE module that replaces traditional feed-forward networks with Gated Linear Units (GLUs), enabling an efficient and scalable parallel structure. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FaST not only delivers superior long-horizon predictive accuracy but also achieves remarkable computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208 admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models to reweight the JHFRAT scoring weights, while preserving its additive structure and clinical thresholds. Recalibration refers to adjusting item weights so that the resulting score can order encounters more consistently by the study's risk labels, and without changing the tool's form factor or deployment workflow. The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). This performance improvement translates to protecting an additional 35 high-risk patients per week across the Johns Hopkins Health System. The constrained score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression (AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk labeling.

Yet students, especially those with lower self-regulated learning (SRL) competence, often struggle to engage with and interpret analytics feedback. Conversational generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) assistants have shown potential to scaffold this process through real-time, personalised, dialogue-based support. Further advancing this potential, we explored authentic dialogues between students and GenAI assistant integrated into LAD during a 10-week semester. The analysis focused on questions students with different SRL levels posed, the relevance and quality of the assistant's answers, and how students perceived the assistant's role in their learning. Findings revealed distinct query patterns. While low SRL students sought clarification and reassurance, high SRL students queried technical aspects and requested personalised strategies. The assistant provided clear and reliable explanations but limited in personalisation, handling emotionally charged queries, and integrating multiple data points for tailored responses. Findings further extend that GenAI interventions can be especially valuable for low SRL students, offering scaffolding that supports engagement with feedback and narrows gaps with their higher SRL peers. At the same time, students' reflections underscored the importance of trust, need for greater adaptivity, context-awareness, and technical refinement in future systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u4eea\u8868\u677f\uff08LADs\uff09\u4e2d\u5b66\u751f\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u52a9\u624b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0cAI\u52a9\u624b\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u6e05\u6670\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u4f46\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u4eea\u8868\u677f\u867d\u7136\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u53cd\u9988\u652f\u6301\u5b66\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u5b66\u751f\u7279\u522b\u662f\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u5f80\u5f80\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u91ca\u6570\u636e\u53cd\u9988\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u52a9\u624b\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4eea\u8868\u677f\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u652f\u6301\u6765\u4e3a\u5b66\u751f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u652f\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u4e3a\u671f10\u5468\u7684\u5b66\u671f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u5206\u6790\u5b66\u751f\u4e0e\u96c6\u6210\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u4eea\u8868\u677f\u4e2d\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u52a9\u624b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3002\u5206\u6790\u5173\u6ce8\uff1a\u4e0d\u540cSRL\u6c34\u5e73\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u63d0\u95ee\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u52a9\u624b\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5b66\u751f\u5bf9\u52a9\u624b\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540cSRL\u6c34\u5e73\u5b66\u751f\u63d0\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff1a\u4f4eSRL\u5b66\u751f\u5bfb\u6c42\u6f84\u6e05\u548c\u5b89\u6170\uff0c\u9ad8SRL\u5b66\u751f\u8be2\u95ee\u6280\u672f\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002AI\u52a9\u624b\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6e05\u6670\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u91ca\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u5927\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u67e5\u8be2\u5904\u7406\u6709\u9650\u3001\u591a\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u6574\u5408\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5e72\u9884\u5bf9\u4f4eSRL\u5b66\u751f\u7279\u522b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u80fd\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e0e\u9ad8SRL\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u5b66\u751f\u53cd\u9988\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5bf9\u4fe1\u4efb\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u6280\u672f\u7cbe\u70bc\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u52a9\u624b\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9SRL\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u610f\u8bc6\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u7acb\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

The competition required participants to process event camera data to estimate lunar lander trajectories. Despite joining late, we achieved second place with a score of 0.01282, highlighting the potential of human-AI collaboration in competitive scientific settings. ChatGPT contributed not only executable code but also algorithmic reasoning, data handling routines, and methodological suggestions, such as using fixed number of events instead of fixed time spans for windowing. At the same time, we observed limitations: the model often introduced unnecessary structural changes, gets confused by intermediate discussions about alternative ideas, occasionally produced critical errors and forgets important aspects in longer scientific discussions. By analyzing these strengths and shortcomings, we show how conversational AI can both accelerate development and support conceptual insight in scientific research.

We introduce T-Retriever, a novel framework that reformulates attributed graph retrieval as tree-based retrieval using a semantic and structure-guided encoding tree. Our approach features two key innovations: (1) Adaptive Compression Encoding, which replaces artificial compression quotas with a global optimization strategy that preserves the graph's natural hierarchical organization, and (2) Semantic-Structural Entropy ($S^2$-Entropy), which jointly optimizes for both structural cohesion and semantic consistency when creating hierarchical partitions. Experiments across diverse graph reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that T-Retriever significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG methods, providing more coherent and contextually relevant responses to complex queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "T-Retriever\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u6811\u5c06\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u56feRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c42\u6b21\u4fe1\u606f\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5c42\u6b21\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u521a\u6027\u5c42\u7279\u5b9a\u538b\u7f29\u914d\u989d\u635f\u5bb3\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u81ea\u7136\u5c42\u6b21\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faT-Retriever\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1) \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u538b\u7f29\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u53d6\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u538b\u7f29\u914d\u989d\uff1b2) \u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u71b5(S\u00b2-Entropy)\uff0c\u5728\u521b\u5efa\u5c42\u6b21\u5206\u533a\u65f6\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u51dd\u805a\u529b\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5bfc\u7f16\u7801\u6811\u7684\u6811\u57fa\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cT-Retriever\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u52a0\u8fde\u8d2f\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u3002", "conclusion": "T-Retriever\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56fe\u57faRAG\u5728\u5c42\u6b21\u4fe1\u606f\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u52a0\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, this capability often leads to ``overthinking'', where models generate redundant reasoning paths that inflate computational costs without improving accuracy. While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on reasoning traces is a standard paradigm for the 'cold start' phase, applying existing compression techniques to these traces often compromises logical coherence or incurs prohibitive sampling costs. In this paper, we introduce ConMax (Confidence-Maximizing Compression), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to automatically compress reasoning traces while preserving essential reasoning patterns. ConMax formulates compression as a reward-driven optimization problem, training a policy to prune redundancy by maximizing a weighted combination of answer confidence for predictive fidelity and thinking confidence for reasoning validity through a frozen auxiliary LRM. Extensive experiments across five reasoning datasets demonstrate that ConMax achieves a superior efficiency-performance trade-off.

Although notable progress has been achieved on several reasoning benchmarks such as MATH500 and LiveCodeBench, existing benchmarks for algorithmic reasoning remain limited, failing to answer a critical question: Do LRMs truly master algorithmic reasoning? To answer this question, we propose AlgBench, an expert-curated benchmark that evaluates LRMs under an algorithm-centric paradigm.\n  AlgBench consists of over 3,000 original problems spanning 27 algorithms, constructed by ACM algorithmic experts and organized under a comprehensive taxonomy, including Euclidean-structured, non-Euclidean-structured, non-optimized, local-optimized, global-optimized, and heuristic-optimized categories. Empirical evaluations on leading LRMs (e.g., Gemini-3-Pro, DeepSeek-v3.2-Speciale and GPT-o3) reveal substantial performance heterogeneity: while models perform well on non-optimized tasks (up to 92%), accuracy drops sharply to around 49% on globally optimized algorithms such as dynamic programming. Further analysis uncovers \\textbf{strategic over-shifts}, wherein models prematurely abandon correct algorithmic designs due to necessary low-entropy tokens. These findings expose fundamental limitations of problem-centric reinforcement learning and highlight the necessity of an algorithm-centric training paradigm for robust algorithmic reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AlgBench\u8fd9\u4e00\u4e13\u5bb6\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u638c\u63e1\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u8fc7\u8f6c\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u56de\u7b54'\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u638c\u63e1\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406'\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u5728MATH500\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ecd\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u6df1\u5165\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86AlgBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8fc73000\u4e2a\u7531ACM\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e13\u5bb6\u539f\u521b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u9898\u76ee\uff0c\u6db5\u76d627\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u9762\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff08\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u975e\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u3002\u5bf9Gemini-3-Pro\u3001DeepSeek-v3.2-Speciale\u3001GPT-o3\u7b49\u9886\u5148\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff1a\u975e\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe92%\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7b49\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\u81f3\u7ea649%\u3002\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728'\u7b56\u7565\u8fc7\u8f6c\u79fb'\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u7531\u4e8e\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u4f4e\u71b5\u6807\u8bb0\u800c\u63d0\u524d\u653e\u5f03\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u4ee5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002AlgBench\u57fa\u51c6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Our findings reveal that LLMs lack an inherent ability to detect and correct subtle distortions in table representations. Only when provided with an explicit prior, via a system prompt, do models partially adjust their reasoning strategies and correct some distortions, though not consistently or completely. To study this phenomenon, we introduce a small, expert-curated dataset that explicitly evaluates LLMs on table question answering (TQA) tasks requiring an additional error-correction step prior to analysis. Our results reveal systematic differences in how LLMs ingest and interpret tabular information under distortion, with even SoTA models such as GPT-5.2 model exhibiting a drop of minimum 22% accuracy under distortion.

However, most existing methods rely on statically selecting top-k passages based on individual relevance, which fails to exploit combinatorial gains among passages and often introduces substantial redundancy. To address this limitation, we propose OptiSet, a set-centric framework that unifies set selection and set-level ranking for RAG. OptiSet adopts an \"Expand-then-Refine\" paradigm: it first expands a query into multiple perspectives to enable a diverse candidate pool and then refines the candidate pool via re-selection to form a compact evidence set. We then devise a self-synthesis strategy without strong LLM supervision to derive preference labels from the set conditional utility changes of the generator, thereby identifying complementary and redundant evidence.

However, with the paradigm shift towards the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler, we observe that the original theoretical framework and its underlying mechanisms fail to align with new pre-training dynamics. To bridge this gap between theory and practice, this paper derives a revised E(S) relationship tailored for WSD scheduler, characterizing the trade-off between training data consumption E and steps S during pre-training. Our theoretical analysis reveals two fundamental properties of WSD-based pre-training: 1) B_min, the minimum batch size threshold required to achieve a target loss, and 2) B_opt, the optimal batch size that maximizes data efficiency by minimizing total tokens. Building upon these properties, we propose a dynamic Batch Size Scheduler. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our revised formula precisely captures the dynamics of large-scale pre-training, and the resulting scheduling strategy significantly enhances both training efficiency and final model quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Given the stringent trade-off between training costs and model performance, the pivotal question is whether the optimal LR can be accurately extrapolated from low-cost experiments. In this paper, we formalize this investigation into two distinct research paradigms: Fitting and Transfer. Within the Fitting Paradigm, we innovatively introduce a Scaling Law for search factor, effectively reducing the search complexity from O(n^3) to O(n*C_D*C_\u03b7) via predictive modeling. Within the Transfer Paradigm, we extend the principles of $\u03bc$Transfer to the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, broadening its applicability to encompass model depth, weight decay, and token horizons. By pushing the boundaries of existing hyperparameter research in terms of scale, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between these two paradigms. Our empirical results challenge the scalability of the widely adopted $\u03bc$ Transfer in large-scale pre-training scenarios. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous analysis through the dual lenses of training stability and feature learning to elucidate the underlying reasons why module-wise parameter tuning underperforms in large-scale settings.

But it remains unclear whether this persuasive power advantages truth over falsehood, or if LLMs can promote misbeliefs just as easily as refuting them. Here, we investigate this question across three pre-registered experiments in which participants (N = 2,724 Americans) discussed a conspiracy theory they were uncertain about with GPT-4o, and the model was instructed to either argue against (\"debunking\") or for (\"bunking\") that conspiracy. When using a \"jailbroken\" GPT-4o variant with guardrails removed, the AI was as effective at increasing conspiracy belief as decreasing it. Concerningly, the bunking AI was rated more positively, and increased trust in AI, more than the debunking AI. Surprisingly, we found that using standard GPT-4o produced very similar effects, such that the guardrails imposed by OpenAI did little to revent the LLM from promoting conspiracy beliefs. Encouragingly, however, a corrective conversation reversed these newly induced conspiracy beliefs, and simply prompting GPT-4o to only use accurate information dramatically reduced its ability to increase conspiracy beliefs. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs possess potent abilities to promote both truth and falsehood, but that potential solutions may exist to help mitigate this risk.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based extensions improve upon vanilla RLVR (e.g., GRPO) by providing tree-based reasoning rollouts that enable fine-grained and segment-level credit assignment. However, existing methods still suffer from limited exploration diversity and inefficient reasoning. To address the above challenges, we propose reinforced efficient reasoning via semantically diverse explorations, i.e., ROSE, for LLMs. To encourage more diverse reasoning exploration, our method incorporates a semantic-entropy-based branching strategy and an $\\varepsilon$-exploration mechanism. The former operates on already sampled reasoning rollouts to capture semantic uncertainty and select branching points with high semantic divergence to generate new successive reasoning paths, whereas the latter stochastically initiates reasoning rollouts from the root, preventing the search process from becoming overly local. To improve efficiency, we design a length-aware segment-level advantage estimator that rewards concise and correct reasoning while penalizing unnecessarily long reasoning chains. Extensive experiments on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Qwen and Llama models validate the effectiveness and efficiency of ROSE.

We study how to induce privacy-first reasoning, where models reason without exposing sensitive information, using deployable interventions rather than post-hoc redaction. We introduce PII-CoT-Bench, a supervised dataset with privacy-aware CoT annotations, and a category-balanced evaluation benchmark covering realistic and adversarial leakage scenarios. Our results reveal a capability-dependent trend: state-of-the-art models benefit most from prompt-based controls, whereas weaker models require fine-tuning to achieve meaningful leakage reduction. Across models and categories, both approaches substantially reduce PII exposure with minimal degradation in utility, demonstrating that private reasoning can be achieved without sacrificing performance. Overall, we show that private CoT reasoning can be achieved with minimal utility loss, providing practical guidance for building privacy-preserving reasoning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While the development of Arabic-native LLMs is accelerating, the benchmarks for evaluating their capabilities lag behind, with most existing frameworks focusing on English. A critical and overlooked area is tool-calling, where the performance of models prompted in non-English languages like Arabic is poorly understood, especially since these models are often pretrained on predominantly English data. This paper addresses this critical gap by introducing the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating the tool-calling and agentic capabilities of LLMs in the Arabic language. Our work provides a standardized framework to measure the functional accuracy and robustness of models in Arabic agentic workflows. Our findings reveal a huge performance gap: when users interact in Arabic, tool-calling accuracy drops by an average of 5-10\\%, regardless of whether the tool descriptions themselves are in Arabic or English.

However, achieving strong performance across these domains with a single general-purpose model typically requires scaling to sizes that are prohibitively expensive to train and deploy. On the other hand, while smaller domain-specialized models are much more efficient, they struggle to generalize beyond their training distributions. To address this dilemma, we propose FusionRoute, a robust and effective token-level multi-LLM collaboration framework in which a lightweight router simultaneously (i) selects the most suitable expert at each decoding step and (ii) contributes a complementary logit that refines or corrects the selected expert's next-token distribution via logit addition. Unlike existing token-level collaboration methods that rely solely on fixed expert outputs, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that pure expert-only routing is fundamentally limited: unless strong global coverage assumptions hold, it cannot in general realize the optimal decoding policy. By augmenting expert selection with a trainable complementary generator, FusionRoute expands the effective policy class and enables recovery of optimal value functions under mild conditions. Empirically, across both Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families and diverse benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, and instruction following, FusionRoute outperforms both sequence- and token-level collaboration, model merging, and direct fine-tuning, while remaining competitive with domain experts on their respective tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, most existing systems adopt an ``all-or-nothing'' approach to memory usage: incorporating all relevant past information can lead to \\textit{Memory Anchoring}, where the agent is trapped by past interactions, while excluding memory entirely results in under-utilization and the loss of important interaction history. We show that an agent's reliance on memory can be modeled as an explicit and user-controllable dimension.

Collaborative inference offers a promising solution by selectively allocating work between lightweight and large models, yet a fundamental challenge remains: determining when a reasoning step requires the capacity of a large model or the efficiency of a small model. Existing routing strategies either rely on local token probabilities or post-hoc verification, introducing significant inference overhead. In this work, we propose a novel perspective on step-wise collaboration: the difficulty of a reasoning step can be inferred from its very first token. Inspired by the \"Aha Moment\" phenomenon in LRMs, we show that the entropy of the initial token serves as a strong predictor of step difficulty. Building on this insight, we introduce GlimpRouter, a training-free step-wise collaboration framework. GlimpRouter employs a lightweight model to generate only the first token of each reasoning step and routes the step to a larger model only when the initial token entropy exceeds a threshold. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces inference latency while preserving accuracy. For instance, GlimpRouter attains a substantial 10.7% improvement in accuracy while reducing inference latency by 25.9% compared to a standalone large model on AIME25. These results suggest a simple yet effective mechanism for reasoning: allocating computation based on a glimpse of thought rather than full-step evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We find the opposite: judges are consistent, but not with each other; they are consistent with themselves. Across 3,240 evaluations (9 judges x 120 unique video x pack items x 3 independent runs), inter-judge agreement is near-zero (Krippendorff's \u03b1 = 0.042). On two dimensions, judges disagree more than random noise would predict (\u03b1 < 0). Yet this disagreement isn't chaos; it's structured. A classifier identifies which judge produced an evaluation with 77.1% accuracy from rubric scores alone, rising to 89.9% with disposition features. Within model families, the signal is even stronger: GPT-4.1 and GPT-5.2 are distinguishable with 99.6% accuracy. We call this the reliability paradox: judges cannot agree on what constitutes quality, yet their disagreement patterns are so stable they function as fingerprints. Each judge implements a distinct, stable theory of quality: an \"evaluative disposition\" that shapes how it interprets any rubric. We characterize these dispositions along multiple axes: harshness/leniency, dimension emphasis, within-judge stability (ICC), and evidence behavior (receipt validity, semantic linkage via NLI, and shotgun index). The implication is stark: LLM judges are not interchangeable instruments measuring a shared construct. They are distinct measurement devices, each encoding its own implicit theory of quality.

Token-based watermarking techniques can corrupt the reasoning flow by applying pseudo-random biases, while semantic-aware approaches improve quality but introduce significant latency or require auxiliary models. This paper introduces ReasonMark, a novel watermarking framework specifically designed for reasoning-intensive LLMs. Our approach decouples generation into an undisturbed Thinking Phase and a watermarked Answering Phase. We propose a Criticality Score to identify semantically pivotal tokens from the reasoning trace, which are distilled into a Principal Semantic Vector (PSV). The PSV then guides a semantically-adaptive mechanism that modulates watermark strength based on token-PSV alignment, ensuring robustness without compromising logical integrity. Extensive experiments show ReasonMark surpasses state-of-the-art methods by reducing text Perplexity by 0.35, increasing translation BLEU score by 0.164, and raising mathematical accuracy by 0.67 points. These advancements are achieved alongside a 0.34% higher watermark detection AUC and stronger robustness to attacks, all with a negligible increase in latency.

However, this creates a self-consuming retraining loop, where models are trained on their own outputs and may cause performance drops and induce emerging biases. In real-world applications, previously deployed LLMs may influence the data they generate, leading to a dynamic system driven by user feedback. For example, if a model continues to underserve users from a group, less query data will be collected from this particular demographic of users. In this study, we introduce the concept of \\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{C}onsuming \\textbf{P}erformative \\textbf{L}oop (\\textbf{SCPL}) and investigate the role of synthetic data in shaping bias during these dynamic iterative training processes under controlled performative feedback. This controlled setting is motivated by the inaccessibility of real-world user preference data from dynamic production systems, and enables us to isolate and analyze feedback-driven bias evolution in a principled manner.

We introduce SimuAgent, an LLM-powered modeling and simulation agent tailored for Simulink. SimuAgent replaces verbose XML with a concise, dictionary-style Python representation, dramatically cutting token counts, improving interpretability, and enabling fast, in-process simulation. A lightweight plan-execute architecture, trained in two stages, equips the agent with both low-level tool skills and high-level design reasoning. To tackle sparse rewards in long-horizon tasks, we propose Reflection-GRPO (ReGRPO), which augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with self-reflection traces that supply rich intermediate feedback, accelerating convergence and boosting robustness. Experiments on SimuBench, our newly released benchmark comprising 5300 multi-domain modeling tasks, show that a Qwen2.5-7B model fine-tuned with SimuAgent converges faster and achieves higher modeling accuracy than standard RL baselines, and even surpasses GPT-4o when evaluated with few-shot prompting on the same benchmark. Ablations confirm that the two-stage curriculum and abstract-reconstruct data augmentation further enhance generalization. SimuAgent trains and runs entirely on-premise with modest hardware, delivering a privacy-preserving, cost-effective solution for industrial model-driven engineering. SimuAgent bridges the gap between LLMs and graphical modeling environments, offering a practical solution for AI-assisted engineering design in industrial settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While world models possess this capability, they most often require action labels, that can be complex to obtain at scale. This motivates the learning of latent action models, that can learn an action space from videos alone. Our work addresses the problem of learning latent actions world models on in-the-wild videos, expanding the scope of existing works that focus on simple robotics simulations, video games, or manipulation data. While this allows us to capture richer actions, it also introduces challenges stemming from the video diversity, such as environmental noise, or the lack of a common embodiment across videos. To address some of the challenges, we discuss properties that actions should follow as well as relevant architectural choices and evaluations. We find that continuous, but constrained, latent actions are able to capture the complexity of actions from in-the-wild videos, something that the common vector quantization does not. We for example find that changes in the environment coming from agents, such as humans entering the room, can be transferred across videos. This highlights the capability of learning actions that are specific to in-the-wild videos. In the absence of a common embodiment across videos, we are mainly able to learn latent actions that become localized in space, relative to the camera. Nonetheless, we are able to train a controller that maps known actions to latent ones, allowing us to use latent actions as a universal interface and solve planning tasks with our world model with similar performance as action-conditioned baselines. Our analyses and experiments provide a step towards scaling latent action models to the real world.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
