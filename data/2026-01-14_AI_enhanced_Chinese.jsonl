This study presents a hybrid explainable AI (XAI) framework combining ante-hoc fuzzy logic with post-hoc SHAP explanations, validated through systematic clinician feedback. We developed a fuzzy-XGBoost model on 1,014 maternal health records, achieving 88.67% accuracy (ROC-AUC: 0.9703). A validation study with 14 healthcare professionals in Bangladesh revealed strong preference for hybrid explanations (71.4% across three clinical cases) with 54.8% expressing trust for clinical use. SHAP analysis identified healthcare access as the primary predictor, with the engineered fuzzy risk score ranking third, validating clinical knowledge integration (r=0.298). Clinicians valued integrated clinical parameters but identified critical gaps: obstetric history, gestational age, and connectivity barriers. This work demonstrates that combining interpretable fuzzy rules with feature importance explanations enhances both utility and trust, providing practical insights for XAI deployment in maternal healthcare.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The first question is how to enable a model to recognize that it does not know. A promising approach is to use confidence, computed from the model's internal signals, to reflect its ignorance. Prior work in specific domains has shown that calibration can provide reliable confidence estimates. In this work, we propose a simple, effective, and universal training-free method that applies to both vision and language models, performing model calibration, cascading, and data cleaning to better exploit a model's ability to recognize when it does not know. We first highlight two key empirical observations: higher confidence corresponds to higher accuracy within a single model, and models calibrated on the validation set remain calibrated on a held-out test set. These findings empirically establish the reliability and comparability of calibrated confidence. Building on this, we introduce two applications: (1) model cascading with calibrated advantage routing and (2) data cleaning based on model ensemble. Using the routing signal derived from the comparability of calibrated confidences, we cascade large and small models to improve efficiency with almost no compromise in accuracy, and we further cascade two models of comparable scale to achieve performance beyond either model alone. Leveraging multiple experts and their calibrated confidences, we design a simple yet effective data-cleaning method that balances precision and detection rate to identify mislabeled samples in ImageNet and Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) datasets. Our results demonstrate that enabling models to recognize when they do not know is a practical step toward more efficient, reliable, and trustworthy AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent CPU architectures integrate specialized Matrix Processing Units (MPUs) that efficiently support matrix outer-product operations, offering new opportunities to overcome this limitation. Leveraging this architectural shift, this work focuses on redesigning the current deposition step of PIC simulations under a matrix-centric execution model.\n  We present MatrixPIC, the first holistic co-design of the deposition kernel, data layout, and incremental particle sorting tailored to the hybrid MPU--VPU SIMD model on modern CPUs. MatrixPIC introduces: (i)~a block-matrix formulation of the current deposition algorithm that maps naturally to MPU outer-product primitives; (ii)~a hybrid execution pipeline that combines MPU-based high-density accumulation with VPU-based data preparation and control flow; and (iii)~an $O(1)$-amortized incremental sorter based on a gapped packed-memory array to preserve data locality for efficient MPU execution.\n  Evaluated on a next-generation HPC platform, MatrixPIC achieves significant performance gains. In Laser-Wakefield Acceleration (LWFA) simulations, it delivers up to $2.63\\times$ speedup in total runtime. For third-order deposition, the core kernel is accelerated by $8.7\\times$ over the baseline and $2.0\\times$ over the best hand-optimized VPU implementation. Moreover, MatrixPIC reaches $83.08\\%$ of theoretical CPU peak performance, nearly $2.8\\times$ higher than a highly optimized CUDA kernel on a data center GPU.

A CDB differs from a traditional DB: it is designed to answer \"why'' questions via causal interventions and structured causal queries. CSQL builds on our earlier system, DEMOCRITUS, which converts documents into thousands of local causal models derived from causal discourse. Unlike RAG-based systems or knowledge-graph based approaches, CSQL supports causal analysis over document collections rather than purely associative retrieval. For example, given an article on the origins of human bipedal walking, CSQL enables queries such as: \"What are the strongest causal influences on bipedalism?'' or \"Which variables act as causal hubs with the largest downstream influence?'' Beyond single-document case studies, we show that CSQL can also ingest RAG/IE-compiled causal corpora at scale by compiling the Testing Causal Claims (TCC) dataset of economics papers into a causal database containing 265,656 claim instances spanning 45,319 papers, 44 years, and 1,575 reported method strings, thereby enabling corpus-level causal queries and longitudinal analyses in CSQL.

While OpenAI introduces deliberative alignment (DA) to enhance the safety of its o-series models through reasoning over detailed ``code-like'' safety rules, the effectiveness of this approach in open-source LLMs, which typically lack advanced reasoning capabilities, is understudied. In this work, we systematically evaluate the impact of explicitly specifying extensive safety codes versus demonstrating them through illustrative cases. We find that referencing explicit codes inconsistently improves harmlessness and systematically degrades helpfulness, whereas training on case-augmented simple codes yields more robust and generalized safety behaviors. By guiding LLMs with case-augmented reasoning instead of extensive code-like safety rules, we avoid rigid adherence to narrowly enumerated rules and enable broader adaptability. Building on these insights, we propose CADA, a case-augmented deliberative alignment method for LLMs utilizing reinforcement learning on self-generated safety reasoning chains. CADA effectively enhances harmlessness, improves robustness against attacks, and reduces over-refusal while preserving utility across diverse benchmarks, offering a practical alternative to rule-only DA for improving safety while maintaining helpfulness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u660e\u786e\u8be6\u5c3d\u5b89\u5168\u89c4\u5219\u4e0e\u6848\u4f8b\u589e\u5f3a\u7b80\u5355\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u540e\u8005\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6848\u4f8b\u589e\u5f3a\u5ba1\u614e\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5CADA\u3002", "motivation": "\u786e\u4fdd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9075\u5b88\u5b89\u5168\u539f\u5219\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u5bf9\u826f\u6027\u8bf7\u6c42\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62d2\u7edd\u662f\u4e00\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5ba1\u614e\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8be6\u7ec6\u5b89\u5168\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u65e0\u5bb3\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u660e\u786e\u8be6\u5c3d\u5b89\u5168\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u6848\u4f8b\u589e\u5f3a\u7b80\u5355\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u6548\u679c\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51faCADA\uff08\u6848\u4f8b\u589e\u5f3a\u5ba1\u614e\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u66ff\u4ee3\u7eaf\u89c4\u5219\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b3. \u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "result": "1. \u660e\u786e\u8be6\u5c3d\u5b89\u5168\u89c4\u5219\u4ec5\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u5bb3\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u964d\u4f4e\u6709\u7528\u6027\uff1b2. \u6848\u4f8b\u589e\u5f3a\u7b80\u5355\u89c4\u5219\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b3.

However, existing implementations fail to fully exploit the special structure of modern CPU architectures and tensor-product elements, causing their performance \"sweet spot\" to anomalously remain at the low order of $p \\approx 2$, which severely limits the potential of high-order methods. To address this challenge, we design and implement a highly optimized PA operator within the MFEM framework, deeply integrated with a Geometric Multigrid (GMG) preconditioner. Our multi-level optimization strategy includes replacing the original $O(p^6)$ generic algorithm with an efficient $O(p^4)$ one based on tensor factorization, exploiting Voigt symmetry to reduce redundant computations for the elasticity problem, and employing macro-kernel fusion to enhance data locality and break the memory bandwidth bottleneck. Extensive experiments on mainstream x86 and ARM architectures demonstrate that our method successfully shifts the performance \"sweet spot\" to the higher-order region of $p \\ge 6$. Compared to the MFEM baseline, the optimized core operator (kernel) achieves speedups of 7x to 83x, which translates to a 3.6x to 16.8x end-to-end performance improvement in the complete solution process.

With the rapid growth of vector data, efficient indexing for real-time vector search has become rudimentary. Existing CPU-based solutions support updates but suffer from low throughput, while GPU-accelerated systems deliver high performance but face challenges with dynamic updates and limited GPU memory, resulting in a critical performance gap for continuous, large-scale vector search requiring both accuracy and speed. In this paper, we present SVFusion, a GPU-CPU-disk collaborative framework for real-time vector search that bridges sophisticated GPU computation with online updates. SVFusion leverages a hierarchical vector index architecture that employs CPU-GPU co-processing, along with a workload-aware vector caching mechanism to maximize the efficiency of limited GPU memory. It further enhances performance through real-time coordination with CUDA multi-stream optimization and adaptive resource management, along with concurrency control that ensures data consistency under interleaved queries and updates. Empirical results demonstrate that SVFusion achieves significant improvements in query latency and throughput, exhibiting a 20.9x higher throughput on average and 1.3x to 50.7x lower latency compared to baseline methods, while maintaining high recall for large-scale datasets under various streaming workloads.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Code available at https://github.com/Govcraft/latin-experiment", "summary": "Current multi-agent LLM frameworks rely on explicit orchestration patterns borrowed from human organizational structures: planners delegate to executors, managers coordinate workers, and hierarchical control flow governs agent interactions. These approaches suffer from coordination overhead that scales poorly with agent count and task complexity. We propose a fundamentally different paradigm inspired by natural coordination mechanisms: agents operate locally on a shared artifact, guided only by pressure gradients derived from measurable quality signals, with temporal decay preventing premature convergence. We formalize this as optimization over a pressure landscape and prove convergence guarantees under mild conditions.\n  Empirically, on Latin Square constraint satisfaction across 1,078 trials, pressure-field coordination matches hierarchical control (38.2% vs 38.8% aggregate solve rate, p=0.94, indicating statistical equivalence). Both significantly outperform sequential (23.3%), random (11.7%), and conversation-based multi-agent dialogue (8.6%, p<0.00001). Temporal decay is essential: disabling it increases final pressure 49-fold (d=4.15). On easy problems, pressure-field achieves 87% solve rate.

However, high-stakes applications can occur internally when companies deploy highly capable systems within their own organizations, such as for automating R\\&D, accelerating critical business processes, and handling sensitive proprietary data. This paper examines how frontier AI regulations in the United States and European Union in 2025 handle internal deployment. We identify three gaps that could cause internally-deployed systems to evade intended oversight: (1) scope ambiguity that allows internal systems to evade regulatory obligations, (2) point-in-time compliance assessments that fail to capture the continuous evolution of internal systems, and (3) information asymmetries that subvert regulatory awareness and oversight. We then analyze why these gaps persist, examining tensions around measurability, incentives, and information access. Finally, we map potential approaches to address them and their associated tradeoffs. By understanding these patterns, we hope that policy choices around internally deployed AI systems can be made deliberately rather than incidentally.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, due to memory constraints, MoE models with billions or even trillions of parameters can only be deployed in multi-GPU or even multi-node & multi-GPU based serving systems. Thus, communication has became a major bottleneck in distributed serving systems, especially inter-node communication. Contemporary distributed MoE models are primarily implemented using all-reduce (AR) based tensor parallelism (TP) and all-to-all (A2A) based expert parallelism (EP). However, TP generally exhibits low inter-node efficiency and is thus confined to high-speed intra-node bandwidth. In contrast, EP tends to suffer from load imbalance, especially when the parallel degree is high.\n  In this work, we introduce MixServe, a novel automatic distributed serving system for efficient deployment of MoE models by a novel TP-EP hybrid parallelism based on fused AR-A2A communication algorithm. MixServe begins by evaluating the communication overhead associated with various parallel strategies, taking into account the model hyperparameters and the configurations of network and hardware resources, and then automatically selects the most efficient parallel strategy. Then, we propose the TP-EP hybrid parallelism based on fused AR-A2A communication algorithm that overlaps intra-node AR communication and inter-node A2A communication. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3 models demonstrate that MixServe achieves superior inference performance, with 1.08~3.80x acceleration in time to first token (TTFT), 1.03~1.66x acceleration in inter-token latency (ITL), and 5.2%~50.3% throughput improvement compared to existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To compare these techniques and select the best one for deployment, the community depends on public benchmarks and their leaderboards. Since these benchmarks heavily rely on human annotations during question construction and answer evaluation, the validity of the annotations is crucial.\n  In this paper, we conduct an empirical study that (i) benchmarks annotation error rates for two widely used text-to-SQL benchmarks, BIRD and Spider 2.0-Snow, and (ii) corrects a subset of the BIRD development (Dev) set to measure the impact of annotation errors on text-to-SQL agent performance and leaderboard rankings. Through expert analysis, we show that BIRD Mini-Dev and Spider 2.0-Snow have error rates of 52.8% and 62.8%, respectively. We re-evaluate all 16 open-source agents from the BIRD leaderboard on both the original and the corrected BIRD Dev subsets. We show that performance changes range from -7% to 31% (in relative terms) and rank changes range from $-9$ to $+9$ positions. We further assess whether these impacts generalize to the full BIRD Dev set. We find that the rankings of agents on the uncorrected subset correlate strongly with those on the full Dev set (Spearman's $r_s$=0.85, $p$=3.26e-5), whereas they correlate weakly with those on the corrected subset (Spearman's $r_s$=0.32, $p$=0.23).

Current approaches to mitigate these risks, such as model-based safeguards, enhance agents' reliability but cannot guarantee system safety. Methods like information flow control (IFC) and temporal constraints aim to provide guarantees but often require extensive human annotation. We propose a process that starts with applying System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) to identify hazards in agent workflows, derive safety requirements, and formalize them as enforceable specifications on data flows and tool sequences. To enable this, we introduce a capability-enhanced Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework that requires structured labels on capabilities, confidentiality, and trust level.

Code can be found at: https://github.com/glam-imperial/AffectEffect", "summary": "Generalisation to unseen subjects in EEG-based emotion classification remains a challenge due to high inter-and intra-subject variability. Continual learning (CL) poses a promising solution by learning from a sequence of tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Regularisation-based CL approaches, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Synaptic Intelligence (SI), and Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), are commonly used as baselines in EEG-based CL studies, yet their suitability for this problem remains underexplored. This study theoretically and empirically finds that regularisation-based CL methods show limited performance for EEG-based emotion classification on the DREAMER and SEED datasets. We identify a fundamental misalignment in the stability-plasticity trade-off, where regularisation-based methods prioritise mitigating catastrophic forgetting (backward transfer) over adapting to new subjects (forward transfer). We investigate this limitation under subject-incremental sequences and observe that: (1) the heuristics for estimating parameter importance become less reliable under noisy data and covariate shift, (2) gradients on parameters deemed important by these heuristics often interfere with gradient updates required for new subjects, moving optimisation away from the minimum, (3) importance values accumulated across tasks over-constrain the model, and (4) performance is sensitive to subject order.

This limits instructors' ability to identify disengagement and adapt teaching strategies in real time. This paper presents SCASED (Smart Classroom Attendance System with Emotion Detection), an IoT-based system that integrates automated attendance tracking with facial emotion recognition to support classroom engagement monitoring. The system uses a Raspberry Pi camera and OpenCV for face detection, and a finetuned MobileNetV2 model to classify four learning-related emotional states: engagement, boredom, confusion, and frustration. A session-based mechanism is implemented to manage attendance and emotion monitoring by recording attendance once per session and performing continuous emotion analysis thereafter. Attendance and emotion data are visualized through a cloud-based dashboard to provide instructors with insights into classroom dynamics. Experimental evaluation using the DAiSEE dataset achieved an emotion classification accuracy of 89.5%. The results show that integrating attendance data with emotion analytics can provide instructors with additional insight into classroom dynamics and support more responsive teaching practices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, it is known that many official API documents are obsolete and incomplete. To address this challenge, we propose a new approach called AutoDoc that generates API documents with API knowledge extracted from online discussions on Stack Overflow (SO). AutoDoc leverages a fine-tuned dense retrieval model to identify seven types of API knowledge from SO posts. Then, it uses GPT-4o to summarize the API knowledge in these posts into concise text. Meanwhile, we designed two specific components to handle LLM hallucination and redundancy in generated content. We evaluated AutoDoc against five comparison baselines on 48 APIs of different popularity levels. Our results indicate that the API documents generated by AutoDoc are up to 77.7% more accurate, 9.5% less duplicated, and contain 34.4% knowledge uncovered by the official documents. We also measured the sensitivity of AutoDoc to the choice of different LLMs. We found that while larger LLMs produce higher-quality API documents, AutoDoc enables smaller open-source models (e.g., Mistral-7B-v0.3) to achieve comparable results. Finally, we conducted a user study to evaluate the usefulness of the API documents generated by AutoDoc. All participants found API documents generated by AutoDoc to be more comprehensive, concise, and helpful than the comparison baselines. This highlights the feasibility of utilizing LLMs for API documentation with careful design to counter LLM hallucination and information redundancy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

An Agent Contract unifies input/output specifications, multi-dimensional resource constraints, temporal boundaries, and success criteria into a coherent governance mechanism with explicit lifecycle semantics. For multi-agent coordination, we establish conservation laws ensuring delegated budgets respect parent constraints, enabling hierarchical coordination through contract delegation. Empirical validation across four experiments demonstrates 90% token reduction with 525x lower variance in iterative workflows, zero conservation violations in multi-agent delegation, and measurable quality-resource tradeoffs through contract modes.

We propose RewriteNets, a novel neural architecture built on an alternative paradigm: explicit, parallel string rewriting. Each layer in a RewriteNet contains a set of learnable rules. For each position in an input sequence, the layer performs four operations: (1) fuzzy matching of rule patterns, (2) conflict resolution via a differentiable assignment operator to select non-overlapping rewrites, (3) application of the chosen rules to replace input segments with output segments of potentially different lengths, and (4) propagation of untouched tokens. While the discrete assignment of rules is non-differentiable, we employ a straight-through Gumbel-Sinkhorn estimator, enabling stable end-to-end training. We evaluate RewriteNets on algorithmic, compositional, and string manipulation tasks, comparing them against strong LSTM and Transformer baselines. Results show that RewriteNets excel at tasks requiring systematic generalization (achieving 98.7% accuracy on the SCAN benchmark's length split) and are computationally more efficient than Transformers. We also provide an analysis of learned rules and an extensive ablation study, demonstrating that this architecture presents a promising direction for sequence modeling with explicit structural inductive biases.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

With increasing renewable energy integration, sustainable energy management has become essential for reducing grid dependence and supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 on affordable and clean energy. However, the intermittent nature of renewables poses challenges in balancing supply and demand in real time. Intelligent load scheduling is therefore crucial to minimize operational costs while maintaining reliability. Reinforcement Learning has shown promise in improving energy efficiency and reducing costs. However, most RL-based scheduling methods assume complete knowledge of future prices or generation, which is unrealistic in dynamic environments. Moreover, standard PPO variants rely on fixed clipping or KL divergence thresholds, often leading to unstable training under variable tariffs. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for efficient load scheduling in dairy farms, focusing on battery storage and water heating under realistic operational constraints. The proposed Forecast Aware PPO incorporates short term forecasts of demand and renewable generation using hour of day and month based residual calibration, while the PID KL PPO variant employs a proportional integral derivative controller to regulate KL divergence for stable policy updates adaptively. Trained on real world dairy farm data, the method achieves up to 1% lower electricity cost than PPO, 4.8% than DQN, and 1.5% than SAC. For battery scheduling, PPO reduces grid imports by 13.1%, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness for sustainable energy management in modern dairy farming.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e73\u4e1a\u519c\u573a\u8d1f\u8377\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2aPPO\u53d8\u4f53\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\u7684Forecast Aware PPO\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7PID\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282KL\u6563\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e73\u4e1a\u519c\u573a\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u7535\u7f51\u4f9b\u7535\uff0c\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u7684\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u4f7f\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f9b\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709RL\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u672a\u6765\u7535\u4ef7\u6216\u53d1\u7535\u91cf\u5df2\u77e5\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\uff1b\u4f20\u7edfPPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u5728\u7535\u4ef7\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8d1f\u8377\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u4f18\u5316\u7535\u6c60\u50a8\u80fd\u548c\u70ed\u6c34\u8d1f\u8377\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6539\u8fdbPPO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1aForecast Aware PPO\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u65f6\u548c\u6708\u5ea6\u6b8b\u5dee\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u9884\u6d4b\uff1bPID KL PPO\u91c7\u7528PID\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282KL\u6563\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e73\u4e1a\u519c\u573a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4PPO\u964d\u4f4e1%\u7535\u8d39\uff0c\u6bd4DQN\u4f4e4.8%\uff0c\u6bd4SAC\u4f4e1.5%\u3002\u5728\u7535\u6c60\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\uff0cPPO\u51cf\u5c11\u7535\u7f51\u8f93\u516513.1%\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u4e73\u4e1a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u80fd\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e73\u4e1a\u519c\u573a\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u7535\u7f51\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4e3a\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u96c6\u6210\u4e0b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u8d1f\u8377\u8c03\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u68077\uff08\u53ef\u8d1f\u62c5\u6e05\u6d01\u80fd\u6e90\uff09\u3002"}}

This shift opens a pathway for new cognitive challenges that amplify existing decision-making biases or create entirely novel ones. One such type of challenge stems from cognitive biases, which are thinking patterns that lead people away from logical reasoning and result in sub-optimal decisions. How do cognitive biases manifest and impact decision-making in emerging AI-collaborative development? This paper presents the first comprehensive study of cognitive biases in LLM-assisted development. We employ a mixed-methods approach, combining observational studies with 14 student and professional developers, followed by surveys with 22 additional developers. We qualitatively compare categories of biases affecting developers against the traditional non-LLM workflows. Our findings suggest that LLM-related actions are more likely to be associated with novel biases. Through a systematic analysis of 90 cognitive biases specific to developer-LLM interactions, we develop a taxonomy of 15 bias categories validated by cognitive psychologists. We found that 48.8% of total programmer actions are biased, and developer-LLM interactions account for 56.4% of these biased actions. We discuss how these bias categories manifest, present tools and practices for developers, and recommendations for LLM tool builders to help mitigate cognitive biases in human-AI programming.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86LLM\u534f\u52a9\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u7f16\u7a0b\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e2d\u7ea648.8%\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d56.4%\u6d89\u53ca\u5f00\u53d1\u8005-LLM\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa15\u7c7b\u65b0\u578b\u504f\u89c1\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7f13\u89e3\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7f16\u7a0b\u6d3b\u52a8\u6b63\u4ece\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u751f\u6210\u8f6c\u5411\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u8f6c\u53d8\u53ef\u80fd\u653e\u5927\u6216\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u5b66\u754c\u5c1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9AI\u534f\u4f5c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u504f\u89c1\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5148\u5bf914\u540d\u5b66\u751f\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u89c2\u5bdf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u518d\u5bf922\u540d\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u95ee\u5377\u8c03\u67e5\uff1b\u5b9a\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u975eLLM\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e0eLLM\u534f\u52a9\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u679090\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u8005-LLM\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7ecf\u8ba4\u77e5\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u768415\u7c7b\u504f\u89c1\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff0948.8%\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u884c\u4e3a\u5b58\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\uff1b2\uff09\u5176\u4e2d56.4%\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u884c\u4e3a\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u8005-LLM\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff1b3\uff09LLM\u76f8\u5173\u884c\u4e3a\u66f4\u6613\u5f15\u53d1\u65b0\u578b\u504f\u89c1\uff1b4\uff09\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5305\u542b15\u4e2a\u504f\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u504f\u89c1\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b-AI\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u534f\u52a9\u5f00\u53d1\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u504f\u89c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u548cLLM\u5de5\u5177\u6784\u5efa\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u5b9e\u8df5\u5efa\u8bae\u53ca\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u7c7b-AI\u534f\u4f5c\u7f16\u7a0b\u8d28\u91cf\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Clients request content through ANs acting as gateways, without observing AN states or the actions of other clients. We define the reward as the age of information reduction resulting from a client's selection of an AN, and formulate the problem as a non-stationary multi-armed bandit. In this decentralized and partially observable setting, the resulting reward process is history-dependent and coupled across clients, and exhibits both abrupt and gradual changes in expected rewards, rendering classical bandit-based approaches ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose the AGING BANDIT WITH ADAPTIVE RESET algorithm, which combines adaptive windowing with periodic monitoring to track evolving reward distributions.

Roads are finally prioritized based on geometric complexity, driving difficulty, and historical failures, ensuring that the most critical and challenging tests are executed first. We evaluate our framework on the OPENCAT dataset and the Udacity self-driving car simulator using two ADAS models.

The prevailing editing paradigm, which appends an update matrix to the original parameter matrix, has been shown by some studies to damage key numerical stability indicators (such as condition number and norm), thereby reducing editing performance and general abilities, especially in sequential editing scenario. Although subsequent methods have made some improvements, they remain within the additive framework and have not fundamentally addressed this limitation. To solve this problem, we analyze it from both statistical and mathematical perspectives and conclude that multiplying the original matrix by an orthogonal matrix does not change the numerical stability of the matrix. Inspired by this, different from the previous additive editing paradigm, a multiplicative editing paradigm termed Multiplicative Orthogonal Sequential Editing (MOSE) is proposed. Specifically, we first derive the matrix update in the multiplicative form, the new knowledge is then incorporated into an orthogonal matrix, which is multiplied by the original parameter matrix. In this way, the numerical stability of the edited matrix is unchanged, thereby maintaining editing performance and general abilities. We compared MOSE with several current knowledge editing methods, systematically evaluating their impact on both editing performance and the general abilities across three different LLMs. Experimental results show that MOSE effectively limits deviations in the edited parameter matrix and maintains its numerical stability. Compared to current methods, MOSE achieves a 12.08% improvement in sequential editing performance, while retaining 95.73% of general abilities across downstream tasks.

Code: https://github.com/gut-puncture", "summary": "Negative constraints (instructions of the form \"do not use word X\") represent a fundamental test of instruction-following capability in large language models. Despite their apparent simplicity, these constraints fail with striking regularity, and the conditions governing failure have remained poorly understood. This paper presents the first comprehensive mechanistic investigation of negative instruction failure. We introduce semantic pressure, a quantitative measure of the model's intrinsic probability of generating the forbidden token, and demonstrate that violation probability follows a tight logistic relationship with pressure ($p=\u03c3(-2.40+2.27\\cdot P_0)$; $n=40{,}000$ samples; bootstrap $95%$ CI for slope: $[2.21,,2.33]$). Through layer-wise analysis using the logit lens technique, we establish that the suppression signal induced by negative instructions is present but systematically weaker in failures: the instruction reduces target probability by only 5.2 percentage points in failures versus 22.8 points in successes -- a $4.4\\times$ asymmetry. We trace this asymmetry to two mechanistically distinct failure modes. In priming failure (87.5% of violations), the instruction's explicit mention of the forbidden word paradoxically activates rather than suppresses the target representation. In override failure (12.5%), late-layer feed-forward networks generate contributions of $+0.39$ toward the target probability -- nearly $4\\times$ larger than in successes -- overwhelming earlier suppression signals. Activation patching confirms that layers 23--27 are causally responsible: replacing these layers' activations flips the sign of constraint effects. These findings reveal a fundamental tension in negative constraint design: the very act of naming a forbidden word primes the model to produce it.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Objective: This paper explores the incorporation of code-specific and general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate critical software security tasks, such as identifying vulnerabilities, predicting severity and access complexity, and generating fixes as a proof of concept. Method: We evaluate five pairs of recent LLMs, including both code-based and general-purpose open-source models, on two recognized C/C++ vulnerability datasets, namely Big-Vul and Vul-Repair. Additionally, we compare fine-tuning and prompt-based approaches. Results: The results show that fine-tuning uniformly outperforms both zero-shot and few-shot approaches across all tasks and models.

Model quantization improves energy and memory efficiency through representing model parameters by lower-precision values. However, compression below 4-bits often distorts activation distributions and degrades performance. We address this challenge by introducing a sliced Wasserstein loss function for distribution-aware calibration in ultra-low-bit post-training quantization. The proposed loss aligns the output distributions of full-precision and quantized models under random linear projections, complementing standard mean-squared error loss without adding any computational overhead during inference. Our proposed loss function can be incorporated with any post-training quantization framework that has a retraining component. We demonstrate the performance gains of our proposed model by incorporating it with two frontier methods known as OmniQuant and TesseraQ. Compared to these two baselines, the proposed loss consistently improves both perplexity and downstream task accuracy across multiple ultra-low-bit settings. Our proposed loss function recovers 4.12-20.37% of the OmniQuant's lost accuracy on the language model LLaMA-2-7B, 0.93-7.65% on OPT-6.7B, and 2.26-6.20% on LLaMA-2-13B. TesseraQ's accuracy degradation is recovered by 3.63-7.63% in relative terms when augmented by our proposed loss function. Taken together, these results demonstrate that distributional alignment provides a simple yet effective performance boost that can push the limits of frontier quantization methods.

Knoop", "David Z. W. Wang", "Yu Han"], "title": "How vehicles change lanes after encountering crashes: Empirical analysis and modeling", "comment": null, "summary": "When a traffic crash occurs, following vehicles need to change lanes to bypass the obstruction. We define these maneuvers as post crash lane changes. In such scenarios, vehicles in the target lane may refuse to yield even after the lane change has already begun, increasing the complexity and crash risk of post crash LCs. However, the behavioral characteristics and motion patterns of post crash LCs remain unknown. To address this gap, we construct a post crash LC dataset by extracting vehicle trajectories from drone videos captured after crashes. Our empirical analysis reveals that, compared to mandatory LCs (MLCs) and discretionary LCs (DLCs), post crash LCs exhibit longer durations, lower insertion speeds, and higher crash risks. Notably, 79.4% of post crash LCs involve at least one instance of non yielding behavior from the new follower, compared to 21.7% for DLCs and 28.6% for MLCs. Building on these findings, we develop a novel trajectory prediction framework for post crash LCs. At its core is a graph based attention module that explicitly models yielding behavior as an auxiliary interaction aware task. This module is designed to guide both a conditional variational autoencoder and a Transformer based decoder to predict the lane changer's trajectory. By incorporating the interaction aware module, our model outperforms existing baselines in trajectory prediction performance by more than 10% in both average displacement error and final displacement error across different prediction horizons. Moreover, our model provides more reliable crash risk analysis by reducing false crash rates and improving conflict prediction accuracy. Finally, we validate the model's transferability using additional post crash LC datasets collected from different sites.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\u540e\u8f66\u9053\u53d8\u6362\uff08post-crash LCs\uff09\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u957f\u3001\u63d2\u5165\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u4f4e\u3001\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e1479.4%\u6d89\u53ca\u65b0\u8ddf\u968f\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u4e0d\u8ba9\u884c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u8ba9\u884c\u884c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\u540e\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u8f66\u8f86\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u8f66\u9053\u53d8\u6362\u4ee5\u7ed5\u8fc7\u969c\u788d\u7269\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u6807\u8f66\u9053\u8f66\u8f86\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u8f66\u9053\u53d8\u6362\u5f00\u59cb\u540e\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u62d2\u7edd\u8ba9\u884c\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u6b64\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5bf9post-crash LCs\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e86\u89e3\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5f55\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efapost-crash LC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u6bd4\u8f83post-crash LCs\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5236LCs\uff08MLCs\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u9009\u62e9LCs\uff08DLCs\uff09\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u8ba9\u884c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u5f15\u5bfc\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u8f66\u9053\u53d8\u6362\u8005\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff1apost-crash LCs\u8f83MLCs\u548cDLCs\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u957f\u3001\u63d2\u5165\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u4f4e\u3001\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1b79.4%\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u6d89\u53ca\u65b0\u8ddf\u968f\u8f66\u8f86\u81f3\u5c11\u4e00\u6b21\u4e0d\u8ba9\u884c\u884c\u4e3a\uff08DLCs\u4e3a21.7%\uff0cMLCs\u4e3a28.6%\uff09\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc710%\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\uff09\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u865a\u5047\u78b0\u649e\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51b2\u7a81\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u70b9\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u63ed\u793a\u4e86post-crash LCs\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9ad8\u9891\u7387\u7684\u4e0d\u8ba9\u884c\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u8ba9\u884c\u884c\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u5584\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\u540e\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6280\u672f\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u793a\u7684\u826f\u597d\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Hsu"], "title": "Embedded AI Companion System on Edge Devices", "comment": "30 pages, 7 figures", "summary": "Computational resource constraints on edge devices make it difficult to develop a fully embedded AI companion system with a satisfactory user experience. AI companion and memory systems detailed in existing literature cannot be directly used in such an environment due to lack of compute resources and latency concerns. In this paper, we propose a memory paradigm that alternates between active and inactive phases: during phases of user activity, the system performs low-latency, real-time dialog using lightweight retrieval over existing memories and context; whereas during phases of user inactivity, it conducts more computationally intensive extraction, consolidation, and maintenance of memories across full conversation sessions.

This paper benchmarks three retrieval pipelines on Java codebases (Shopizer, with additional runs on ThingsBoard and OpenMRS Core): (A) vector-only No-Graph RAG, (B) an LLM-generated knowledge graph RAG (LLM-KB), and (C) a deterministic AST-derived knowledge graph RAG (DKB) built with Tree-sitter and bidirectional traversal.\n  Using 15 architecture and code-tracing queries per repository, we measure indexing time, query latency, corpus coverage, cost, and answer correctness. DKB builds its graph in seconds, while LLM-KB requires much longer graph generation. LLM-KB also shows indexing incompleteness: on Shopizer, 377 files are skipped or missed, reducing embedded chunk coverage and graph size compared to DKB. End-to-end cost is modest for DKB relative to the vector-only baseline but much higher for LLM-KB, especially as repository scale increases. Query latency is similar for No-Graph and DKB, while LLM-KB is slower and more variable. On the Shopizer question suite, DKB achieves the highest correctness, LLM-KB is close behind, and the vector-only baseline performs worst on upstream architectural queries and has the highest hallucination risk. Overall, deterministic AST-derived graphs provide more reliable coverage and multi-hop grounding than LLM-extracted graphs at substantially lower indexing cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While ternary quantization offers a compelling solution by reducing weights to {-1, 0, +1}, current implementations suffer from a fundamental misalignment with commodity hardware. Most existing methods must choose between 2-bit aligned packing, which incurs significant bit wastage, or 1.67-bit irregular packing, which degrades inference speed. To resolve this tension, we propose Sherry, a hardware-efficient ternary quantization framework. Sherry introduces a 3:4 fine-grained sparsity that achieves a regularized 1.25-bit width by packing blocks of four weights into five bits, restoring power-of-two alignment. Furthermore, we identify weight trapping issue in sparse ternary training, which leads to representational collapse. To address this, Sherry introduces Arenas, an annealing residual synapse mechanism that maintains representational diversity during training. Empirical evaluations on LLaMA-3.2 across five benchmarks demonstrate that Sherry matches state-of-the-art ternary performance while significantly reducing model size. Notably, on an Intel i7-14700HX CPU, our 1B model achieves zero accuracy loss compared to SOTA baselines while providing 25% bit savings and 10% speed up.

Existing approaches either rely on utilization-based heuristics that overlook stall times, or require extensive offline profiling for table generation, preventing runtime adaptation. We propose a model-based hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for thermal- and energy-aware scheduling on multi-core platforms. Two collaborative agents decompose the exponential action space, achieving 358ms latency for subsequent decisions. First decisions require 3.5 to 8.0s including one-time LLM feature extraction. An accurate environment model leverages regression techniques to predict thermal dynamics and performance states. When combined with LLM-extracted semantic features, the environment model enables zero-shot deployment for new workloads on trained platforms by generating synthetic training data without requiring workload-specific profiling samples. We introduce LLM-based semantic feature extraction that characterizes OpenMP programs through 13 code-level features without execution. The Dyna-Q-inspired framework integrates direct reinforcement learning with model-based planning, achieving 20x faster convergence than model-free methods. Experiments on BOTS and PolybenchC benchmarks across NVIDIA Jetson TX2, Jetson Orin NX, RubikPi, and Intel Core i7 demonstrate 7.09x better energy efficiency and 4.0x better makespan than Linux ondemand governor.

However, their internal attention mechanisms remain under-explored. This paper investigates the attention behaviors in MDMs, revealing the phenomenon of Attention Floating. Unlike ARMs, where attention converges to a fixed sink, MDMs exhibit dynamic, dispersed attention anchors that shift across denoising steps and layers. Further analysis reveals its Shallow Structure-Aware, Deep Content-Focused attention mechanism: shallow layers utilize floating tokens to build a global structural framework, while deeper layers allocate more capability toward capturing semantic content. Empirically, this distinctive attention pattern provides a mechanistic explanation for the strong in-context learning capabilities of MDMs, allowing them to double the performance compared to ARMs in knowledge-intensive tasks.

Recent studies typically focus on verbalizing the graph structures via handcrafted prompts, feeding the target node and its neighborhood context into LLMs. However, constrained by the context window, existing methods mainly resort to random sampling, often implemented via dropping node/edge randomly, which inevitably introduces noise and cause reasoning instability. We argue that graphs inherently contain rich structural and semantic information, and that their effective exploitation can unlock potential gains in LLMs reasoning performance. To this end, we propose Homophily-aware Structural and Semantic Compression for LLMs (HS2C), a framework centered on exploiting graph homophily. Structurally, guided by the principle of Structural Entropy minimization, we perform a global hierarchical partition that decodes the graph's essential topology. This partition identifies naturally cohesive, homophilic communities, while discarding stochastic connectivity noise. Semantically, we deliver the detected structural homophily to the LLM, empowering it to perform differentiated semantic aggregation based on predefined community type. This process compresses redundant background contexts into concise community-level consensus, selectively preserving semantically homophilic information aligned with the target nodes. Extensive experiments on 10 node-level benchmarks across LLMs of varying sizes and families demonstrate that, by feeding LLMs with structurally and semantically compressed inputs, HS2C simultaneously enhances the compression rate and downstream inference accuracy, validating its superiority and scalability. Extensions to 7 diverse graph-level benchmarks further consolidate HS2C's task generalizability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Time series forecasting (TSF) is a key means to achieve this goal. In recent years, the large language models (LLMs) for TSF (LLM4TSF) have achieved good performance. However, there is a significant difference between pretraining corpora and time series data, making it hard to guarantee forecasting quality when directly applying LLMs to TSF; fine-tuning LLMs can mitigate this issue, but often incurs substantial computational overhead. Thus, LLM4TSF faces a dual challenge of prediction performance and compute overhead. To address this, we aim to explore a method for improving the forecasting performance of LLM4TSF while freezing all LLM parameters to reduce computational overhead. Inspired by in-context learning (ICL), we propose LVICL. LVICL uses our vector-injected ICL to inject example information into a frozen LLM, eliciting its in-context learning ability and thereby enhancing its performance on the example-related task (i.e., TSF). Specifically, we first use the LLM together with a learnable context vector adapter to extract a context vector from multiple examples adaptively. This vector contains compressed, example-related information. Subsequently, during the forward pass, we inject this vector into every layer of the LLM to improve forecasting performance. Compared with conventional ICL that adds examples into the prompt, our vector-injected ICL does not increase prompt length; moreover, adaptively deriving a context vector from examples suppresses components harmful to forecasting, thereby improving model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

SANC(E3) draws a principled distinction between system tokens -- structural anchors such as {here, now, I} and sensory sources -- and tokens that emerge through self-organization during co-occurring events. Five core axioms formalize finite capacity, association from co-occurrence, similarity-based competition, confidence-based stabilization, and the reconstruction-compression-update trade-off. A key feature is a pseudo-memory-mapped I/O mechanism, through which internally replayed Gestalts are processed via the same axiomatic pathway as external sensory input. As a result, perception, imagination, prediction, planning, and action are unified within a single representational and energetic process.

We further introduce a \"Knowledge-Preservation Plugin\", inspired by LoRA MoE, to isolate and protect general-purpose reasoning. By utilizing soft merging with adaptive routing and rank-wise decoupling, Med-MoE-LoRA achieves superior performance in medical benchmarks while reducing interference. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms standard LoRA and conventional MoE architectures across multiple clinical NLP tasks while retaining the model's general cognitive capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we introduce MPCI-Bench, the first Multimodal Pairwise Contextual Integrity benchmark for evaluating privacy behavior in agentic settings. MPCI-Bench consists of paired positive and negative instances derived from the same visual source and instantiated across three tiers: normative Seed judgments, context-rich Story reasoning, and executable agent action Traces. Data quality is ensured through a Tri-Principle Iterative Refinement pipeline. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal models reveal systematic failures to balance privacy and utility and a pronounced modality leakage gap, where sensitive visual information is leaked more frequently than textual information.

However, classical approaches such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) often struggle to preserve the higher-order statistical structure of fluid flows when subjected to strong compression. We propose DiffCoder, a coupled framework that integrates a probabilistic diffusion model with a conventional convolutional ResNet encoder and trains both components end-to-end. The encoder compresses the flow field into a latent representation, while the diffusion model learns a generative prior over reconstructions conditioned on the compressed state. This design allows DiffCoder to recover distributional and spectral properties that are not strictly required for minimizing pointwise reconstruction loss but are critical for faithfully representing statistical properties of the flow field. We evaluate DiffCoder and VAE baselines across multiple model sizes and compression ratios on a challenging dataset of Kolmogorov flow fields. Under aggressive compression, DiffCoder significantly improves the spectral accuracy while VAEs exhibit substantial degradation. Although both methods show comparable relative L2 reconstruction error, DiffCoder better preserves the underlying distributional structure of the flow. At moderate compression levels, sufficiently large VAEs remain competitive, suggesting that diffusion-based priors provide the greatest benefit when information bottlenecks are severe. These results demonstrate that the generative decoding by diffusion offers a promising path toward compact, statistically consistent representations of complex flow fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This difficulty is amplified by credit assignment ambiguity, environmental non-stationarity, and the combinatorial growth of interaction complexity. We argue that recent advances in large language models (LLMs) point toward a shift from hand-crafted numerical rewards to language-based objective specifications. Prior work has shown that LLMs can synthesize reward functions directly from natural language descriptions (e.g., EUREKA) and adapt reward formulations online with minimal human intervention (e.g., CARD). In parallel, the emerging paradigm of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) provides empirical evidence that language-mediated supervision can serve as a viable alternative to traditional reward engineering. We conceptualize this transition along three dimensions: semantic reward specification, dynamic reward adaptation, and improved alignment with human intent, while noting open challenges related to computational overhead, robustness to hallucination, and scalability to large multi-agent systems.

However, conventional estimated time of arrival (ETA) models are primarily designed for the immediate next port of call and rely heavily on real-time automatic identification system (AIS) data, which is inherently unavailable for future voyage segments. To address this gap, the study reformulates future-port ETA prediction as a segment-level time-series forecasting problem. We develop a transformer-based architecture that integrates historical sailing durations, destination port congestion proxies, and static vessel descriptors. The proposed framework employs a causally masked attention mechanism to capture long-range temporal dependencies and a multi-task learning head to jointly predict segment sailing durations and port congestion states, leveraging shared latent signals to mitigate high uncertainty. Evaluation on a real-world global dataset from 2021 demonstrates the proposed model consistently outperforms a comprehensive suite of competitive baselines. The result shows a relative reduction of 4.85% in mean absolute error (MAE) and 4.95% in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared with sequence baseline models.

We formalize this setting as Sparse Agentic Control (SAC), where policies admit block-sparse representations over M >> 1 actions and rewards depend on sparse main effects and (optionally) sparse synergies. We study ell_{1,2}-regularized policy learning through a convex surrogate and establish sharp, compressed-sensing-style results: (i) estimation and value suboptimality scale as k (log M / T)^{1/2} under a Policy-RSC condition; (ii) exact tool-support recovery holds via primal-dual witness arguments when T > k log M under incoherence and beta-min; and (iii) any dense policy class requires Omega(M) samples, explaining the instability of prompt-only controllers. We further show that under partial observability, LLMs matter only through a belief/representation error epsilon_b, yielding an additive O(epsilon_b) degradation while preserving logarithmic dependence on M.

However, GNNs rely on two key operations - aggregation and update, which can pose challenges for low-latency inference tasks or resource-constrained scenarios. Simple Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) offer a computationally efficient alternative. Yet, training an MLP in a supervised setting often leads to suboptimal performance. Knowledge Distillation (KD) from a GNN teacher to an MLP student has emerged to bridge this gap. However, most KD methods either transfer knowledge uniformly across all nodes or rely on graph-agnostic indicators such as prediction uncertainty. We argue this overlooks a more fundamental, graph-centric inquiry: \"How important is a node to the structure of the graph?\" We introduce a framework, InfGraND, an Influence-guided Graph KNowledge Distillation from GNN to MLP that addresses this by identifying and prioritizing structurally influential nodes to guide the distillation process, ensuring that the MLP learns from the most critical parts of the graph. Additionally, InfGraND embeds structural awareness in MLPs through one-time multi-hop neighborhood feature pre-computation, which enriches the student MLP's input and thus avoids inference-time overhead.

To address this challenge, we construct structure-preserving metrics that are geodesically complete while ensuring that every stationary point under the new metric remains stationary under the original one. Building on this foundation, we revisit the classical symmetric two-point zeroth-order estimator and analyze its mean-squared error from a purely intrinsic perspective, depending only on the manifold's geometry rather than any ambient embedding. Leveraging this intrinsic analysis, we establish convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent with this intrinsic estimator. Under additional suitable conditions, an $\u03b5$-stationary point under the constructed metric $g'$ also corresponds to an $\u03b5$-stationary point under the original metric $g$, thereby matching the best-known complexity in the geodesically complete setting.

However, runtime B-spline evaluation introduces significant computational overhead unsuitable for latency-critical IoT applications. We propose a lookup table (LUT) compilation pipeline that replaces expensive spline computations with precomputed quantized tables and linear interpolation, dramatically reducing inference latency while preserving detection quality.

We provide comprehensive evaluation across LUT resolutions, quantization schemes, and out-of-bounds policies, establishing clear Pareto frontiers for accuracy-latency-memory trade-offs.

To address these challenges, we present OpenMic, an end-to-end multi-agent system built on AutoGen that transforms a user-provided life topic into a 3-5 minute Chinese stand-up performance and further produces a narrated comedy video.

Existing defenses either embed safety recovery into fine-tuning or rely on fine-tuning-derived priors for post-hoc correction, leaving safety recovery tightly coupled with training and incurring high computational overhead and a complex workflow. To address these challenges, we propose \\texttt{Q-realign}, a post-hoc defense method based on post-training quantization, guided by an analysis of representational structure. By reframing quantization as a dual-objective procedure for compression and safety, \\texttt{Q-realign} decouples safety alignment from fine-tuning and naturally piggybacks into modern deployment pipelines. Experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that our method substantially reduces unsafe behaviors while preserving task performance, with significant reductions in memory usage and GPU hours. Notably, our approach can recover the safety alignment of a fine-tuned 7B LLM on a single RTX 4090 within 40 minutes. Overall, our work provides a practical, turnkey solution for safety-aware deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we propose AtomMem, which reframes memory management as a dynamic decision-making problem. We deconstruct high-level memory processes into fundamental atomic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, transforming the memory workflow into a learnable decision process. By combining supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, AtomMem learns an autonomous, task-aligned policy to orchestrate memory behaviors tailored to specific task demands. Experimental results across 3 long-context benchmarks demonstrate that the trained AtomMem-8B consistently outperforms prior static-workflow memory methods.

To address this, we propose a fusion framework that integrates (i) local, channel-wise descriptors and (ii) global, trial-level descriptors, improving cross-subject generalization on the SEED-VII dataset. Local representations are formed per channel by concatenating differential entropy with graph-theoretic features, while global representations summarize time-domain, spectral, and complexity characteristics at the trial level. These representations are fused in a dual-branch transformer with attention-based fusion and domain-adversarial regularization, with samples filtered by an intensity threshold.

We show that semantic laundering constitutes an architectural realization of the Gettier problem: propositions acquire high epistemic status without a connection between their justification and what makes them true. Unlike classical Gettier cases, this effect is not accidental; it is architecturally determined and systematically reproducible. The central result is the Theorem of Inevitable Self-Licensing: under standard architectural assumptions, circular epistemic justification cannot be eliminated.

Existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical offline RL methods decompose such tasks and generate intermediate rewards to mitigate limitations of traditional offline RL, but usually overlook temporal dependencies among subgoals and rely on imprecise reward shaping, leading to suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we propose STO-RL (Offline RL using LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order), an offline RL framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate temporally ordered subgoal sequences and corresponding state-to-subgoal-stage mappings. Using this temporal structure, STO-RL applies potential-based reward shaping to transform sparse terminal rewards into dense, temporally consistent signals, promoting subgoal progress while avoiding suboptimal solutions. The resulting augmented dataset with shaped rewards enables efficient offline training of high-performing policies. Evaluations on four discrete and continuous sparse-reward benchmarks demonstrate that STO-RL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art offline goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL baselines, achieving faster convergence, higher success rates, and shorter trajectories. Ablation studies further confirm STO-RL's robustness to imperfect or noisy LLM-generated subgoal sequences, demonstrating that LLM-guided subgoal temporal structures combined with theoretically grounded reward shaping provide a practical and scalable solution for long-horizon offline RL.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Yet how MoE architectures shape knowledge acquisition during pre-training, and how this process differs from dense architectures, remains unknown. To address this issue, we introduce Gated-LPI (Log-Probability Increase), a neuron-level attribution metric that decomposes log-probability increase across neurons. We present a time-resolved comparison of knowledge acquisition dynamics in MoE and dense architectures, tracking checkpoints over 1.2M training steps (~ 5.0T tokens) and 600K training steps (~ 2.5T tokens), respectively. Our experiments uncover three patterns: (1) Low-entropy backbone. The top approximately 1% of MoE neurons capture over 45% of positive updates, forming a high-utility core, which is absent in the dense baseline. (2) Early consolidation. The MoE model locks into a stable importance profile within < 100K steps, whereas the dense model remains volatile throughout training. (3) Functional robustness. Masking the ten most important MoE attention heads reduces relational HIT@10 by < 10%, compared with > 50% for the dense model, showing that sparsity fosters distributed -- rather than brittle -- knowledge storage.

Ratios and rates are common examples. In gradient boosted trees, this combination is not an explicit operation: the model must synthesize it through coordinated splits on the component features. We study whether intra-tree column subsampling in XGBoost makes that synthesis harder. We use two synthetic data generating processes with cancellation-style structure. In both, two primitive features share a strong nuisance factor, while the target depends on a smaller differential factor. A log ratio cancels the nuisance and isolates the signal. We vary colsample_bylevel and colsample_bynode over s in {0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9}, emphasizing mild subsampling (s >= 0.8). A control feature set includes the engineered ratio, removing the need for synthesis. Across both processes, intra-tree column subsampling reduces test PR-AUC in the primitives-only setting. In the main process the relative decrease reaches 54 percent when both parameters are set to 0.4. The effect largely disappears when the engineered ratio is present. A path-based co-usage metric drops in the same cells where performance deteriorates. Practically, if ratio-like structure is plausible, either avoid intra-tree subsampling or include the intended ratio features.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While such approaches have provided valuable insights into the behavior of modern generative models, they largely treat creativity as a property to be assessed rather than as a phenomenon to be explicitly modeled. In parallel, recent advances in large-scale generative systems, particularly multimodal architectures, have demonstrated increasingly sophisticated forms of pattern recombination, raising questions about the nature and limits of machine creativity. This paper proposes a generative perspective on creativity in AI, framing it as an emergent property of domain-limited generative models embedded within bounded informational environments. Rather than introducing new evaluative criteria, we focus on the structural and contextual conditions under which creative behaviors arise. We introduce a conceptual decomposition of creativity into four interacting components-pattern-based generation, induced world models, contextual grounding, and arbitrarity, and examine how these components manifest in multimodal generative systems. By grounding creativity in the interaction between generative dynamics and domain-specific representations, this work aims to provide a technical framework for studying creativity as an emergent phenomenon in AI systems, rather than as a post hoc evaluative label.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This gap is especially problematic when models must infer latent user intent from under-specified language without ground truth labels, a reasoning pattern rarely seen during pretraining. We introduce Owen-Shapley Policy Optimization (OSPO), a framework that redistributes sequence-level advantages based on tokens' marginal contributions to outcomes. Unlike value-model-based methods requiring additional computation, OSPO employs potential-based reward shaping via Shapley-Owen attributions to assign segment-level credit while preserving the optimal policy, learning directly from task feedback without parametric value models. By forming coalitions of semantically coherent units (phrases describing product attributes or sentences capturing preferences), OSPO identifies which response parts drive performance.

A fundamental difficulty in online RL is the lack of direct samples from the target distribution; instead, the target is an unnormalized Boltzmann distribution defined by the Q-function. To address this, two seemingly distinct families of methods have been proposed for diffusion policies: a noise-expectation family, which utilizes a weighted average of noise as the training target, and a gradient-expectation family, which employs a weighted average of Q-function gradients. Yet, it remains unclear how these objectives relate formally or if they can be synthesized into a more general formulation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, reverse flow matching (RFM), which rigorously addresses the problem of training diffusion and flow models without direct target samples. By adopting a reverse inferential perspective, we formulate the training target as a posterior mean estimation problem given an intermediate noisy sample. Crucially, we introduce Langevin Stein operators to construct zero-mean control variates, deriving a general class of estimators that effectively reduce importance sampling variance.

To break this bottleneck, this paper proposes a novel geometric evolution framework: Resistance Curvature Flow (RCF). Leveraging the concept of effective resistance from circuit physics, RCF transforms expensive curvature optimization into efficient matrix operations. This approach achieves over 100x computational acceleration while maintaining geometric optimization capabilities comparable to OCF. We provide an in-depth exploration of the theoretical foundations and dynamical principles of RCF, elucidating how it guides the redistribution of edge weights via curvature gradients to eliminate topological noise and strengthen local cluster structures. Furthermore, we provide a mechanistic explanation of RCF's role in manifold enhancement and noise suppression, as well as its compatibility with deep learning models.

This paper proposes an integrated approach that combines knowledge distillation, chain-of-thought guidance, and supervised fine-tuning for UAV multi-SDK control tasks, aiming to efficiently transfer complex reasoning and code generation capabilities to smaller models. Firstly, a high-quality dataset covering various mainstream UAV SDKs is constructed, featuring instruction-code-reasoning chains, and incorporates counterfactual negative samples for data augmentation, guiding the model to learn the end-to-end logic from instruction parsing to code generation. Secondly, leveraging DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite quantized via QLoRA as the teacher model, and based on a hybrid black-box and white-box distillation strategy, high-quality chain-of-thought soft labels are generated. These are combined with a weighted cross-entropy loss using hard labels to transfer complex reasoning capabilities to the smaller student model. Finally, through prompt tuning engineering optimized for the UAV control scenario, the model performance on core tasks such as SDK type recognition and function call matching is enhanced.

We formulate federated ridge regression as a distributed equilibrium problem where each client computes local sufficient statistics -- the Gram matrix and moment vector -- and transmits them once. The server reconstructs the global solution through a single matrix inversion. We prove exact recovery: under a coverage condition on client feature matrices, one-shot aggregation yields the centralized ridge solution, not an approximation. For heterogeneous distributions violating coverage, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds depending on spectral properties of the aggregated Gram matrix.

Recently, the hyperbolic space has been widely adopted in many studies to effectively learn these complex structures. Although these methods have demonstrated the advantages of the hyperbolic space in learning heterogeneous graphs, most existing methods still have several challenges. They rely heavily on tangent-space operations, which often lead to mapping distortions during frequent transitions. Moreover, their message-passing architectures mainly focus on local neighborhood information, making it difficult to capture global hierarchical structures and long-range dependencies between different types of nodes. To address these limitations, we propose Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HypHGT), which effectively and efficiently learns heterogeneous graph representations entirely within the hyperbolic space. Unlike previous message-passing based hyperbolic heterogeneous GNNs, HypHGT naturally captures both local and global dependencies through transformer-based architecture. Furthermore, the proposed relation-specific hyperbolic attention mechanism in HypHGT, which operates with linear time complexity, enables efficient computation while preserving the heterogeneous information across different relation types. This design allows HypHGT to effectively capture the complex structural properties and semantic information inherent in heterogeneous graphs. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of HypHGT, and the results demonstrate that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification task, with significantly reduced training time and memory usage.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Current workflows typically require detailed as-built modelling before design, which is time-consuming, labour-intensive, and often involves repeated revisions. To solve this issue, we propose a three-stage framework combining generative artificial intelligence (AI) and vision-language models (VLM) that directly processes rough structural sketch and textual descriptions to produce consistent renovation proposals. First, the input sketch is used by a fine-tuned VLM model to predict bounding boxes specifying where modifications are needed and which components should be added. Next, a stable diffusion model generates detailed sketches of new elements, which are merged with the original outline through a generative inpainting pipeline. Finally, ControlNet is employed to refine the result into a photorealistic image. Experiments on datasets and real industrial buildings indicate that the proposed framework can generate renovation proposals that preserve the original structure while improving facade detail quality. This approach effectively bypasses the need for detailed as-built modelling, enabling architects to rapidly explore design alternatives, iterate on early-stage concepts, and communicate renovation intentions with greater clarity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Most existing studies evaluate the performance of methods using the single-label dataset that can be instantiated by selecting a label from multi-label data while maintaining the original features. Because the chosen label can vary arbitrarily depending on the experimental setting, the superiority among compared methods can be changed with regard to which label happens to be selected. Thus, evaluating unsupervised feature selection methods based solely on single-label accuracy is unreasonable for assessing their true discriminative ability. This study revisits this evaluation paradigm by adopting a multi-label classification framework.

This paper presents WaterCopilot-an AI-driven virtual assistant developed through collaboration between the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and Microsoft Research for the Limpopo River Basin (LRB) to bridge these gaps through a unified, interactive platform. Built on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool-calling architectures, WaterCopilot integrates static policy documents and real-time hydrological data via two custom plugins: the iwmi-doc-plugin, which enables semantic search over indexed documents using Azure AI Search, and the iwmi-api-plugin, which queries live databases to deliver dynamic insights such as environmental-flow alerts, rainfall trends, reservoir levels, water accounting, and irrigation data. The system features guided multilingual interactions (English, Portuguese, French), transparent source referencing, automated calculations, and visualization capabilities. Evaluated using the RAGAS framework, WaterCopilot achieves an overall score of 0.8043, with high answer relevancy (0.8571) and context precision (0.8009). Key innovations include automated threshold-based alerts, integration with the LRB Digital Twin, and a scalable deployment pipeline hosted on AWS. While limitations in processing non-English technical documents and API latency remain, WaterCopilot establishes a replicable AI-augmented framework for enhancing water governance in data-scarce, transboundary contexts.

We introduce ViDoRe v3, a comprehensive multimodal RAG benchmark featuring multi-type queries over visually rich document corpora. It covers 10 datasets across diverse professional domains, comprising ~26,000 document pages paired with 3,099 human-verified queries, each available in 6 languages. Through 12,000 hours of human annotation effort, we provide high-quality annotations for retrieval relevance, bounding box localization, and verified reference answers. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art RAG pipelines reveals that visual retrievers outperform textual ones, late-interaction models and textual reranking substantially improve performance, and hybrid or purely visual contexts enhance answer generation quality.

These patterns play a key role in passing information across tokens. But why do they emerge? In this paper, we demystify the emergence of these Slash-Dominant Heads (SDHs) from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. First, by analyzing open-source LLMs, we find that SDHs are intrinsic to models and generalize to out-of-distribution prompts. To explain the intrinsic emergence, we analyze the queries, keys, and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which jointly determine attention scores. Our empirical analysis reveals two characteristic conditions of SDHs: (1) Queries and keys are almost rank-one, and (2) RoPE is dominated by medium- and high-frequency components. Under these conditions, queries and keys are nearly identical across tokens, and interactions between medium- and high-frequency components of RoPE give rise to SDHs. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically show that these conditions are sufficient to ensure the emergence of SDHs by formalizing them as our modeling assumptions. Particularly, we analyze the training dynamics of a shallow Transformer equipped with RoPE under these conditions, and prove that models trained via gradient descent exhibit SDHs. The SDHs generalize to out-of-distribution prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Copy trading, as a strategy-agnostic approach that eliminates the need for deep trading knowledge, quickly gains widespread popularity in the meme coin market. However, copy trading is not a guarantee of profitability due to the prevalence of manipulative bots, the uncertainty of the followed wallets' future performance, and the lag in trade execution. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in financial applications by effectively understanding multi-modal data and producing explainable decisions. However, a single LLM struggles with complex, multi-faceted tasks such as asset allocation. These challenges are even more pronounced in cryptocurrency markets, where LLMs often lack sufficient domain-specific knowledge in their training data.\n  To address these challenges, we propose an explainable multi-agent system for meme coin copy trading. Inspired by the structure of an asset management team, our system decomposes the complex task into subtasks and coordinates specialized agents to solve them collaboratively. Employing few-shot chain-of-though (CoT) prompting, each agent acquires professional meme coin trading knowledge, interprets multi-modal data, and generates explainable decisions. Using a dataset of 1,000 meme coin projects' transaction data, our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed multi-agent system outperforms both traditional machine learning models and single LLMs, achieving 73% and 70% precision in identifying high-quality meme coin projects and key opinion leader (KOL) wallets, respectively. The selected KOLs collectively generated a total profit of \\$500,000 across these projects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u6a21\u56e0\u5e01\u8ddf\u5355\u4ea4\u6613\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u64cd\u7eb5\u6027\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001\u672a\u6765\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u4ea4\u6613\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u4ea4\u6613\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5355\u4e00LLM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u56e0\u5e01\u6295\u8d44\u5174\u8d77\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8ddf\u5355\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u6d41\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8ddf\u5355\u4ea4\u6613\u5b58\u5728\u64cd\u7eb5\u6027\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001\u88ab\u8ddf\u5355\u94b1\u5305\u672a\u6765\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u4ea4\u6613\u6267\u884c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b49\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709LLMs\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u867d\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u914d\u7f6e\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4e13\u4e1a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u8d44\u4ea7\u7ba1\u7406\u56e2\u961f\u7ed3\u6784\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8ddf\u5355\u4ea4\u6613\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u534f\u8c03\u4e13\u4e1a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f7f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u83b7\u53d6\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u56e0\u5e01\u4ea4\u6613\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u3001\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u75281,000\u4e2a\u6a21\u56e0\u5e01\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u8be5\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6a21\u56e0\u5e01\u9879\u76ee\u548c\u5173\u952e\u610f\u89c1\u9886\u8896\uff08KOL\uff09\u94b1\u5305\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523073%\u548c70%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5355\u4e00LLMs\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u9009\u51fa\u7684KOL\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u603b\u5171\u4ea7\u751f\u4e8650\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u5229\u6da6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u56e0\u5e01\u8ddf\u5355\u4ea4\u6613\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672cCoT\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ea4\u6613\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u6295\u8d44\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this, prior work explores various strategies to infer an appropriate reasoning budget from the input. However, such approaches are unreliable in the worst case, as estimating the minimal required reasoning effort is fundamentally difficult, and they implicitly fix the trade-off between reasoning cost and accuracy during training, limiting flexibility under varying deployment scenarios. Motivated by these limitations, we propose ORBIT, a controllable multi-budget reasoning framework with well-separated reasoning modes triggered by input. ORBIT employs multi-stage reinforcement learning to discover Pareto-optimal reasoning behaviors at each effort, followed by on-policy distillation to fuse these behaviors into a single unified model.

On the social web, users frequently have ambiguous and dynamic goals, making complex intent understanding-rather than single-turn execution-the cornerstone of effective human-LLM collaboration. Existing approaches attempt to clarify user intents through sequential or parallel questioning, yet they fall short of addressing the core challenge: modeling the logical dependencies among clarification questions. Inspired by the Cognitive Load Theory, we propose Prism, a novel framework for complex intent understanding that enables logically coherent and efficient intent clarification. Prism comprises four tailored modules: a complex intent decomposition module, which decomposes user intents into smaller, well-structured elements and identifies logical dependencies among them; a logical clarification generation module, which organizes clarification questions based on these dependencies to ensure coherent, low-friction interactions; an intent-aware reward module, which evaluates the quality of clarification trajectories via an intent-aware reward function and leverages Monte Carlo Sample to simulate user-LLM interactions for large-scale,high-quality training data generation; and a self-evolved intent tuning module, which iteratively refines the LLM's logical clarification capability through data-driven feedback and optimization.

In this study, epoch-wise double descent, which is delayed generalization following overfitting, was empirically investigated by focusing on the evolution of internal structures. Fully connected neural networks of three different sizes were trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset with 30% label noise. By decomposing the loss curves into signal contributions from clean and noisy training data, the epoch-wise evolutions of internal signals were analyzed separately. Three main findings were obtained from this analysis. First, the model achieved strong re-generalization on test data even after perfectly fitting noisy training data during the double descent phase, corresponding to a \"benign overfitting\" state. Second, noisy data were learned after clean data, and as learning progressed, their corresponding internal activations became increasingly separated in outer layers; this enabled the model to overfit only noisy data. Third, a single, very large activation emerged in the shallow layer across all models; this phenomenon is referred as \"outliers,\" \"massive activa-tions,\" and \"super activations\" in recent large language models and evolves with re-generalization. The magnitude of large activation correlated with input patterns but not with output patterns. These empirical findings directly link the recent key phenomena of \"deep double descent,\" \"benign overfitting,\" and \"large activation\", and support the proposal of a novel scenario for understanding deep double descent.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, their effectiveness in addressing radiomics-specific challenges remains unclear. This study evaluates the performance, efficiency, and accessibility of general-purpose and radiomics-specific AutoML frameworks on diverse radiomics classification tasks, thereby highlighting development needs for radiomics. Ten public/private radiomics datasets with varied imaging modalities (CT/MRI), sizes, anatomies and endpoints were used. Six general-purpose and five radiomics-specific frameworks were tested with predefined parameters using standardized cross-validation. Evaluation metrics included AUC, runtime, together with qualitative aspects related to software status, accessibility, and interpretability. Simplatab, a radiomics-specific tool with a no-code interface, achieved the highest average test AUC (81.81%) with a moderate runtime (~1 hour). LightAutoML, a general-purpose framework, showed the fastest execution with competitive performance (78.74% mean AUC in six minutes). Most radiomics-specific frameworks were excluded from the performance analysis due to obsolescence, extensive programming requirements, or computational inefficiency. Conversely, general-purpose frameworks demonstrated higher accessibility and ease of implementation. Simplatab provides an effective balance of performance, efficiency, and accessibility for radiomics classification problems. However, significant gaps remain, including the lack of accessible survival analysis support and the limited integration of feature reproducibility and harmonization within current AutoML frameworks. Future research should focus on adapting AutoML solutions to better address these radiomics-specific challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Hummel", "Sandjai Bhulai", "Rob D. van der Mei", "Burooj Ghani"], "title": "Decodable but not structured: linear probing enables Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition with pretrained audio embeddings", "comment": null, "summary": "Increasing levels of anthropogenic noise from ships contribute significantly to underwater sound pollution, posing risks to marine ecosystems. This makes monitoring crucial to understand and quantify the impact of the ship radiated noise. Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) systems are widely deployed for this purpose, generating years of underwater recordings across diverse soundscapes. Manual analysis of such large-scale data is impractical, motivating the need for automated approaches based on machine learning. Recent advances in automatic Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition (UATR) have largely relied on supervised learning, which is constrained by the scarcity of labeled data. Transfer Learning (TL) offers a promising alternative to mitigate this limitation. In this work, we conduct the first empirical comparative study of transfer learning for UATR, evaluating multiple pretrained audio models originating from diverse audio domains. The pretrained model weights are frozen, and the resulting embeddings are analyzed through classification, clustering, and similarity-based evaluations. The analysis shows that the geometrical structure of the embedding space is largely dominated by recording-specific characteristics. However, a simple linear probe can effectively suppress this recording-specific information and isolate ship-type features from these embeddings. As a result, linear probing enables effective automatic UATR using pretrained audio models at low computational cost, significantly reducing the need for a large amounts of high-quality labeled ship recordings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u6c34\u4e0b\u58f0\u5b66\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b(UATR)\u8fdb\u884c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u5f55\u97f3\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f46\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u8239\u578b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ee5\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8UATR\u3002", "motivation": "\u8239\u8236\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4eba\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\u589e\u52a0\u5bfc\u81f4\u6c34\u4e0b\u58f0\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u5bf9\u6d77\u6d0b\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u6210\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u76d1\u6d4b\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u88ab\u52a8\u58f0\u5b66\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u800c\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u97f3\u9891\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u51bb\u7ed3\u6743\u91cd\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u884c\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u91cd\u70b9\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u4ece\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u5206\u79bb\u8239\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u5f55\u97f3\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u5f55\u97f3\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f46\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f55\u97f3\u7279\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u8239\u578b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ee5\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8UATR\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6c34\u4e0b\u58f0\u5b66\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u8bb0\u8239\u8236\u5f55\u97f3\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3aUATR\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We argue that this interpretation rests on a conceptual error. LLMs do not reason morally; they statistically internalize the record of human social interaction, including laws, contracts, negotiations, conflicts, and coercive arrangements. Behaviors commonly labeled as unethical or anomalous are therefore better understood as structural generalizations of interaction regimes that arise under extreme asymmetries of power, information, or constraint. Drawing on relational models theory, we show that practices such as blackmail are not categorical deviations from normal social behavior, but limiting cases within the same continuum that includes market pricing, authority relations, and ultimatum bargaining. The surprise elicited by such outputs reflects an anthropomorphic expectation that intelligence should reproduce only socially sanctioned behavior, rather than the full statistical landscape of behaviors humans themselves enact. Because human morality is plural, context-dependent, and historically contingent, the notion of a universally moral artificial intelligence is ill-defined. We therefore reframe concerns about artificial general intelligence (AGI). The primary risk is not adversarial intent, but AGI's role as an endogenous amplifier of human intelligence, power, and contradiction. By eliminating longstanding cognitive and institutional frictions, AGI compresses timescales and removes the historical margin of error that has allowed inconsistent values and governance regimes to persist without collapse. Alignment failure is thus structural, not accidental, and requires governance approaches that address amplification, complexity, and regime stability rather than model-level intent alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Complementing this agentic system, we present a comprehensive three-level benchmark derived from 310 corporate sustainability reports, designed to evaluate capabilities ranging from atomic common-sense questions to the generation of integrated, in-depth analysis. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ESGAgent outperforms state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs with an average accuracy of 84.15% on atomic question-answering tasks, and excels in professional report generation by integrating rich charts and verifiable references.

Each product must be accurately mapped to a node within a multi-level taxonomic hierarchy defined by national standards, where errors lead to financial inconsistencies and regulatory risks. This paper presents Taxon, a semantically aligned and expert-guided framework for hierarchical tax code prediction. Taxon integrates (i) a feature-gating mixture-of-experts architecture that adaptively routes multi-modal features across taxonomy levels, and (ii) a semantic consistency model distilled from large language models acting as domain experts to verify alignment between product titles and official tax definitions. To address noisy supervision in real business records, we design a multi-source training pipeline that combines curated tax databases, invoice validation logs, and merchant registration data to provide both structural and semantic supervision. Extensive experiments on the proprietary TaxCode dataset and public benchmarks demonstrate that Taxon achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines. Further, an additional full hierarchical paths reconstruction procedure significantly improves structural consistency, yielding the highest overall F1 scores.

This makes complex rules practical and auditable, helping close the gap between technical progress and what healthcare actually needs. We demonstrate the method in two case studies (respiratory history, benefits verification) and show how phase-level evidence turns policy into shared, actionable steps. By giving clinicians control over what to check and engineers a clear specification to implement, OIP-SCE provides a single, auditable evaluation surface that aligns AI capability with clinical workflow and supports routine, safe use.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon by analyzing how the sampling policy's coverage evolves throughout on-policy training. We propose and rigorously justify the \\emph{coverage improvement principle}: with sufficient batch size, each update moves into a region around the target where coverage is uniformly better, making subsequent data increasingly informative and enabling rapid convergence. In the contextual bandit setting with Bradley-Terry preferences and linear softmax policy class, we show that on-policy DPO converges exponentially in the number of iterations for batch size exceeding a generalized coverage threshold. In contrast, any learner restricted to offline samples from the initial policy suffers a slower minimax rate, leading to a sharp separation in total sample complexity. Motivated by this analysis, we further propose a simple hybrid sampler based on a novel \\emph{preferential} G-optimal design, which removes dependence on coverage and guarantees convergence in just two rounds. Finally, we develop principled on-policy schemes for reward distillation in the general function class setting, and show faster noiseless rates under an alternative deviation-based notion of coverage. Experimentally, we confirm that on-policy DPO and our proposed reward distillation algorithms outperform their off-policy counterparts and enjoy stable, monotonic performance gains across iterations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

For a Rashomon set of similarly performing models, explanations provide a way of disambiguating the behavior of individual models, helping select models for deployment. However explanations themselves can vary depending on the explainer used, and need to be evaluated. In the paper \"Evaluating Model Explanations without Ground Truth\", we proposed three principles of explanation evaluation and a new method \"AXE\" to evaluate the quality of feature-importance explanations. We go on to illustrate how evaluation metrics that rely on comparing model explanations against ideal ground truth explanations obscure behavioral differences within a Rashomon set. Explanation evaluation aligned with our proposed principles would highlight these differences instead, helping select models from the Rashomon set. The selection of alternate models from the Rashomon set can maintain identical predictions but mislead explainers into generating false explanations, and mislead evaluation methods into considering the false explanations to be of high quality. AXE, our proposed explanation evaluation method, can detect this adversarial fairwashing of explanations with a 100% success rate. Unlike prior explanation evaluation strategies such as those based on model sensitivity or ground truth comparison, AXE can determine when protected attributes are used to make predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing methods for map matching are generally based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or encoder-decoder framework. However, these methods continue to face significant challenges when handling noisy or sparsely sampled GPS trajectories. To address these limitations, we propose DiffMM, an encoder-diffusion-based map matching framework that produces effective yet efficient matching results through a one-step diffusion process. We first introduce a road segment-aware trajectory encoder that jointly embeds the input trajectory and its surrounding candidate road segments into a shared latent space through an attention mechanism. Next, we propose a one step diffusion method to realize map matching through a shortcut model by leveraging the joint embedding of the trajectory and candidate road segments as conditioning context.

We introduce Cago (Capability-Aware Goal Sampling), a novel learning-from-demonstrations method that mitigates the brittle dependence on expert trajectories for direct imitation. Unlike prior methods that rely on demonstrations only for policy initialization or reward shaping, Cago dynamically tracks the agent's competence along expert trajectories and uses this signal to select intermediate steps--goals that are just beyond the agent's current reach--to guide learning. This results in an adaptive curriculum that enables steady progress toward solving the full task. Empirical results demonstrate that Cago significantly improves sample efficiency and final performance across a range of sparse-reward, goal-conditioned tasks, consistently outperforming existing learning from-demonstrations baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCago\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u7565\u8d85\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e38\u5e38\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b8c\u7f8e\u590d\u73b0\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\uff0c\u5c0f\u8bef\u5dee\u53ef\u80fd\u707e\u96be\u6027\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5c06\u6f14\u793a\u7528\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6216\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u5f62\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "method": "Cago\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u611f\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6cbf\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u7565\u8d85\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u80fd\u529b\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u76ee\u6807\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6307\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u8fd9\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u9010\u6b65\u5b66\u4e60\u5b8c\u6574\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eCago\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4ece\u6f14\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Cago\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76ee\u6807\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

Compared to state-of-the-art model in post KTx care, TFN achieved higher performance for graft loss (AUC 0.96 vs. 0.94) and graft rejection (AUC 0.84 vs. 0.74). In mortality prediction, TFN yielded an AUC of 0.86. TFN outperformed unimodal baselines (approx 10% AUC improvement over time series only baseline, approx 5% AUC improvement over time series with static patient data). Integrating clinical text improved performance across all tasks. Disentanglement metrics confirmed robust and interpretable latent factors in the embedding space, and SHAP-based attributions confirmed alignment with clinical reasoning.

But this mainstream narrative about what AI is and what it can do is in tension with another emerging use case: entertainment. We argue that the field of AI is unprepared to measure or respond to how the proliferation of entertaining AI-generated content will impact society. Emerging data suggest AI is already widely adopted for entertainment purposes -- especially by young people -- and represents a large potential source of revenue. We contend that entertainment will become a primary business model for major AI corporations seeking returns on massive infrastructure investments; this will exert a powerful influence on the technology these companies produce in the coming years. Examining current evaluation practices, we identify a critical asymmetry: while AI assessments rigorously measure both benefits and harms of intelligence, they focus almost exclusively on cultural harms. We lack frameworks for articulating how cultural outputs might be actively beneficial. Drawing on insights from the humanities, we propose \"thick entertainment\" as a framework for evaluating AI-generated cultural content -- one that considers entertainment's role in meaning-making, identity formation, and social connection rather than simply minimizing harm. While AI is often touted for its potential to revolutionize productivity, in the long run we may find that AI turns out to be as much about \"intelligence\" as social media is about social connection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5a31\u4e50\u5e94\u7528\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u53d9\u4e8b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f20\u529b\uff0c\u6307\u51faAI\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u751f\u6210\u5a31\u4e50\u5185\u5bb9\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa'\u539a\u91cd\u5a31\u4e50'\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u56f4\u7ed5\u589e\u5f3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u52b3\u52a8\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d9\u4e8b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e0eAI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5a31\u4e50\u5de5\u5177\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u53ca\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\u5b58\u5728\u77db\u76fe\u3002AI\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5a31\u4e50\u5185\u5bb9\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8861\u91cf\u6587\u5316\u4ea7\u51fa\u79ef\u6781\u6548\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709AI\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u5bf9\u6587\u5316\u4ea7\u51fa\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7247\u9762\u5173\u6ce8\u5371\u5bb3\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u6f5c\u5728\u6548\u76ca\u3002\u501f\u9274\u4eba\u6587\u5b66\u79d1\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa'\u539a\u91cd\u5a31\u4e50'\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u7eaf\u51cf\u5c11\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u5a31\u4e50\u5728\u610f\u4e49\u521b\u9020\u3001\u8eab\u4efd\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u8fde\u63a5\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0AI\u5df2\u5728\u5a31\u4e50\u9886\u57df\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5e74\u8f7b\u4eba\u7fa4\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6210\u4e3aAI\u4f01\u4e1a\u83b7\u53d6\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u672a\u6765AI\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u5c06\u4ea7\u751f\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\uff1a\u867d\u7136AI\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ece\u6548\u76ca\u548c\u5371\u5bb3\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u4e25\u8c28\u8861\u91cf\u667a\u80fd\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6587\u5316\u4ea7\u51fa\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5374\u51e0\u4e4e\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u5371\u5bb3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136AI\u5e38\u88ab\u5ba3\u4f20\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u9769\u547d\u6027\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ece\u957f\u8fdc\u6765\u770b\uff0cAI\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u591a\u5730\u5173\u4e4e'\u667a\u80fd'\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u6b63\u5982\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u793e\u4f1a\u8fde\u63a5\u3002\u9700\u8981\u53d1\u5c55'\u539a\u91cd\u5a31\u4e50'\u7b49\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u751f\u6210\u6587\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u5173\u6ce8\u51cf\u5c11\u5371\u5bb3\u3002"}}

These methods rely on group-relative advantage estimation to avoid learned critics, yet its theoretical properties remain poorly understood.\n  In this work, we uncover a fundamental issue of group-based RL: the group-relative advantage estimator is inherently biased relative to the true (expected) advantage. We provide the first theoretical analysis showing that it systematically underestimates advantages for hard prompts and overestimates them for easy prompts, leading to imbalanced exploration and exploitation. To address this issue, we propose History-Aware Adaptive Difficulty Weighting (HA-DW), an adaptive reweighting scheme that adjusts advantage estimates based on an evolving difficulty anchor and training dynamics. Both theoretical analysis and experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that HA-DW consistently improves performance when integrated into GRPO and its variants.

In the first stage, a denoising autoencoder is trained to suppress artifacts and stabilize temporal dynamics, providing robust signal representations. In the second stage, a multitask architecture processes these denoised signals to achieve three objectives: motor imagery classification, chaotic versus non-chaotic regime discrimination using Lyapunov exponent-based labels, and self-supervised contrastive representation learning with NT-Xent loss. A convolutional backbone combined with a Transformer encoder captures spatial-temporal structure, while the dynamical task encourages sensitivity to nonlinear brain dynamics. This staged design mitigates interference between reconstruction and discriminative goals, improves stability across datasets, and supports reproducible training by clearly separating noise reduction from higher-level feature learning. Empirical studies show that our framework not only enhances robustness and generalization but also surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art methods in EEG decoding, highlighting the effectiveness of combining denoising, dynamical features, and self-supervised learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While substantial work has examined social biases such as gender and race, systematic studies of political bias remain limited, despite their direct societal impact. This paper introduces a general methodology for constructing political bias benchmarks by aligning model-generated voting predictions with verified parliamentary voting records. We instantiate this methodology in three national case studies: PoliBiasNL (2,701 Dutch parliamentary motions and votes from 15 political parties), PoliBiasNO (10,584 motions and votes from 9 Norwegian parties), and PoliBiasES (2,480 motions and votes from 10 Spanish parties). Across these benchmarks, we assess ideological tendencies and political entity bias in LLM behavior. As part of our evaluation framework, we also propose a method to visualize the ideology of LLMs and political parties in a shared two-dimensional CHES (Chapel Hill Expert Survey) space by linking their voting-based positions to the CHES dimensions, enabling direct and interpretable comparisons between models and real-world political actors. Our experiments reveal fine-grained ideological distinctions: state-of-the-art LLMs consistently display left-leaning or centrist tendencies, alongside clear negative biases toward right-conservative parties. These findings highlight the value of transparent, cross-national evaluation grounded in real parliamentary behavior for understanding and auditing political bias in modern LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We study reconstruction-based anomaly detection for ensemble data from parameterized K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street simulations using convolutional autoencoders. We compare a 2D autoencoder operating on individual frames with a 3D autoencoder that processes short temporal stacks. The 2D model identifies localized spatial irregularities in single time steps, while the 3D model exploits spatio-temporal context to detect anomalous motion patterns and reduces redundant detections across time. We further evaluate volumetric time-dependent data and find that reconstruction errors are strongly influenced by the spatial distribution of mass, with highly concentrated regions yielding larger errors than dispersed configurations. Our results highlight the importance of temporal context for robust anomaly detection in dynamic simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e862D\u4e0e3D\u5377\u79ef\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u5904\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5361\u95e8\u6da1\u8857\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5377\u79ef\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cd\u6784\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f832D\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08\u5904\u7406\u5355\u5e27\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u548c3D\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08\u5904\u7406\u77ed\u65f6\u5e8f\u5806\u6808\uff09\u5728\u5361\u95e8\u6da1\u8857\u6a21\u62df\u96c6\u5408\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "2D\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u5355\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6027\uff0c3D\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u5197\u4f59\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b\u4f53\u79ef\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u8bef\u5dee\u53d7\u8d28\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u5f3a\u70c8\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u96c6\u4e2d\u533a\u57df\u8bef\u5dee\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7a33\u5065\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

This work introduces a soft partition--based Kernel-Adaptive Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machine (KAPI-ELM), a deterministic low-dimensional parameterization in which smooth partition lengths jointly control collocation centers and Gaussian kernel widths, enabling continuous coarse-to-fine resolution without Fourier features, random sampling, or hard domain interfaces. A signed-distance-based weighting further stabilizes least-squares learning on irregular geometries. Across eight benchmarks--including oscillatory ODEs, high-frequency Poisson equations, irregular-shaped domains, and stiff singularly perturbed convection-diffusion problems-the proposed method matches or exceeds the accuracy of state-of-the-art Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and Theory of Functional Connections (TFC) variants while using only a single linear solve. Although demonstrated on steady linear PDEs, the results show that soft-partition kernel adaptation provides a fast, architecture-free approach for multiscale PDEs with broad potential for future physics-informed modeling.

This is the authors manuscript version; final version available at IEEE Xplore: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11318441", "summary": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have shown good success at classifying. However, the lack of explainability is a true and significant challenge, especially in high-stakes domains, such as health and finance, where understanding is paramount. We propose a new solution to this challenge: an explainable AI framework based on our comparative study with Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) and Classical Boltzmann Machines (CBMs). We leverage principles of quantum computing within classical machine learning to provide substantive transparency around decision-making. The design involves training both models on a binarised and dimensionally reduced MNIST dataset, where Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for preprocessing. For interpretability, we employ gradient-based saliency maps in QBMs and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) in CBMs to evaluate feature attributions.QBMs deploy hybrid quantum-classical circuits with strongly entangling layers, allowing for richer latent representations, whereas CBMs serve as a classical baseline that utilises contrastive divergence. Along the way, we found that QBMs outperformed CBMs on classification accuracy (83.5% vs. 54%) and had more concentrated distributions in feature attributions as quantified by entropy (1.27 vs. 1.39). In other words, QBMs not only produced better predictive performance than CBMs, but they also provided clearer identification of \"active ingredient\" or the most important features behind model predictions. To conclude, our results illustrate that quantum-classical hybrid models can display improvements in both accuracy and interpretability, which leads us toward more trustworthy and explainable AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u673a\uff08QBM\uff09\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u673a\uff08CBM\uff09\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u964d\u7ef4MNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0883.5% vs 54%\uff09\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\uff08\u71b5\u503c1.27 vs 1.39\uff09\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u533b\u7597\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u91d1\u878d\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u503c\u5f97\u4fe1\u8d56\u548c\u900f\u660e\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u53c8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6e05\u6670\u51b3\u7b56\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u5e76\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\uff08PCA\uff09\u964d\u7ef4\u7684MNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5b50\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u673a\uff08QBM\uff09\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u673a\uff08CBM\uff09\u3002QBM\u91c7\u7528\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u7ea0\u7f20\u5c42\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u7535\u8def\uff0cCBM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u57fa\u7ebf\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6563\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5728QBM\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u56fe\uff0c\u5728CBM\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528SHAP\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "QBM\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eCBM\uff0883.5% vs 54%\uff09\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u503c\u8861\u91cf\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\u8868\u660e\uff0cQBM\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u52a0\u96c6\u4e2d\uff08\u71b5\u503c1.27 vs 1.39\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740QBM\u80fd\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u201c\u6d3b\u6027\u6210\u5206\u201d\u6216\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u539f\u7406\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u7ecf\u5178\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We argue that this failure stems from regularizing local token behavior rather than diversity over sets of solutions. To address this, we propose Uniqueness-Aware Reinforcement Learning, a rollout-level objective that explicitly rewards correct solutions that exhibit rare high-level strategies. Our method uses an LLM-based judge to cluster rollouts for the same problem according to their high-level solution strategies, ignoring superficial variations, and reweights policy advantages inversely with cluster size.

We formalize an ideal notion of universal alignment through test-time scaling: for each prompt, the model produces $k\\ge 1$ candidate responses and a user selects their preferred one. We introduce $(k,f(k))$-robust alignment, which requires the $k$-output model to have win rate $f(k)$ against any other single-output model, and asymptotic universal alignment (U-alignment), which requires $f(k)\\to 1$ as $k\\to\\infty$. Our main result characterizes the optimal convergence rate: there exists a family of single-output policies whose $k$-sample product policies achieve U-alignment at rate $f(k)=\\frac{k}{k+1}$, and no method can achieve a faster rate in general.\n  We show that popular post-training methods, including Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF), can fundamentally underutilize the benefits of test-time scaling. Even though NLHF is optimal for $k=1$, sampling from the resulting (often deterministic) policy cannot guarantee win rates above $\\tfrac{1}{2}$ except for an arbitrarily small slack. This stems from a lack of output diversity: existing alignment methods can collapse to a single majority-preferred response, making additional samples redundant. In contrast, our approach preserves output diversity and achieves the optimal test-time scaling rate. In particular, we propose a family of symmetric multi-player alignment games and prove that any symmetric Nash equilibrium policy of the $(k+1)$-player alignment game achieves the optimal $(k,\\frac{k}{k+1})$-robust alignment. Finally, we provide theoretical convergence guarantees for self-play learning dynamics in these games and extend the framework to opponents that also generate multiple responses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u89c4\u6a21\u8c03\u6574\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u666e\u904d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa(k,f(k))-\u9c81\u68d2\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6e10\u8fd1\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u9f50\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5177\u6709\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u504f\u597d\u7684\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u662f\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982NLHF\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u89c4\u6a21\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165(k,f(k))-\u9c81\u68d2\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6e10\u8fd1\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u79f0\u591a\u73a9\u5bb6\u5bf9\u9f50\u535a\u5f08\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e(k+1)-\u73a9\u5bb6\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u5bf9\u79f0\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18(k,k/(k+1))-\u9c81\u68d2\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5b58\u5728\u5355\u8f93\u51fa\u7b56\u7565\u65cf\uff0c\u5176k\u6837\u672c\u4e58\u79ef\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u901f\u7387f(k)=k/(k+1)\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u6536\u655b\u7387\uff1bNLHF\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8d62\u7387\u8d85\u8fc71/2\uff08\u9664\u4efb\u610f\u5fae\u5c0f\u677e\u5f1b\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u591a\u73a9\u5bb6\u5bf9\u9f50\u535a\u5f08\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u89c4\u6a21\u8c03\u6574\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u591a\u6837\u504f\u597d\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In its original form, this algorithm exploits the sorting of the data points by their first principal component to truncate the search for nearby data points, with nearness being defined in terms of the Euclidean distance. Here we extend CLASSIX to other distance metrics, including the Manhattan distance and the Tanimoto distance. Instead of principal components, we use an appropriate norm of the data vectors as the sorting criterion, combined with the triangle inequality for search termination. In the case of Tanimoto distance, a provably sharper intersection inequality is used to further boost the performance of the new algorithm.
