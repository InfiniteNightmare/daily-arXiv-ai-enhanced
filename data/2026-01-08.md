Abstract: As Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols begin to be used in permissioned blockchains for user-facing applications such as payments, it is crucial that they provide low latency. In pursuit of low latency, some recently proposed BFT consensus protocols employ a leaderless optimistic fast path, in which clients broadcast their requests directly to replicas without first serializing requests at a leader, resulting in an end-to-end commit latency of 2 message delays ($2Δ$) during fault-free, synchronous periods. However, such a fast path only works if there is no contention: concurrent contending requests can cause replicas to diverge if they receive conflicting requests in different orders, triggering costly recovery procedures.
  In this work, we present Aspen, a leaderless BFT protocol that achieves a near-optimal latency of $2Δ+ \varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ indicates a short waiting delay. Aspen removes the no-contention condition by utilizing a best-effort sequencing layer based on loosely synchronized clocks and network delay estimates. Aspen requires $n = 3f + 2p + 1$ replicas to cope with up to $f$ Byzantine nodes. The $2p$ extra nodes allow Aspen's fast path to proceed even if up to $p$ replicas diverge due to unpredictable network delays. When its optimistic conditions do not hold, Aspen falls back to PBFT-style protocol, guaranteeing safety and liveness under partial synchrony. In experiments with wide-area distributed replicas, Aspen commits requests in less than 75 ms, a 1.2 to 3.3$\times$ improvement compared to previous protocols, while supporting 19,000 requests per second.

Abstract: Dynamic availability is the ability of a consensus protocol to remain live despite honest participants going offline and later rejoining. A well-known limitation is that dynamically available protocols, on their own, cannot provide strong safety guarantees during network partitions or extended asynchrony. Ebb-and-flow protocols [SP21] address this by combining a dynamically available protocol with a partially synchronous finality protocol that irrevocably finalizes a prefix.
  We present Majorum, an ebb-and-flow construction whose dynamically available component builds on a quorum-based protocol (TOB-SVD). Under optimistic conditions, Majorum finalizes blocks in as few as three slots while requiring only a single voting phase per slot. In particular, when conditions remain favourable, each slot finalizes the next block extending the previously finalized one.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models facilitate edge deployment by decoupling model capacity from active computation, yet their large memory footprint drives the need for GPU systems with near-data processing (NDP) capabilities that offload experts to dedicated processing units. However, deploying MoE models on such edge-based GPU-NDP systems faces three critical challenges: 1) severe load imbalance across NDP units due to non-uniform expert selection and expert parallelism, 2) insufficient GPU utilization during expert computation within NDP units, and 3) extensive data pre-profiling necessitated by unpredictable expert activation patterns for pre-fetching. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient inference framework featuring three key optimizations. First, the underexplored tensor parallelism in MoE inference is exploited to partition and compute large expert parameters across multiple NDP units simultaneously towards edge low-batch scenarios. Second, a load-balancing-aware scheduling algorithm distributes expert computations across NDP units and GPU to maximize resource utilization. Third, a dataset-free pre-fetching strategy proactively loads frequently accessed experts to minimize activation delays. Experimental results show that our framework enables GPU-NDP systems to achieve 2.41x on average and up to 2.56x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to state-of-the-art approaches, significantly enhancing MoE inference efficiency in resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Existing GPU-sharing techniques, including spatial and temporal sharing, aim to improve utilization but face challenges in simultaneously ensuring SLO adherence and maximizing efficiency due to the lack of fine-grained task scheduling on closed-source GPUs. This paper presents Hummingbird, an SLO-oriented GPU scheduling system that overcomes these challenges by enabling microsecond-scale preemption on closed-source GPUs while effectively harvesting idle GPU time slices. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse GPU architectures reveal that Hummingbird improves the SLO attainment of high-priority tasks by 9.7x and 3.5x compared to the state-of-the-art spatial and temporal-sharing approaches. When compared to executing exclusively, the SLO attainment of the high-priority task, collocating with low-priority tasks on Hummingbird, only drops by less than 1%. Meanwhile, the throughput of the low-priority task outperforms the state-of-the-art temporal-sharing approaches by 2.4x. Hummingbird demonstrates significant effectiveness in ensuring the SLO while enhancing GPU utilization.

Abstract: Deploying microservice-based applications (MSAs) on heterogeneous and dynamic Cloud-Edge infrastructures requires balancing conflicting objectives, such as failure resilience, performance, and environmental sustainability. In this article, we introduce the FREEDA toolchain, designed to automate the failure-resilient and carbon-efficient deployment of MSAs over the Cloud-Edge Continuum.
  The FREEDA toolchain continuously adapts deployment configurations to changing operational conditions, resource availability, and sustainability constraints, aiming to maintain the MSA quality and service continuity while reducing carbon emissions. We also introduce an experimental suite using diverse simulated and emulated scenarios to validate the effectiveness of the toolchain against real-world challenges, including resource exhaustion, node failures, and carbon intensity fluctuations. The results demonstrate FREEDA's capability to autonomously reconfigure deployments by migrating services, adjusting flavour selections, or rebalancing workloads, successfully achieving an optimal balance among resilience, efficiency, and environmental impact.

Conclusion: Pneuma-Seeker通过语言模型驱动的迭代交互系统，成功解决了模糊意图下的数据发现与准备问题，为半自动化数据工作流提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Data discovery and preparation remain persistent bottlenecks in the data management lifecycle, especially when user intent is vague, evolving, or difficult to operationalize. The Pneuma Project introduces Pneuma-Seeker, a system that helps users articulate and fulfill information needs through iterative interaction with a language model-powered platform. The system reifies the user's evolving information need as a relational data model and incrementally converges toward a usable document aligned with that intent. To achieve this, the system combines three architectural ideas: context specialization to reduce LLM burden across subtasks, a conductor-style planner to assemble dynamic execution plans, and a convergence mechanism based on shared state. The system integrates recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), agentic frameworks, and structured data preparation to support semi-automatic, language-guided workflows. We evaluate the system through LLM-based user simulations and show that it helps surface latent intent, guide discovery, and produce fit-for-purpose documents. It also acts as an emergent documentation layer, capturing institutional knowledge and supporting organizational memory.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to evolve solutions to problems in many domains, in a process inspired by biological evolution. However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called "Red Queen" dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives. Our work positions Core War as a rich, controllable sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation in artificial systems and for evaluating LLM-based evolution methods. More broadly, the simplicity and effectiveness of DRQ suggest that similarly minimal self-play approaches could prove useful in other more practical multi-agent adversarial domains, like real-world cybersecurity or combating drug resistance.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）经常生成内容相关但不符合形式约束的输出，产生概念正确但程序错误的响应。传统提示优化方法主要关注重述LLMs需要执行的主要任务描述，忽略了作为响应验收标准的细粒度约束条件。

Method: 提出一种新颖的多智能体工作流，将主任务描述的优化与其约束条件解耦。该方法使用量化分数作为反馈，迭代重写和改进提示，通过分工合作的方式分别优化任务描述和约束条件。

Result: 评估显示该方法生成的修订提示显著提高了Llama 3.1 8B和Mixtral-8x 7B等模型的合规分数，证明其在增强LLM输出合规性方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过分离任务描述优化和约束条件优化，并利用量化反馈的多智能体工作流，可以有效提升大型语言模型对形式约束的遵守能力，解决概念正确但程序错误的输出问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate substantively relevant content but fail to adhere to formal constraints, leading to outputs that are conceptually correct but procedurally flawed. Traditional prompt refinement approaches focus on rephrasing the description of the primary task an LLM has to perform, neglecting the granular constraints that function as acceptance criteria for its response. We propose a novel multi-agentic workflow that decouples optimization of the primary task description from its constraints, using quantitative scores as feedback to iteratively rewrite and improve them. Our evaluation demonstrates this method produces revised prompts that yield significantly higher compliance scores from models like Llama 3.1 8B and Mixtral-8x 7B.

Abstract: Understanding how artificial agents model internal mental states is central to advancing Theory of Mind in AI. Evidence points to a unified system for self- and other-awareness. We explore this self-awareness by having reinforcement learning agents infer their own internal states in gridworld environments. Specifically, we introduce an introspective exploration component that is inspired by biological pain as a learning signal by utilizing a hidden Markov model to infer "pain-belief" from online observations. This signal is integrated into a subjective reward function to study how self-awareness affects the agent's learning abilities. Further, we use this computational framework to investigate the difference in performance between normal and chronic pain perception models. Results show that introspective agents in general significantly outperform standard baseline agents and can replicate complex human-like behaviors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然临床实践指南提供循证建议，但传统方法难以有效整合到AI中，存在可解释性差、指南依从性不一致、领域适用性窄等问题。

Method: 开发了CPGPrompt自动提示系统，将叙述性临床指南转换为结构化决策树，利用大型语言模型动态导航决策树进行患者病例评估。使用合成病例（涵盖头痛、腰痛、前列腺癌三个领域）测试不同决策场景，评估从二元转诊决策到多分类路径分配的各类任务。

Result: 二元转诊分类在所有领域表现稳定优异（F1：0.85-1.00）；多分类路径分配表现下降且存在领域差异：头痛（F1：0.47）、腰痛（F1：0.72）、前列腺癌（F1：0.77）；领域性能差异反映了各自指南结构特点。

Conclusion: CPGPrompt有效将临床实践指南整合到AI中，特别是在二元决策任务上表现出色。多分类任务性能受指南结构特征影响，头痛指南面临否定处理挑战，腰痛指南需要时序推理，前列腺癌因存在可量化实验室检测而获得更可靠决策。

Abstract: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide evidence-based recommendations for patient care; however, integrating them into Artificial Intelligence (AI) remains challenging. Previous approaches, such as rule-based systems, face significant limitations, including poor interpretability, inconsistent adherence to guidelines, and narrow domain applicability. To address this, we develop and validate CPGPrompt, an auto-prompting system that converts narrative clinical guidelines into large language models (LLMs).
  Our framework translates CPGs into structured decision trees and utilizes an LLM to dynamically navigate them for patient case evaluation. Synthetic vignettes were generated across three domains (headache, lower back pain, and prostate cancer) and distributed into four categories to test different decision scenarios. System performance was assessed on both binary specialty-referral decisions and fine-grained pathway-classification tasks.
  The binary specialty referral classification achieved consistently strong performance across all domains (F1: 0.85-1.00), with high recall (1.00 $\pm$ 0.00). In contrast, multi-class pathway assignment showed reduced performance, with domain-specific variations: headache (F1: 0.47), lower back pain (F1: 0.72), and prostate cancer (F1: 0.77). Domain-specific performance differences reflected the structure of each guideline. The headache guideline highlighted challenges with negation handling. The lower back pain guideline required temporal reasoning. In contrast, prostate cancer pathways benefited from quantifiable laboratory tests, resulting in more reliable decision-making.

Conclusion: 清晰区分预测与因果、明确处理AI医疗中的矛盾是负责任AI整合的关键。大型基础模型与N-of-1试验互补结合，才能实现真正有效且隐私保护的个性化医疗推荐。

Abstract: Large foundation models (LFMs) transform healthcare AI in prevention, diagnostics, and treatment. However, whether LFMs can provide truly personalized treatment recommendations remains an open question. Recent research has revealed multiple challenges for personalization, including the fundamental generalizability paradox: models achieving high accuracy in one clinical study perform at chance level in others, demonstrating that personalization and external validity exist in tension. This exemplifies broader contradictions in AI-driven healthcare: the privacy-performance paradox, scale-specificity paradox, and the automation-empathy paradox. As another challenge, the degree of causal understanding required for personalized recommendations, as opposed to mere predictive capacities of LFMs, remains an open question. N-of-1 trials -- crossover self-experiments and the gold standard for individual causal inference in personalized medicine -- resolve these tensions by providing within-person causal evidence while preserving privacy through local experimentation. Despite their impressive capabilities, this paper argues that LFMs cannot replace N-of-1 trials. We argue that LFMs and N-of-1 trials are complementary: LFMs excel at rapid hypothesis generation from population patterns using multimodal data, while N-of-1 trials excel at causal validation for a given individual. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both to enable personalization and navigate the identified paradoxes: LFMs generate ranked intervention candidates with uncertainty estimates, which trigger subsequent N-of-1 trials. Clarifying the boundary between prediction and causation and explicitly addressing the paradoxical tensions are essential for responsible AI integration in personalized medicine.

Abstract: We study continual skill acquisition in open-ended embodied environments where an agent must construct, refine, and reuse an expanding library of executable skills. We introduce the Programmatic Skill Network (PSN), a framework in which skills are executable symbolic programs forming a compositional network that evolves through experience. PSN defines three core mechanisms instantiated via large language models: (1)REFLECT for structured fault localization over skill compositions, (2) progressive optimization with maturity-aware update gating that stabilizes reliable skills while maintaining plasticity for uncertain ones, and (3) canonical structural refactoring under rollback validation that maintains network compactness. We further show that PSN's learning dynamics exhibit structural parallels to neural network training. Experiments on MineDojo and Crafter demonstrate robust skill reuse, rapid adaptation, and strong generalization across open-ended task distributions.\footnote{We plan to open-source the code.

Abstract: Defending against jailbreak attacks is crucial for the safe deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent research has attempted to improve safety by training models to reason over safety rules before responding. However, a key issue lies in determining what form of safety reasoning effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, which is difficult to explicitly design or directly obtain. To address this, we propose \textbf{STAR-S} (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{TA}ught \textbf{R}easoning based on \textbf{S}afety rules), a framework that integrates the learning of safety rule reasoning into a self-taught loop. The core of STAR-S involves eliciting reasoning and reflection guided by safety rules, then leveraging fine-tuning to enhance safety reasoning. Repeating this process creates a synergistic cycle. Improvements in the model's reasoning and interpretation of safety rules allow it to produce better reasoning data under safety rule prompts, which is then utilized for further training. Experiments show that STAR-S effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, outperforming baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/pikepokenew/STAR_S.git.

Motivation: 现有的CoT评估方法存在局限，难以区分性能提升源于真正推理还是单纯文本扩展，需要更精细的分析框架来理解LLM推理过程。

Method: 提出非侵入式的过程导向神经符号评估框架，通过该框架识别四种行为模式，分析推理模式、训练策略和模型规模的影响。

Result: 发现延伸token生成并非深度推理的必要条件；混合长短CoT数据训练会导致过早饱和和坍塌；蒸馏到小模型能复制行为长度但无法重现逻辑效能。

Conclusion: 需要更精细的过程评估方法来理解LLM推理机制，训练策略和模型容量对推理能力有重要影响，单纯扩展文本长度不能保证推理质量。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex reasoning, yet the limitations of current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation obscures whether performance gains stem from genuine reasoning or mere verbosity. To address this, (1) we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework for the non-intrusive, comprehensive process-centric evaluation of reasoning. (2) Through this lens, we identify four distinct behavioral prototypes and diagnose the failure modes. (3) We examine the impact of inference mode, training strategy, and model scale. Our analysis reveals that extended token generation is not a prerequisite for deep reasoning. Furthermore, we reveal critical constraints: mixing long and short CoT data in training risks in premature saturation and collapse, while distillation into smaller models captures behavioral length but fails to replicate logical efficacy due to intrinsic capacity limits.

Abstract: Training reliable tool-augmented agents remains a significant challenge, largely due to the difficulty of credit assignment in multi-step reasoning. While process-level reward models offer a promising direction, existing LLM-based judges often produce noisy and inconsistent signals because they lack fine-grained, task-specific rubrics to distinguish high-level planning from low-level execution. In this work, we introduce SCRIBE (Skill-Conditioned Reward with Intermediate Behavioral Evaluation), a reinforcement learning framework that intervenes at a novel mid-level abstraction. SCRIBE grounds reward modeling in a curated library of skill prototypes, transforming open-ended LLM evaluation into a constrained verification problem. By routing each subgoal to a corresponding prototype, the reward model is equipped with precise, structured rubrics that substantially reduce reward variance.
  Experimental results show that SCRIBE achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of reasoning and tool-use benchmarks. In particular, it improves the AIME25 accuracy of a Qwen3-4B model from 43.3% to 63.3%, and significantly increases success rates in complex multi-turn tool interactions.
  Further analysis of training dynamics reveals a co-evolution across abstraction levels, where mastery of mid-level skills consistently precedes the emergence of effective high-level planning behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate that SCRIBE is additive to low-level tool optimizations, providing a scalable and complementary pathway toward more autonomous and reliable tool-using agents.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit human-like cognitive reasoning strategies (e.g. backtracking, cross-verification) during reasoning process, which improves their performance on complex tasks. Currently, reasoning strategies are autonomously selected by LRMs themselves. However, such autonomous selection often produces inefficient or even erroneous reasoning paths. To make reasoning more reliable and flexible, it is important to develop methods for controlling reasoning strategies. Existing methods struggle to control fine-grained reasoning strategies due to conceptual entanglement in LRMs' hidden states. To address this, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose strategy-entangled hidden states into a disentangled feature space. To identify the few strategy-specific features from the vast pool of SAE features, we propose SAE-Steering, an efficient two-stage feature identification pipeline. SAE-Steering first recalls features that amplify the logits of strategy-specific keywords, filtering out over 99\% of features, and then ranks the remaining features by their control effectiveness. Using the identified strategy-specific features as control vectors, SAE-Steering outperforms existing methods by over 15\% in control effectiveness. Furthermore, controlling reasoning strategies can redirect LRMs from erroneous paths to correct ones, achieving a 7\% absolute accuracy improvement.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve remarkable success through explicit thinking steps, yet the thinking steps introduce a novel risk by potentially amplifying unsafe behaviors. Despite this vulnerability, conventional defense mechanisms remain ineffective as they overlook the unique reasoning dynamics of LRMs. In this work, we find that the emergence of safe-reminding phrases within thinking steps plays a pivotal role in ensuring LRM safety. Motivated by this finding, we propose SafeRemind, a decoding-time defense method that dynamically injects safe-reminding phrases into thinking steps. By leveraging entropy triggers to intervene at decision-locking points, SafeRemind redirects potentially harmful trajectories toward safer outcomes without requiring any parameter updates. Extensive evaluations across five LRMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that SafeRemind substantially enhances safety, achieving improvements of up to 45.5%p while preserving core reasoning utility.

Abstract: Query correction is a critical entry point in modern search pipelines, demanding high accuracy strictly within real-time latency constraints. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves accuracy but incurs prohibitive latency for real-time query correction. A potential solution is to output an answer before reasoning to reduce latency; however, under autoregressive decoding, the early answer is independent of subsequent reasoning, preventing the model from leveraging its reasoning capability to improve accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR), a novel approach that explicitly aligns a fast initial answer with post-hoc reasoning, enabling low-latency query correction without sacrificing reasoning-aware accuracy. SandwichR follows an Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm, producing an initial correction, an explicit reasoning process, and a final refined correction. To align the initial answer with post-reasoning insights, we design a consistency-aware reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: a dedicated consistency reward enforces alignment between the initial and final corrections, while margin-based rejection sampling prioritizes borderline samples where reasoning drives the most impactful corrective gains. Additionally, we construct a high-quality query correction dataset, addressing the lack of specialized benchmarks for complex query correction. Experimental results demonstrate that SandwichR achieves SOTA accuracy comparable to standard CoT while delivering a 40-70% latency reduction, resolving the latency-accuracy trade-off in online search.

TL;DR: 本文针对个性化用药规划中药物数量限制（最多7种）的瓶颈，提出了一种基于领域和问题特定启发式的方法，通过程序化定义领域和LLM生成问题特定启发式，结合GBFS搜索算法，将规划能力扩展至28种药物以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化用药规划需要为个体患者选择药物并确定给药方案以实现特定医疗目标。先前基于通用领域独立启发式的方法最多只能处理7种药物，这在临床实践中是不够的。为了解决这一规模限制问题，需要开发能够处理更多药物的规划方法。

Method: 采用程序化领域定义（指定初始状态和后继生成过程），使用大型语言模型（LLM）生成问题特定的启发式函数，并结合贪心最佳优先搜索（GBFS）算法。这种方法自动生成领域和问题特定的启发式，替代通用的领域独立启发式。

Result: 方法实现了显著的改进：规划覆盖率大幅提高，规划时间明显减少，能够处理至少28种药物的规划问题，显著优于先前最多处理7种药物的限制。

Conclusion: 通过自动生成领域和问题特定启发式，结合通用搜索算法，可以大幅扩展个性化用药规划的规模，将处理药物数量从7种提升到28种以上，使该技术更接近实际临床应用。

Abstract: Personalized medication planning involves selecting medications and determining a dosing schedule to achieve medical goals specific to each individual patient. Previous work successfully demonstrated that automated planners, using general domain-independent heuristics, are able to generate personalized treatments, when the domain and problems are modeled using a general domain description language (\pddlp). Unfortunately, this process was limited in practice to consider no more than seven medications. In clinical terms, this is a non-starter. In this paper, we explore the use of automatically-generated domain- and problem-specific heuristics to be used with general search, as a method of scaling up medication planning to levels allowing closer work with clinicians. Specifically, we specify the domain programmatically (specifying an initial state and a successor generation procedure), and use an LLM to generate a problem specific heuristic that can be used by a fixed search algorithm (GBFS). The results indicate dramatic improvements in coverage and planning time, scaling up the number of medications to at least 28, and bringing medication planning one step closer to practical applications.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly enhanced the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. We find existing fine-tuning datasets frequently suffer from the "answer right but reasoning wrong" probelm, where correct final answers are derived from hallucinated, redundant, or logically invalid intermediate steps. This paper proposes EntroCoT, a unified framework for automatically identifying and refining low-quality CoT supervision traces. EntroCoT first proposes an entropy-based mechanism to segment the reasoning trace into multiple steps at uncertain junctures, and then introduces a Monte Carlo rollout-based mechanism to evaluate the marginal contribution of each step. By accurately filtering deceptive reasoning samples, EntroCoT constructs a high-quality dataset where every intermediate step in each reasoning trace facilitates the final answer. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning on the subset constructed by EntroCoT consistently outperforms the baseslines of full-dataset supervision.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can achieve strong reasoning performance with sufficient computation, but they do not inherently know how much computation a task requires. We study budgeted inference-time reasoning for multiple tasks under a strict global token constraint and formalize it as a Ordered Stochastic Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem(OS-MCKP). This perspective highlights a meta-cognitive requirement -- anticipating task difficulty, estimating return over investment (ROI), and allocating computation strategically. We propose ROI-Reasoning, a two-stage framework that endows LLMs with intrinsic, budget-aware rationality. In the first stage, Meta-Cognitive Fine-Tuning teaches models to predict reasoning cost and expected utility before generation, enabling explicit solve-or-skip decisions. Next, Rationality-Aware Reinforcement Learning optimizes sequential decision making under a hard token budget, allowing models to learn long-horizon allocation strategies. Across budgeted mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ROI-Reasoning consistently improves overall score while substantially reducing regret under tight computation budgets.

Abstract: Defeasible entailment is concerned with drawing plausible conclusions from incomplete information. A foundational framework for modelling defeasible entailment is the KLM framework. Introduced by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor, the KLM framework outlines several key properties for defeasible entailment. One of the most prominent algorithms within this framework is Rational Closure (RC). This paper presents a declarative definition for computing RC using Answer Set Programming (ASP). Our approach enables the automatic construction of the minimal ranked model from a given knowledge base and supports entailment checking for specified queries. We formally prove the correctness of our ASP encoding and conduct empirical evaluations to compare the performance of our implementation with that of existing imperative implementations, specifically the InfOCF solver. The results demonstrate that our ASP-based approach adheres to RC's theoretical foundations and offers improved computational efficiency.

Abstract: We propose an approach to model articles of the Italian Criminal Code (ICC), using Answer Set Programming (ASP), and to semi-automatically learn legal rules from examples based on prior judicial decisions. The developed tool is intended to support legal experts during the criminal trial phase by providing reasoning and possible legal outcomes. The methodology involves analyzing and encoding articles of the ICC in ASP, including "crimes against the person" and property offenses. The resulting model is validated on a set of previous verdicts and refined as necessary. During the encoding process, contradictions may arise; these are properly handled by the system, which also generates possible decisions for new cases and provides explanations through a tool that leverages the "supportedness" of stable models. The automatic explainability offered by the tool can also be used to clarify the logic behind judicial decisions, making the decision-making process more interpretable. Furthermore, the tool integrates an inductive logic programming system for ASP, which is employed to generalize legal rules from case examples.

Abstract: Decision tree models, including random forests and gradient-boosted decision trees, are widely used in machine learning due to their high predictive performance.  However, their complex structures often make them difficult to interpret, especially in safety-critical applications where model decisions require formal justification.  Recent work has demonstrated that logical and abductive explanations can be derived through automated reasoning techniques.  In this paper, we propose a method for generating various types of explanations, namely, sufficient, contrastive, majority, and tree-specific explanations, using Answer Set Programming (ASP).  Compared to SAT-based approaches, our ASP-based method offers greater flexibility in encoding user preferences and supports enumeration of all possible explanations.  We empirically evaluate the approach on a diverse set of datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and limitations compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) has gained significant attention in recent years. Among other things, explainablility for deep neural networks has been a topic of intensive research due to the meteoric rise in prominence of deep neural networks and their "black-box" nature. xAI approaches can be characterized along different dimensions such as their scope (global versus local explanations) or underlying methodologies (statistic-based versus rule-based strategies). Methods generating global explanations aim to provide reasoning process applicable to all possible output classes while local explanation methods focus only on a single, specific class. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a well-known statistical technique, identifies important features of a network. Deep neural network rule extraction method constructs IF-THEN rules that link input conditions to a class. Another approach focuses on generating counterfactuals which help explain how small changes to an input can affect the model's predictions. However, these techniques primarily focus on the input-output relationship and thus neglect the structure of the network in explanation generation.   In this work, we propose xDNN(ASP), an explanation generation system for deep neural networks that provides global explanations. Given a neural network model and its training data, xDNN(ASP) extracts a logic program under answer set semantics that-in the ideal case-represents the trained model, i.e., answer sets of the extracted program correspond one-to-one to input-output pairs of the network. We demonstrate experimentally, using two synthetic datasets, that not only the extracted logic program maintains a high-level of accuracy in the prediction task, but it also provides valuable information for the understanding of the model such as the importance of features as well as the impact of hidden nodes on the prediction. The latter can be used as a guide for reducing the number of nodes used in hidden layers, i.e., providing a means for optimizing the network.

Abstract: Answer set programming (ASP) aims to realize the AI vision: The user specifies the problem, and the computer solves it. Indeed, ASP has made this vision true in many application domains. However, will current ASP solving techniques scale up for large configuration problems? As a benchmark for such problems, we investigated the configuration of electronic systems, which may comprise more than 30,000 components. We show the potential and limits of current ASP technology, focusing on methods that address the so-called grounding bottleneck, i.e., the sharp increase of memory demands in the size of the problem instances. To push the limits, we investigated the incremental solving approach, which proved effective in practice. However, even in the incremental approach, memory demands impose significant limits. Based on an analysis of grounding, we developed the method constraint-aware guessing, which significantly reduced the memory need.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable reasoning in domains like mathematics and coding, where verifiable rewards provide clear signals. However, extending this paradigm to financial decision is challenged by the market's stochastic nature: rewards are verifiable but inherently noisy, causing standard RL to degenerate into reward hacking. To address this, we propose Trade-R1, a model training framework that bridges verifiable rewards to stochastic environments via process-level reasoning verification. Our key innovation is a verification method that transforms the problem of evaluating reasoning over lengthy financial documents into a structured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) task. We construct a triangular consistency metric, assessing pairwise alignment between retrieved evidence, reasoning chains, and decisions to serve as a validity filter for noisy market returns. We explore two reward integration strategies: Fixed-effect Semantic Reward (FSR) for stable alignment signals, and Dynamic-effect Semantic Reward (DSR) for coupled magnitude optimization. Experiments on different country asset selection demonstrate that our paradigm reduces reward hacking, with DSR achieving superior cross-market generalization while maintaining the highest reasoning consistency.

TL;DR: Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT) 用于抑制强化学习优化后大型推理模型在简单问题上过度冗长的问题，通过选择性地在训练时截断冗余token来减少推理开销，同时保持复杂问题的长程推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型通过带可验证奖励的强化学习增强后，性能显著提升，但常因简单问题上的过度冗长（overthinking）导致部署成本高昂。现有依赖显式长度惩罚的高效推理方法常引入优化冲突，且未深入探究导致过度思考的生成机制。为此，本文识别了训练中模型在琐碎输入上越来越生成不必要推理的 '长度偏移 (length shift)' 现象，并提出解决方案。

Method: 1. 提出动态异常截断 (Dynamic Outlier Truncation, DOT)：仅在完全正确的 rollout 组中针对响应长度的极端尾部，选择性地抑制冗余 token，保留处理复杂问题所需的长程推理能力；2. 引入辅助 KL 正则化和预测性动态采样，确保训练稳定收敛。

Result: 在多个模型规模上的实验结果表明，该方法显著扩展了效率-性能的帕累托前沿。特别是在 AIME-24 上，相比初始策略，推理 token 使用量减少 78%，同时准确性提升，且超过现有高效推理方法。

Conclusion: DOT 通过针对性截断训练中产生的冗余推理 token，有效解决了强化学习优化后模型在简单问题上过度冗长的问题，在减少推理开销的同时不损害（甚至提升）准确性，实现了效率与性能的更好权衡。

Abstract: Large reasoning models enhanced by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards have achieved significant performance gains by extending their chain-of-thought. However, this paradigm incurs substantial deployment costs as models often exhibit excessive verbosity on simple queries. Existing efficient reasoning methods relying on explicit length penalties often introduce optimization conflicts and leave the generative mechanisms driving overthinking largely unexamined. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon termed length shift where models increasingly generate unnecessary reasoning on trivial inputs during training. To address this, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT), a training-time intervention that selectively suppresses redundant tokens. This method targets only the extreme tail of response lengths within fully correct rollout groups while preserving long-horizon reasoning capabilities for complex problems. To complement this intervention and ensure stable convergence, we further incorporate auxiliary KL regularization and predictive dynamic sampling. Experimental results across multiple model scales demonstrate that our approach significantly pushes the efficiency-performance Pareto frontier outward. Notably, on the AIME-24, our method reduces inference token usage by 78% while simultaneously increasing accuracy compared to the initial policy and surpassing state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods.

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents have shown strong potential in real-world automation and practical applications. However, most existing agents remain reactive, making decisions mainly from current screen, which limits their performance on long-horizon tasks. Building a world model from repeated interactions enables forecasting action outcomes and supports better decision making for mobile GUI agents. This is challenging because the model must predict post-action states with spatial awareness while remaining efficient enough for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose MobileDreamer, an efficient world-model-based lookahead framework to equip the GUI agents based on the future imagination provided by the world model. It consists of textual sketch world model and rollout imagination for GUI agent. Textual sketch world model forecasts post-action states through a learning process to transform digital images into key task-related sketches, and designs a novel order-invariant learning strategy to preserve the spatial information of GUI elements. The rollout imagination strategy for GUI agent optimizes the action-selection process by leveraging the prediction capability of world model. Experiments on Android World show that MobileDreamer achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves task success by 5.25%. World model evaluations further verify that our textual sketch modeling accurately forecasts key GUI elements.

Abstract: AI-generated content has progressed from monolithic models to modular workflows, especially on platforms like ComfyUI, allowing users to customize complex creative pipelines. However, the large number of components in ComfyUI and the difficulty of maintaining long-horizon structural consistency under strict graph constraints frequently lead to low pass rates and workflows of limited quality. To tackle these limitations, we present ComfySearch, an agentic framework that can effectively explore the component space and generate functional ComfyUI pipelines via validation-guided workflow construction. Experiments demonstrate that ComfySearch substantially outperforms existing methods on complex and creative tasks, achieving higher executability (pass) rates, higher solution rates, and stronger generalization.

Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems have emerged as powerful architectures for complex task decomposition and collaborative problem-solving. However, their long-term behavioral stability remains largely unexamined. This study introduces the concept of agent drift, defined as the progressive degradation of agent behavior, decision quality, and inter-agent coherence over extended interaction sequences. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding drift phenomena, proposing three distinct manifestations: semantic drift (progressive deviation from original intent), coordination drift (breakdown in multi-agent consensus mechanisms), and behavioral drift (emergence of unintended strategies).
  We introduce the Agent Stability Index (ASI), a novel composite metric framework for quantifying drift across twelve dimensions, including response consistency, tool usage patterns, reasoning pathway stability, and inter-agent agreement rates. Through simulation-based analysis and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate how unchecked agent drift can lead to substantial reductions in task completion accuracy and increased human intervention requirements.
  We propose three mitigation strategies: episodic memory consolidation, drift-aware routing protocols, and adaptive behavioral anchoring. Theoretical analysis suggests these approaches can significantly reduce drift-related errors while maintaining system throughput. This work establishes a foundational methodology for monitoring, measuring, and mitigating agent drift in production agentic AI systems, with direct implications for enterprise deployment reliability and AI safety research.

Abstract: Distributed Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) integrated with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has emerged as a prominent research focus, enabling real-time cooperative decision-making in partially observable environments through inter-agent communication. However, due to insufficient collaborative and perceptual capabilities, existing methods are inadequate for scaling across diverse environmental conditions. To address these challenges, we propose PC2P, a novel distributed MAPF method derived from a Q-learning-based MARL framework. Initially, we introduce a personalized-enhanced communication mechanism based on dynamic graph topology, which ascertains the core aspects of ``who" and ``what" in interactive process through three-stage operations: selection, generation, and aggregation. Concurrently, we incorporate local crowd perception to enrich agents' heuristic observation, thereby strengthening the model's guidance for effective actions via the integration of static spatial constraints and dynamic occupancy changes. To resolve extreme deadlock issues, we propose a region-based deadlock-breaking strategy that leverages expert guidance to implement efficient coordination within confined areas. Experimental results demonstrate that PC2P achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art distributed MAPF methods in varied environments. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module for overall performance.

Abstract: This paper formalises the literature on emerging design patterns and paradigms for Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled multi-agent systems (MAS), evaluating their practical utility across various domains. We define key architectural components, including agent orchestration, communication mechanisms, and control-flow strategies, and demonstrate how these enable rapid development of modular, domain-adaptive solutions. Three real-world case studies are tested in controlled, containerised pilots in telecommunications security, national heritage asset management, and utilities customer service automation. Initial empirical results show that, for these case studies, prototypes were delivered within two weeks and pilot-ready solutions within one month, suggesting reduced development overhead compared to conventional approaches and improved user accessibility. However, findings also reinforce limitations documented in the literature, including variability in LLM behaviour that leads to challenges in transitioning from prototype to production maturity. We conclude by outlining critical research directions for improving reliability, scalability, and governance in MAS architectures and the further work needed to mature MAS design patterns to mitigate the inherent challenges.

Abstract: Chromatographic separation technology has been widely applied in pharmaceutical, chemical, and food industries due to its high efficiency. However, traditional human-dependent chromatographic process development faces challenges such as reliance on expert experience, long development cycles, and labor intensity. ChromR, a large language model (LLM)-driven platform for chromatographic process design and optimization, is presented in this work. The platform integrates ChromLLM, a domain-specific LLM trained for chromatography, along with a multi-agent system and an automated chromatographic experimental device. The multi-agent system comprises four agents: domain knowledge answering, experimental design, experimental execution, and data analysis. ChromR enables automatic completion of the entire workflow-including initial process parameter recommendation, experimental design, automated execution, data analysis, and multi-objective optimization. By utilizing ChromR, dependency on expert knowledge is effectively reduced, while labor input and development time are significantly decreased. Chromatographic purification of the extract of Ginkgo biloba leaf (EGBL) was selected as a case study. ChromR successfully developed a chromatographic process within one week that meets multiple objectives, including fraction quality and production efficiency, reducing development time to approximately one-seventh of that required by the conventional paradigm. An intelligent, automated, and universally applicable new paradigm was established for chromatographic process development.

Abstract: LLMs-based agents increasingly operate in multi-agent environments where strategic interaction and coordination are required. While existing work has largely focused on individual agents or on interacting agents sharing explicit communication, less is known about how interacting agents coordinate implicitly. In particular, agents may engage in covert communication, relying on indirect or non-linguistic signals embedded in their actions rather than on explicit messages. This paper presents a game-theoretic study of covert communication in LLM-driven multi-agent systems. We analyse interactions across four canonical game-theoretic settings under different communication regimes, including explicit, restricted, and absent communication. Considering heterogeneous agent personalities and both one-shot and repeated games, we characterise when covert signals emerge and how they shape coordination and strategic outcomes.

Abstract: Agile methods, and Scrum in particular, are widely taught in software engineering education; however, there is limited empirical evidence on how these practices function in long-running, student-led projects under academic and hybrid work constraints. This paper presents a year-long case study of an eight-person student development team tasked with designing and implementing a virtual reality game that simulates a university campus and provides program-related educational content. We analyze how the team adapted Scrum practices (sprint structure, roles, backlog management) to fit semester rhythms, exams, travel, and part-time availability, and how communication and coordination were maintained in a hybrid on-site/remote environment. Using qualitative observations and artifacts from Discord, Notion, and GitHub, as well as contribution metrics and a custom communication effectiveness index (score: 0.76/1.00), we evaluate three dimensions: (1) the effectiveness of collaboration tools, (2) the impact of hybrid work on communication and productivity, and (3) the feasibility of aligning Scrum with academic timelines. Our findings show that (i) lightweight, tool-mediated coordination enabled stable progress even during remote periods; (ii) one-week sprints and flexible ceremonies helped reconcile Scrum with academic obligations; and (iii) shared motivation, role clarity, and compatible working styles were as critical as process mechanics. We propose practical recommendations for instructors and student teams adopting agile methods in hybrid, project-based learning settings.

Abstract: Repository-level code completion benefits from retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, controlling cross-file evidence is difficult because chunk utility is often interaction-dependent: some snippets help only when paired with complementary context, while others harm decoding when they conflict. We propose RepoShapley, a coalition-aware context filtering framework supervised by Shapley-style marginal contributions. Our module ChunkShapley constructs offline labels by (i) single-chunk probing with teacher-forced likelihood to estimate signed, weighted effects, (ii) a surrogate game that captures saturation and interference, (iii) exact Shapley computation for small retrieval sets, and (iv) bounded post-verification that selects a decoding-optimal coalition using the frozen generator. We distill verified $KEEP$ or $DROP$ decisions and retrieval triggering into a single model via discrete control tokens. Experiments across benchmarks and backbones show that RepoShapley improves completion quality while reducing harmful context and unnecessary retrieval.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了开源软件（OSS）与社会公益开源软件（OSS4SG）在社区结构、贡献者参与度和编码实践方面的差异，发现OSS4SG项目社区更稳定、贡献更持续，而常规OSS项目更具吸引力但周转率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统开源软件研究已较为充分，但针对以社会公益为使命的开源软件（OSS4SG）的发展实践知之甚少。理解这类项目的社区动态和贡献者模式对确保其可持续性和长期影响力至关重要。

Method: 对1039个GitHub仓库进行大规模实证研究，包括422个OSS4SG项目和617个常规OSS项目，比较社区结构、贡献者参与度和编码实践。

Result: OSS4SG项目形成了更稳定（63.4%）的社区，而常规OSS项目更具吸引力（75.4%）；OSS4SG项目的贡献活动全年稳定，常规OSS项目则呈现季节性波动；OSS4SG项目依赖核心贡献者保障代码质量和问题解决，而常规OSS项目主要依靠核心贡献者保证代码质量，通过临时贡献者解决问题。

Conclusion: OSS4SG项目的使命驱动特性显著影响其社区结构和开发实践，表现为更稳定的贡献者群体和持续的参与度，这对于此类项目的长期可持续发展具有重要启示意义。

Abstract: Open Source Software for Social Good (OSS4SG) projects aim to address critical societal challenges, such as healthcare access and community safety. Understanding the community dynamics and contributor patterns in these projects is essential for ensuring their sustainability and long-term impact. However, while extensive research has focused on conventional Open Source Software (OSS), little is known about how the mission-driven nature of OSS4SG influences its development practices. To address this gap, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of 1,039 GitHub repositories, comprising 422 OSS4SG and 617 conventional OSS projects, to compare community structure, contributor engagement, and coding practices. Our findings reveal that OSS4SG projects foster significantly more stable and "sticky" (63.4%) communities, whereas conventional OSS projects are more "magnetic" (75.4%), attracting a high turnover of contributors. OSS4SG projects also demonstrate consistent engagement throughout the year, while conventional OSS communities exhibit seasonal fluctuations. Additionally, OSS4SG projects rely heavily on core contributors for both code quality and issue resolution, while conventional OSS projects leverage casual contributors for issue resolution, with core contributors focusing primarily on code quality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly assessed based on their common sense reasoning, language comprehension, and logical reasoning abilities. While models trained in specialized domains like mathematics or coding have demonstrated remarkable advancements in logical reasoning, there remains a significant gap in evaluating their code generation capabilities. Existing benchmark datasets fall short in pinpointing specific strengths and weaknesses, impeding targeted enhancements in models' reasoning abilities to synthesize code. To bridge this gap, our paper introduces an innovative, pedagogical benchmarking method that mirrors the evaluation processes encountered in academic programming courses. We introduce CodeEval, a multi-dimensional benchmark dataset designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs across 24 distinct aspects of Python programming. The dataset covers three proficiency levels - beginner, intermediate, and advanced - and includes both class-based and function-based problem types with detailed problem specifications and comprehensive test suites. To facilitate widespread adoption, we also developed RunCodeEval, an open-source execution framework that provides researchers with a ready-to-use evaluation pipeline for CodeEval. RunCodeEval handles test execution, context setup, and metrics generation, enabling researchers to quickly obtain detailed insights into model strengths and weaknesses across complexity levels, problem types, and programming categories. This combination enables targeted evaluation and guides improvements in LLMs' programming proficiencies.

TL;DR: BootTrans: 基于测试套件功能不变性的自举方法，利用轴心语言单元测试作为多语言强化学习的通用验证机制，通过双池架构渐进扩展训练数据，并结合语言感知加权解决优化不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言程序代码翻译面临两个关键挑战：1) 并行数据稀缺且缺乏可执行测试预言；2) 处理不同语言对时存在优化不平衡问题。现有方法难以同时解决这些障碍。

Method: BootTrans的核心思想是利用测试套件的功能不变性和跨语言可移植性，将丰富的轴心语言单元测试适配为多语言强化学习的通用验证预言。采用双池架构（种子池和探索池）通过执行引导的经验收集渐进扩展训练数据。设计语言感知加权机制，根据兄弟语言间的相对性能动态优先处理更难的翻译方向。

Result: 在HumanEval-X和TransCoder-Test基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在所有翻译方向上均显著优于基线大语言模型。消融实验验证了自举和加权组件的有效性。

Conclusion: BootTrans通过测试套件的功能不变性和创新的双池自举架构，有效解决了多语言代码翻译中的数据稀缺和优化不平衡问题，为跨语言程序翻译提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Code translation across multiple programming languages is essential yet challenging due to two vital obstacles: scarcity of parallel data paired with executable test oracles, and optimization imbalance when handling diverse language pairs. We propose BootTrans, a bootstrapping method that resolves both obstacles. Its key idea is to leverage the functional invariance and cross-lingual portability of test suites, adapting abundant pivot-language unit tests to serve as universal verification oracles for multilingual RL training. Our method introduces a dual-pool architecture with seed and exploration pools to progressively expand training data via execution-guided experience collection. Furthermore, we design a language-aware weighting mechanism that dynamically prioritizes harder translation directions based on relative performance across sibling languages, mitigating optimization imbalance. Extensive experiments on the HumanEval-X and TransCoder-Test benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline LLMs across all translation directions, with ablations validating the effectiveness of both bootstrapping and weighting components.

Abstract: Open-source scientific software is abundant, yet most tools remain difficult to compile, configure, and reuse, sustaining a small-workshop mode of scientific computing. This deployment bottleneck limits reproducibility, large-scale evaluation, and the practical integration of scientific tools into modern AI-for-Science (AI4S) and agentic workflows.
  We present Deploy-Master, a one-stop agentic workflow for large-scale tool discovery, build specification inference, execution-based validation, and publication. Guided by a taxonomy spanning 90+ scientific and engineering domains, our discovery stage starts from a recall-oriented pool of over 500,000 public repositories and progressively filters it to 52,550 executable tool candidates under license- and quality-aware criteria. Deploy-Master transforms heterogeneous open-source repositories into runnable, containerized capabilities grounded in execution rather than documentation claims. In a single day, we performed 52,550 build attempts and constructed reproducible runtime environments for 50,112 scientific tools. Each successful tool is validated by a minimal executable command and registered in SciencePedia for search and reuse, enabling direct human use and optional agent-based invocation.
  Beyond delivering runnable tools, we report a deployment trace at the scale of 50,000 tools, characterizing throughput, cost profiles, failure surfaces, and specification uncertainty that become visible only at scale. These results explain why scientific software remains difficult to operationalize and motivate shared, observable execution substrates as a foundation for scalable AI4S and agentic science.

Motivation: 随着AI代码助手越来越多地提交PR，有必要理解测试在这些AI驱动的工作流程中的表现。通过实证研究，可以揭示AI PR中的测试行为规律。

Method: 使用AIDev数据集，对AI驱动的PR进行实证研究。分析测试的包含频率、在PR生命周期中的引入时机，并比较含测试与不含测试PR在规模、周转时间和合并结果等方面的差异。

Result: 研究发现：1）包含测试的PR随时间推移变得更加常见；2）含测试的PR往往规模更大、完成时间更长；3）合并率基本相似；4）不同AI助手在测试采纳率以及测试代码与生产代码的平衡上存在差异。

Conclusion: 该研究为AI驱动PR中的测试行为提供了描述性视图，为未来自主软件开发研究提供了实证基础。研究揭示了AI助手在测试实践上的表现特征及其差异。

Abstract: Testing is a critical practice for ensuring software correctness and long-term maintainability. As agentic coding tools increasingly submit pull requests (PRs), it becomes essential to understand how testing appears in these agent-driven workflows. Using the AIDev dataset, we present an empirical study of test inclusion in agentic pull requests. We examine how often tests are included, when they are introduced during the PR lifecycle and how test-containing PRs differ from non-test PRs in terms of size, turnaround time, and merge outcomes. Across agents, test-containing PRs are more common over time and tend to be larger and take longer to complete, while merge rates remain largely similar. We also observe variation across agents in both test adoption and the balance between test and production code within test PRs. Our findings provide a descriptive view of testing behavior in agentic pull requests and offer empirical grounding for future studies of autonomous software development.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly deployed to make critical decisions in socioeconomic applications such as finance, criminal justice, and autonomous driving. However, due to their data-driven and pattern-seeking nature, ML algorithms may develop decision logic that disproportionately distributes opportunities, benefits, resources, or information among different population groups, potentially harming marginalized communities. In response to such fairness concerns, the software engineering and ML communities have made significant efforts to establish the best practices for creating fair ML software. These include fairness interventions for training ML models, such as including sensitive features, selecting non-sensitive attributes, and applying bias mitigators. But how reliably can software professionals tasked with developing data-driven systems depend on these recommendations? And how well do these practices generalize in the presence of faulty labels, missing data, or distribution shifts? These questions form the core theme of this paper.

TL;DR: 该基准测试旨在评估LLM在代码生成中数据完整性的可靠性，要求模型将高精度十进制常量逐字嵌入Python代码并进行简单聚合计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多软件任务需要对数据进行精确转录（如加密常数、协议测试向量等），这些操作对微小错误敏感但可能不显式报错。现有代码生成评估主要关注算法推理，缺乏对数据完整性可靠性的专门测试。

Method: 设计最小化转录到代码基准测试：模型接收高精度十进制常量列表，必须生成嵌入常量并执行简单聚合计算的Python代码。采用基于精确字符串包含的评估协议，分析状态跟踪和长程生成失败。

Result: 该基准作为紧凑的压力测试，聚焦数据完整性而非算法推理，补充现有代码生成评估。

Conclusion: 提出的转录基准为LLM代码生成提供专门的数据完整性可靠性评估工具，可识别状态跟踪和长程生成中的模型失败模式。

Abstract: Many real-world software tasks require exact transcription of provided data into code, such as cryptographic constants, protocol test vectors, allowlists, and calibration tables. These tasks are operationally sensitive because small omissions or alterations can remain silent while producing syntactically valid programs. This paper introduces a deliberately minimal transcription-to-code benchmark to isolate this reliability concern in LLM-based code generation. Given a list of high-precision decimal constants, a model must generate Python code that embeds the constants verbatim and performs a simple aggregate computation. We describe the prompting variants, evaluation protocol based on exact-string inclusion, and analysis framework used to characterize state-tracking and long-horizon generation failures. The benchmark is intended as a compact stress test that complements existing code-generation evaluations by focusing on data integrity rather than algorithmic reasoning.

TL;DR: RepoReason：一个基于溯因断言验证的白盒诊断基准，通过执行驱动变异框架消除记忆，并使用动态程序切片量化推理能力的三维指标（ESV、MCL、DFI）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型发展成为自主智能体，评估其在真实、大规模、相互依赖的文件系统中的仓库级推理能力（即维持跨文件逻辑一致性的能力）变得至关重要。现有基准通常在孤立的代码片段与黑盒评估之间徘徊，缺乏对推理过程的深度诊断。

Method: 提出了RepoReason基准，核心是溯因（abductive）断言验证。方法包括：（1）实施执行驱动的变异框架，利用环境作为语义预言机，重新生成真实的状态，以消除记忆效应，同时保持真实的逻辑深度；（2）建立基于动态程序切片的细粒度诊断系统，通过三个正交指标量化推理能力：ESV（阅读负载）、MCL（模拟深度，或称最具体执行链长度）、DFI（集成宽度，或称跨文件接口依赖深度）。

Result: 对前沿模型（如Claude-4.5-Sonnet、DeepSeek-v3.1-Terminus）的综合评估揭示，普遍存在集成宽度障碍（aggregation deficit），即跨文件接口依赖的集成能力是主要的认知瓶颈。模型在大规模、多个文件相互依赖的场景下，维持一致逻辑推理的宽度不足。

Conclusion: RepoReason提供了细粒度的白盒洞察，有助于优化下一代智能软件工程系统。它明确了评估和改善模型仓库级跨文件推理能力的关键挑战——集成宽度。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve into autonomous agents, evaluating repository-level reasoning, the ability to maintain logical consistency across massive, real-world, interdependent file systems, has become critical. Current benchmarks typically fluctuate between isolated code snippets and black-box evaluations. We present RepoReason, a white-box diagnostic benchmark centered on abductive assertion verification. To eliminate memorization while preserving authentic logical depth, we implement an execution-driven mutation framework that utilizes the environment as a semantic oracle to regenerate ground-truth states. Furthermore, we establish a fine-grained diagnostic system using dynamic program slicing, quantifying reasoning via three orthogonal metrics: $ESV$ (reading load), $MCL$ (simulation depth), and $DFI$ (integration width). Comprehensive evaluations of frontier models (e.g., Claude-4.5-Sonnet, DeepSeek-v3.1-Terminus) reveal a prevalent aggregation deficit, where integration width serves as the primary cognitive bottleneck. Our findings provide granular white-box insights for optimizing the next generation of agentic software engineering.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude and LLaMA have shown impressive performance in code generation, typically evaluated using benchmarks (e.g., HumanEval). However, effective code generation requires models to understand and apply a wide range of language concepts. If the concepts exercised in benchmarks are not representative of those used in real-world projects, evaluations may yield incomplete. Despite this concern, the representativeness of code concepts in benchmarks has not been systematically examined.
  To address this gap, we present the first empirical study that analyzes the representativeness of code generation benchmarks through the lens of Knowledge Units (KUs) - cohesive sets of programming language capabilities provided by language constructs and APIs. We analyze KU coverage in two widely used Python benchmarks, HumanEval and MBPP, and compare them with 30 real-world Python projects. Our results show that each benchmark covers only half of the identified 20 KUs, whereas projects exercise all KUs with relatively balanced distributions. In contrast, benchmark tasks exhibit highly skewed KU distributions.
  To mitigate this misalignment, we propose a prompt-based LLM framework that synthesizes KU-based tasks to rebalance benchmark KU distributions and better align them with real-world usage. Using this framework, we generate 440 new tasks and augment existing benchmarks. The augmented benchmarks substantially improve KU coverage and achieve over a 60% improvement in distributional alignment. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on these augmented benchmarks reveal consistent and statistically significant performance drops (12.54-44.82%), indicating that existing benchmarks overestimate LLM performance due to their limited KU coverage. Our findings provide actionable guidance for building more realistic evaluations of LLM code-generation capabilities.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used to boost productivity and support software engineering tasks. However, when applied to socially sensitive decisions such as team composition and task allocation, they raise concerns of fairness. Prior studies have revealed that LLMs may reproduce stereotypes; however, these analyses remain exploratory and examine sensitive attributes in isolation. This study investigates whether LLMs exhibit bias in team composition and task assignment by analyzing the combined effects of candidates' country and pronouns. Using three LLMs and 3,000 simulated decisions, we find systematic disparities: demographic attributes significantly shaped both selection likelihood and task allocation, even when accounting for expertise-related factors. Task distributions further reflected stereotypes, with technical and leadership roles unevenly assigned across groups. Our findings indicate that LLMs exacerbate demographic inequities in software engineering contexts, underscoring the need for fairness-aware assessment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software development workflows, yet their behavior in structured, specification-driven processes remains poorly understood. This paper presents an empirical study design using CURRANTE, a Visual Studio Code extension that enables a human-in-the-loop workflow for LLM-assisted code generation. The tool guides developers through three sequential stages--Specification, Tests, and Function--allowing them to define requirements, generate and refine test suites, and produce functions that satisfy those tests. Participants will solve medium-difficulty problems from the LiveCodeBench dataset, while the tool records fine-grained interaction logs, effectiveness metrics (e.g., pass rate, all-pass completion), efficiency indicators (e.g., time-to-pass), and iteration behaviors. The study aims to analyze how human intervention in specification and test refinement influences the quality and dynamics of LLM-generated code. The results will provide empirical insights into the design of next-generation development environments that align human reasoning with model-driven code generation.

Abstract: Background: Extracting the stages that structure Machine Learning (ML) pipelines from source code is key for gaining a deeper understanding of data science practices. However, the diversity caused by the constant evolution of the ML ecosystem (e.g., algorithms, libraries, datasets) makes this task challenging. Existing approaches either depend on non-scalable, manual labeling, or on ML classifiers that do not properly support the diversity of the domain. These limitations highlight the need for more flexible and reliable solutions.
  Objective: We evaluate whether Small Language Models (SLMs) can leverage their code understanding and classification abilities to address these limitations, and subsequently how they can advance our understanding of data science practices.
  Method: We conduct a confirmatory study based on two reference works selected for their relevance regarding current state-of-the-art's limitations. First, we compare several SLMs using Cochran's Q test. The best-performing model is then evaluated against the reference studies using two distinct McNemar's tests. We further analyze how variations in taxonomy definitions affect performance through an additional Cochran's Q test. Finally, a goodness-of-fit analysis is conducted using Pearson's chi-squared tests to compare our insights on data science practices with those from prior studies.

Abstract: Issue Tracking Systems (ITSs) enable software developers and managers to collect and resolve issues collaboratively. While researchers have extensively analysed ITS data to automate or assist specific activities such as issue assignments, duplicate detection, or priority prediction, developer studies on ITSs remain rare. Particularly, little is known about the challenges Software Engineering (SE) teams encounter in ITSs and when certain practices and workarounds (such as leaving issue fields like "priority" empty) are considered problematic. To fill this gap, we conducted an in-depth interview study with 26 experienced SE practitioners from different organisations and industries. We asked them about general problems encountered, as well as the relevance of 31 ITS smells (aka potentially problematic practices) discussed in the literature. By applying Thematic Analysis to the interview notes, we identified 14 common problems including issue findability, zombie issues, workflow bloat, and lack of workflow enforcement. Participants also stated that many of the ITS smells do not occur or are not problematic. Our results suggest that ITS problems and smells are highly dependent on context factors such as ITS configuration, workflow stage, and team size. We also discuss potential tooling solutions to configure, monitor, and visualise ITS smells to cope with these challenges.

Result: 现代轻量级Transformer可达到原始模型75-96%的准确性，模型大小减小4-10倍，推理延迟降低3-9倍，内存带宽分析显示15-40M参数模型达到最佳硬件利用率。

Abstract: The deployment of transformer-based models on resource-constrained edge devices represents a critical challenge in enabling real-time artificial intelligence applications. This comprehensive survey examines lightweight transformer architectures specifically designed for edge deployment, analyzing recent advances in model compression, quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation techniques. We systematically review prominent lightweight variants including MobileBERT, TinyBERT, DistilBERT, EfficientFormer, EdgeFormer, and MobileViT, providing detailed performance benchmarks on standard datasets such as GLUE, SQuAD, ImageNet-1K, and COCO. Our analysis encompasses current industry adoption patterns across major hardware platforms (NVIDIA Jetson, Qualcomm Snapdragon, Apple Neural Engine, ARM architectures), deployment frameworks (TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, PyTorch Mobile, CoreML), and optimization strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that modern lightweight transformers can achieve 75-96% of full-model accuracy while reducing model size by 4-10x and inference latency by 3-9x, enabling deployment on devices with as little as 2-5W power consumption. We identify sparse attention mechanisms, mixed-precision quantization (INT8/FP16), and hardware-aware neural architecture search as the most effective optimization strategies. Novel findings include memory-bandwidth bottleneck analysis revealing 15-40M parameter models achieve optimal hardware utilization (60-75% efficiency), quantization sweet spots for different model types, and comprehensive energy efficiency profiling across edge platforms. We establish real-time performance boundaries and provide a practical 6-step deployment pipeline achieving 8-12x size reduction with less than 2% accuracy degradation.

Abstract: This study highlights the potential of image-based reinforcement learning methods for addressing swarm-related tasks. In multi-agent reinforcement learning, effective policy learning depends on how agents sense, interpret, and process inputs. Traditional approaches often rely on handcrafted feature extraction or raw vector-based representations, which limit the scalability and efficiency of learned policies concerning input order and size. In this work we propose an image-based reinforcement learning method for decentralized control of a multi-agent system, where observations are encoded as structured visual inputs that can be processed by Neural Networks, extracting its spatial features and producing novel decentralized motion control rules. We evaluate our approach on a multi-agent convergence task of agents with limited-range and bearing-only sensing that aim to keep the swarm cohesive during the aggregation. The algorithm's performance is evaluated against two benchmarks: an analytical solution proposed by Bellaiche and Bruckstein, which ensures convergence but progresses slowly, and VariAntNet, a neural network-based framework that converges much faster but shows medium success rates in hard constellations. Our method achieves high convergence, with a pace nearly matching that of VariAntNet. In some scenarios, it serves as the only practical alternative.

TL;DR: 提出 R²VPO，一种新颖的原对偶策略优化方法，针对现有基于剪裁的算法进行改进


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于剪裁的策略优化方法（如PPO、GRPO）存在两个核心问题：1）硬性剪裁会抑制高回报但高差异的“尤里卡时刻”梯度信号；2）一旦数据稍微过时就完全失效，导致样本效率低下

Method: 提出了R²VPO（Ratio-Variance Regularized Policy Optimization）方法，通过约束策略比率的方差（二阶中心矩）作为硬性剪裁的原则性平滑松弛，同时支持稳定的在线学习和通过动态重新加权实现原则性的离线数据重用

Result: 在DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B和openPangu-Embedded系列（1B和7B）的大语言模型微调实验中，R²VPO在数学推理基准测试上实现了最高17%的相对性能提升，同时达到收敛所需的经验样本减少约50%

Conclusion: 比率方差控制是提升基于强化学习的LLM对齐任务稳定性和数据效率的可行方向

Abstract: On-policy reinforcement learning (RL), particularly Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has become the dominant paradigm for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). While policy ratio clipping stabilizes training, this heuristic hard constraint incurs a fundamental cost: it indiscriminately truncates gradients from high-return yet high-divergence actions, suppressing rare but highly informative "eureka moments" in complex reasoning. Moreover, once data becomes slightly stale, hard clipping renders it unusable, leading to severe sample inefficiency. In this work, we revisit the trust-region objective in policy optimization and show that explicitly constraining the \emph{variance (second central moment) of the policy ratio} provides a principled and smooth relaxation of hard clipping. This distributional constraint stabilizes policy updates while preserving gradient signals from valuable trajectories. Building on this insight, we propose $R^2VPO$ (Ratio-Variance Regularized Policy Optimization), a novel primal-dual framework that supports stable on-policy learning and enables principled off-policy data reuse by dynamically reweighting stale samples rather than discarding them. We extensively evaluate $R^2VPO$ on fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and the openPangu-Embedded series (1B and 7B), across challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results show that $R^2VPO$ consistently achieves superior asymptotic performance, with average relative gains of up to 17% over strong clipping-based baselines, while requiring approximately 50% fewer rollouts to reach convergence. These findings establish ratio-variance control as a promising direction for improving both stability and data efficiency in RL-based LLM alignment.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for radiology report generation, yet their clinical translation is hindered by architectural heterogeneity and the prevalence of factual hallucinations. Standard supervised fine-tuning often fails to strictly align linguistic outputs with visual evidence, while existing reinforcement learning approaches struggle with either prohibitive computational costs or limited exploration. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework for self-consistent radiology report generation. First, we conduct a systematic evaluation to identify optimal vision encoder and LLM backbone configurations for medical imaging. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel "Reason-then-Summarize" architecture optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This framework restructures generation into two distinct components: a think block for detailed findings and an answer block for structured disease labels. By utilizing a multi-dimensional composite reward function, we explicitly penalize logical discrepancies between the generated narrative and the final diagnosis. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-CXR benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in clinical efficacy metrics and significantly reduces hallucinations compared to strong supervised baselines.

Abstract: Wildfires are highly imbalanced natural hazards in both space and severity, making the prediction of extreme events particularly challenging. In this work, we introduce the first ordinal classification framework for forecasting wildfire severity levels directly aligned with operational decision-making in France. Our study investigates the influence of loss-function design on the ability of neural models to predict rare yet critical high-severity fire occurrences. We compare standard cross-entropy with several ordinal-aware objectives, including the proposed probabilistic TDeGPD loss derived from a truncated discrete exponentiated Generalized Pareto Distribution. Through extensive benchmarking over multiple architectures and real operational data, we show that ordinal supervision substantially improves model performance over conventional approaches. In particular, the Weighted Kappa Loss (WKLoss) achieves the best overall results, with more than +0.1 IoU gain on the most extreme severity classes while maintaining competitive calibration quality. However, performance remains limited for the rarest events due to their extremely low representation in the dataset. These findings highlight the importance of integrating both severity ordering, data imbalance considerations, and seasonality risk into wildfire forecasting systems. Future work will focus on incorporating seasonal dynamics and uncertainty information into training to further improve the reliability of extreme-event prediction.

Conclusion: 本地梯度动态可作为稳定异构联邦学习系统的关键调控杠杆，提出的ECGR方法在不增加通信开销的情况下有效提升了系统稳定性

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, yet its stability is fundamentally challenged by statistical heterogeneity in realistic deployments. Here, we show that client heterogeneity destabilizes FL primarily by distorting local gradient dynamics during client-side optimization, causing systematic drift that accumulates across communication rounds and impedes global convergence. This observation highlights local gradients as a key regulatory lever for stabilizing heterogeneous FL systems. Building on this insight, we develop a general client-side perspective that regulates local gradient contributions without incurring additional communication overhead. Inspired by swarm intelligence, we instantiate this perspective through Exploratory--Convergent Gradient Re-aggregation (ECGR), which balances well-aligned and misaligned gradient components to preserve informative updates while suppressing destabilizing effects. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, including evaluations on the LC25000 medical imaging dataset, demonstrate that regulating local gradient dynamics consistently stabilizes federated learning across state-of-the-art methods under heterogeneous data distributions.

Abstract: Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KAN) replace scalar weights by learnable univariate functions, often implemented with B-splines. This design can be accurate and interpretable, but it makes inference expensive on CPU because each layer requires many spline evaluations. Standard quantization toolchains are also hard to apply because the main computation is not a matrix multiply but repeated spline basis evaluation. This paper introduces LUT-KAN, a segment-wise lookup-table (LUT) compilation and quantization method for PyKAN-style KAN layers. LUT-KAN converts each edge function into a per-segment LUT with affine int8/uint8 quantization and linear interpolation. The method provides an explicit and reproducible inference contract, including boundary conventions and out-of-bounds (OOB) policies. We propose an ``honest baseline'' methodology for speed evaluation: B-spline evaluation and LUT evaluation are compared under the same backend optimization (NumPy vs NumPy and Numba vs Numba), which separates representation gains from vectorization and JIT effects. Experiments include controlled sweeps over LUT resolution L in 16, 32, 64, 128 and two quantization schemes (symmetric int8 and asymmetric uint8). We report accuracy, speed, and memory metrics with mean and standard deviation across multiple seeds. A two-by-two OOB robustness matrix evaluates behavior under different boundary modes and OOB policies. In a case study, we compile a trained KAN model for DoS attack detection (CICIDS2017 pipeline) into LUT artifacts. The compiled model preserves classification quality (F1 drop below 0.0002) while reducing steady-state CPU inference latency by 12x under NumPy and 10x under Numba backends (honest baseline). The memory overhead is approximately 10x at L=64. All code and artifacts are publicly available with fixed release tags for reproducibility.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promising results in efficiency and accuracy in image classification. However, their efficacy often relies on large, labeled datasets, posing challenges for applications with limited data availability. Our research addresses these challenges by introducing an innovative approach that leverages projected quantum kernels (PQK) to enhance feature extraction for CNNs, specifically tailored for small datasets. Projected quantum kernels, derived from quantum computing principles, offer a promising avenue for capturing complex patterns and intricate data structures that traditional CNNs might miss. By incorporating these kernels into the feature extraction process, we improved the representational ability of CNNs. Our experiments demonstrated that, with 1000 training samples, the PQK-enhanced CNN achieved 95% accuracy on the MNIST dataset and 90% on the CIFAR-10 dataset, significantly outperforming the classical CNN, which achieved only 60% and 12% accuracy on the respective datasets. This research reveals the potential of quantum computing in overcoming data scarcity issues in machine learning and paves the way for future exploration of quantum-assisted neural networks, suggesting that projected quantum kernels can serve as a powerful approach for enhancing CNN-based classification in data-constrained environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework to accelerate route prediction in Drone-as-a-Service operations through weather-aware deep learning models. While classical path-planning algorithms, such as A* and Dijkstra, provide optimal solutions, their computational complexity limits real-time applicability in dynamic environments. We address this limitation by training machine learning and deep learning models on synthetic datasets generated from classical algorithm simulations. Our approach incorporates transformer-based and attention-based architectures that utilize weather heuristics to predict optimal next-node selections while accounting for meteorological conditions affecting drone operations. The attention mechanisms dynamically weight environmental factors including wind patterns, wind bearing, and temperature to enhance routing decisions under adverse weather conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our weather-aware models achieve significant computational speedup over traditional algorithms while maintaining route optimization performance, with transformer-based architectures showing superior adaptation to dynamic environmental constraints. The proposed framework enables real-time, weather-responsive route optimization for large-scale DaaS operations, representing a substantial advancement in the efficiency and safety of autonomous drone systems.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of synthetic data for training Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced the technical challenge of "model collapse"-a degenerative process where recursive training on model-generated content leads to a contraction of distributional variance and representational quality. While the phenomenology of collapse is increasingly evident, rigorous methods to quantify and predict its onset in high-dimensional spaces remain elusive. In this paper, we introduce SIGMA (Spectral Inequalities for Gram Matrix Analysis), a unified framework that benchmarks model collapse through the spectral lens of the embedding Gram matrix. By deriving and utilizing deterministic and stochastic bounds on the matrix's spectrum, SIGMA provides a mathematically grounded metric to track the contraction of the representation space. Crucially, our stochastic formulation enables scalable estimation of these bounds, making the framework applicable to large-scale foundation models where full eigendecomposition is intractable. We demonstrate that SIGMA effectively captures the transition towards degenerate states, offering both theoretical insights into the mechanics of collapse and a practical, scalable tool for monitoring the health of recursive training pipelines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDAC的基底样与经典型分子分型具有明确的预后和治疗指导价值，但基于RNA-seq的检测方法成本高、周期长、组织要求严格，限制了临床应用的普及。

Method: 提出PanSubNet双尺度深度学习框架，整合细胞级形态特征与组织级结构信息，利用注意力机制进行多尺度表征学习和透明特征归因。模型基于1,055例患者（PANCAN队列846例，TCGA队列209例）的H&E染色切片及匹配转录组数据开发，使用改进的Moffitt 50基因标记（GATA6表达精炼）建立标签。

Result: 内部验证（五折交叉验证）平均AUC达88.5%，外部独立验证（TCGA队列无微调）AUC为84.0%，表明优秀的泛化能力。预测结果与转录组程序、分化标记及DNA损伤修复特征保持一致。在转移性疾病中，模型甚至强化了预后分层能力。预测不确定性反映真实的中间转录状态而非伪分类噪声。

Conclusion: PanSubNet通过常规H&E切片实现了快速、经济且可解释的分子分型，为PDAC精准肿瘤学提供了临床可部署工具。正在进行多中心现实世界验证，支持其整合至数字病理工作流程，推动PDAC的个体化治疗。

Abstract: Molecular subtyping of PDAC into basal-like and classical has established prognostic and predictive value. However, its use in clinical practice is limited by cost, turnaround time, and tissue requirements, thereby restricting its application in the management of PDAC. We introduce PanSubNet, an interpretable deep learning framework that predicts therapy-relevant molecular subtypes directly from standard H&E-stained WSIs. PanSubNet was developed using data from 1,055 patients across two multi-institutional cohorts (PANCAN, n=846; TCGA, n=209) with paired histology and RNA-seq data. Ground-truth labels were derived using the validated Moffitt 50-gene signature refined by GATA6 expression. The model employs dual-scale architecture that fuses cellular-level morphology with tissue-level architecture, leveraging attention mechanisms for multi-scale representation learning and transparent feature attribution. On internal validation within PANCAN using five-fold cross-validation, PanSubNet achieved mean AUC of 88.5% with balanced sensitivity and specificity. External validation on the independent TCGA cohort without fine-tuning demonstrated robust generalizability (AUC 84.0%). PanSubNet preserved and, in metastatic disease, strengthened prognostic stratification compared to RNA-seq based labels. Prediction uncertainty linked to intermediate transcriptional states, not classification noise. Model predictions are aligned with established transcriptomic programs, differentiation markers, and DNA damage repair signatures. By enabling rapid, cost-effective molecular stratification from routine H&E-stained slides, PanSubNet offers a clinically deployable and interpretable tool for genetic subtyping. We are gathering data from two institutions to validate and assess real-world performance, supporting integration into digital pathology workflows and advancing precision oncology for PDAC.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, rigorously evaluating their robustness against adversarial jailbreaks is essential. However, current safety evaluations often overestimate robustness because existing automated attacks are limited by restrictive assumptions. They typically rely on handcrafted priors or require white-box access for gradient propagation. We challenge these constraints by demonstrating that token-level iterative optimization can succeed without gradients or priors. We introduce RAILS (RAndom Iterative Local Search), a framework that operates solely on model logits. RAILS matches the effectiveness of gradient-based methods through two key innovations: a novel auto-regressive loss that enforces exact prefix matching, and a history-based selection strategy that bridges the gap between the proxy optimization objective and the true attack success rate. Crucially, by eliminating gradient dependency, RAILS enables cross-tokenizer ensemble attacks. This allows for the discovery of shared adversarial patterns that generalize across disjoint vocabularies, significantly enhancing transferability to closed-source systems. Empirically, RAILS achieves near 100% success rates on multiple open-source models and high black-box attack transferability to closed-source systems like GPT and Gemini.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Behavioral benchmarks tell us \textit{what} a model does, but not \textit{how}. We introduce a training-free mechanistic probe using attention-graph spectra. Treating each layer as a token graph, we compute algebraic connectivity ($λ_2$), smoothness, and spectral entropy. Across 12 models and 10 languages, these measures yield stable ``spectral fingerprints'' that expose discontinuities missed by standard evaluation.
  We report four results. (1) Models undergoing specific curriculum transitions (e.g., code-to-chat) show an English-only, syntax-triggered connectivity failure on non-canonical constructions, reaching $Δλ_2 \approx -0.76$. We term this scar \textit{Passive-Triggered Connectivity Collapse} (PTCC). Analysis of the Phi lineage reveals that PTCC appears and resolves across developmental stages, implicating brittle curriculum shifts rather than synthetic data per se. (2) PTCC reflects a specialization trade-off: strengthened formal routing at the expense of stylistic flexibility. (3) We identify four recurrent processing strategies; simple frozen-threshold rules enable perfect forensic identification across lineages. (4) Mechanistically, PTCC localizes to a sparse Layer 2 ``compensatory patch'' of heads that fails under syntactic stress; activation steering can partially restore connectivity, recovering $\approx 38\%$ of lost information flow.
  Finally, dominant topological regimes track tokenization density more than language identity, suggesting ``healthy'' geometry varies systematically across scripts. Overall, attention-graph spectra provide a practical tool for auditing and training-regime verification.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Mixture of Experts models are widely assumed to achieve domain specialization through sparse routing. In this work, we question this assumption by introducing COMMITTEEAUDIT, a post hoc framework that analyzes routing behavior at the level of expert groups rather than individual experts. Across three representative models and the MMLU benchmark, we uncover a domain-invariant Standing Committee. This is a compact coalition of routed experts that consistently captures the majority of routing mass across domains, layers, and routing budgets, even when architectures already include shared experts. Qualitative analysis further shows that Standing Committees anchor reasoning structure and syntax, while peripheral experts handle domain-specific knowledge. These findings reveal a strong structural bias toward centralized computation, suggesting that specialization in Mixture of Experts models is far less pervasive than commonly believed. This inherent bias also indicates that current training objectives, such as load-balancing losses that enforce uniform expert utilization, may be working against the model's natural optimization path, thereby limiting training efficiency and performance.

Conclusion: VNU-Bench填补了多源跨视频新闻理解评估的空白，为评估模型从多源信息中比较视角、对齐多模态证据和整合信息的能力提供了首个系统化基准。

Abstract: News videos are carefully edited multimodal narratives that combine narration, visuals, and external quotations into coherent storylines. In recent years, there have been significant advances in evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for news video understanding. However, existing benchmarks largely focus on single-source, intra-video reasoning, where each report is processed in isolation. In contrast, real-world news consumption is inherently multi-sourced: the same event is reported by different outlets with complementary details, distinct narrative choices, and sometimes conflicting claims that unfold over time. Robust news understanding, therefore, requires models to compare perspectives from different sources, align multimodal evidence across sources, and synthesize multi-source information. To fill this gap, we introduce VNU-Bench, the first benchmark for multi-source, cross-video understanding in the news domain. We design a set of new question types that are unique in testing models' ability of understanding multi-source multimodal news from a variety of different angles. We design a novel hybrid human-model QA generation process that addresses the issues of scalability and quality control in building a large dataset for cross-source news understanding. The dataset comprises 429 news groups, 1,405 videos, and 2,501 high-quality questions. Comprehensive evaluation of both closed- and open-source multimodal models shows that VNU-Bench poses substantial challenges for current MLLMs.

Abstract: User-Defined Text Classification (UDTC) considers the challenge of classifying input text to user-specified, previously unseen classes, a setting that arises frequently in real-world applications such as enterprise analytics, content moderation, and domain-specific information retrieval. We propose a soft-contextualized encoder architecture for UDTC which contextualizes each candidate label with the label set and a static soft prompt representation of the input query. Training on diverse, multi-source datasets enables the model to generalize effectively to zero-shot classification over entirely unseen topic sets drawn from arbitrary domains. We evaluate the proposed architecture both on held-out in-distribution test data and on multiple unseen UDTC benchmarks. Across datasets, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming or matching the baselines.

Abstract: Progressive driver behavior analytics is crucial for improving road safety and mitigating the issues caused by aggressive or inattentive driving. Previous studies have employed machine learning and deep learning techniques, which often result in low feature optimization, thereby compromising both high performance and interpretability. To fill these voids, this paper proposes a hybrid approach to driver behavior analysis that uses a 12,857-row and 18-column data set taken from Kaggle. After applying preprocessing techniques such as label encoding, random oversampling, and standard scaling, 13 machine learning algorithms were tested. The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of 95%. After deploying the LIME technique in XAI, the top 10 features with the most significant positive and negative influence on accuracy were identified, and the same algorithms were retrained. The accuracy of the Random Forest Classifier decreased slightly to 94.2%, confirming that the efficiency of the model can be improved without sacrificing performance. This hybrid model can provide a return on investment in terms of the predictive power and explainability of the driver behavior process.

Abstract: Deploying models, especially large language models (LLMs), is becoming increasingly attractive to a broader user base, including those without specialized expertise. However, due to the resource constraints of certain hardware, maintaining high accuracy with larger model while meeting the hardware requirements remains a significant challenge. Model quantization technique helps mitigate memory and compute bottlenecks, yet the added complexities of tuning and deploying quantized models further exacerbates these challenges, making the process unfriendly to most of the users. We introduce the Hardware-Aware Quantization Agent (HAQA), an automated framework that leverages LLMs to streamline the entire quantization and deployment process by enabling efficient hyperparameter tuning and hardware configuration, thereby simultaneously improving deployment quality and ease of use for a broad range of users. Our results demonstrate up to a 2.3x speedup in inference, along with increased throughput and improved accuracy compared to unoptimized models on Llama. Additionally, HAQA is designed to implement adaptive quantization strategies across diverse hardware platforms, as it automatically finds optimal settings even when they appear counterintuitive, thereby reducing extensive manual effort and demonstrating superior adaptability. Code will be released.

TL;DR: VeRPO通过基于执行统计数据的动态测试难度加权，从部分测试通过情况构建密集奖励，结合全局执行结果，为代码生成提供基于可验证执行反馈的鲁棒密集奖励框架


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于通过/失败结果的奖励在代码生成中稀疏性限制了性能提升，而现有奖励模型存在奖励不对齐和高计算成本问题。需要一种既能提供密集奖励又完全基于可验证执行反馈的方法

Result: 在多个基准和设置上的广泛实验表明，VeRPO始终优于结果驱动和基于奖励模型的基线方法，在pass@1上最高提升8.83%，时间成本极小（<0.02%）且零GPU内存开销

Conclusion: VeRPO证明了可以通过完全基于可验证执行反馈的方式合成鲁棒密集奖励，有效解决了代码生成中奖励稀疏性和现有奖励模型的高成本问题，为强化学习在代码生成中的应用提供了高效框架

Abstract: Effective reward design is a central challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for code generation. Mainstream pass/fail outcome rewards enforce functional correctness via executing unit tests, but the resulting sparsity limits potential performance gains. While recent work has explored external Reward Models (RM) to generate richer, continuous rewards, the learned RMs suffer from reward misalignment and prohibitive computational cost. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{VeRPO} (\textbf{V}erifiable D\textbf{e}nse \textbf{R}eward \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization), a novel RL framework for code generation that synthesizes \textit{robust and dense rewards fully grounded in verifiable execution feedback}. The core idea of VeRPO is constructing dense rewards from weighted partial success: by dynamically estimating the difficulty weight of each unit test based on the execution statistics during training, a dense reward is derived from the sum of weights of the passed unit tests. To solidify the consistency between partial success and end-to-end functional correctness, VeRPO further integrates the dense signal with global execution outcomes, establishing a robust and dense reward paradigm relying solely on verifiable execution feedback. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and settings demonstrate that VeRPO consistently outperforms outcome-driven and RM-based baselines, achieving up to +8.83\% gain in pass@1 with negligible time cost (< 0.02\%) and zero GPU memory overhead.

Abstract: Spherical deep learning has been widely applied to a broad range of real-world problems. Existing approaches often face challenges in balancing strong spherical geometric inductive biases with the need to model real-world heterogeneity. To solve this while retaining spherical geometry, we first introduce a designable Green's function framework (DGF) to provide new spherical operator solution strategy: Design systematic Green's functions under rotational group. Based on DGF, to model biological heterogeneity, we propose Green's-Function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) fusing 3 operator solutions: (1) Equivariant Solution derived from Equivariant Green's Function for symmetry-consistent modeling; (2) Invariant Solution derived from Invariant Green's Function to eliminate nuisance heterogeneity, e.g., consistent background field; (3) Anisotropic Solution derived from Anisotropic Green's Function to model anisotropic systems, especially fibers with preferred direction. Therefore, the resulting model, GSNO can adapt to real-world heterogeneous systems with nuisance variability and anisotropy while retaining spectral efficiency. Evaluations on spherical MNIST, Shallow Water Equation, diffusion MRI fiber prediction, cortical parcellation and molecule structure modeling demonstrate the superiority of GSNO.

Abstract: Chronic diseases such as diabetes pose significant management challenges, particularly due to the risk of complications like hypoglycemia, which require timely detection and intervention. Continuous health monitoring through wearable sensors offers a promising solution for early prediction of glycemic events. However, effective use of multisensor data is hindered by issues such as signal noise and frequent missing values. This study examines the limitations of existing datasets and emphasizes the temporal characteristics of key features relevant to hypoglycemia prediction. A comprehensive analysis of imputation techniques is conducted, focusing on those employed in state-of-the-art studies. Furthermore, imputation methods derived from machine learning and deep learning applications in other healthcare contexts are evaluated for their potential to address longer gaps in time-series data. Based on this analysis, a systematic paradigm is proposed, wherein imputation strategies are tailored to the nature of specific features and the duration of missing intervals. The review concludes by emphasizing the importance of investigating the temporal dynamics of individual features and the implementation of multiple, feature-specific imputation techniques to effectively address heterogeneous temporal patterns inherent in the data.

Abstract: Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) has shown strong potential for identifying anomalies and outliers in high-dimensional data across a wide range of real-world applications, including landslide failure detection in granular media. Early and accurate identification of failure zones in landslide-prone areas is crucial for effective geohazard mitigation. While existing approaches typically rely on surface displacement data analyzed through statistical or machine learning techniques, they often fall short in capturing both the spatial correlations and temporal dynamics that are inherent in such data. To address this gap, we focus on ground-monitored landslides and introduce a novel approach that jointly incorporates spatial and temporal information, enabling the detection of complex landslides and including multiple successive failures occurring in distinct areas of the same slope. To be specific, our method builds upon an existing LID-based technique, known as sLID. We extend its capabilities in three key ways. (1) Kinematic enhancement: we incorporate velocity into the sLID computation to better capture short-term temporal dependencies and deformation rate relationships. (2) Spatial fusion: we apply Bayesian estimation to aggregate sLID values across spatial neighborhoods, effectively embedding spatial correlations into the LID scores. (3) Temporal modeling: we introduce a temporal variant, tLID, that learns long-term dynamics from time series data, providing a robust temporal representation of displacement behavior. Finally, we integrate both components into a unified framework, referred to as spatiotemporal LID (stLID), to identify samples that are anomalous in either or both dimensions. Extensive experiments show that stLID consistently outperforms existing methods in failure detection precision and lead-time.

<details>

Motivation: 混合专家模型的核心机制（Top-k路由和辅助负载均衡）目前仍是启发式的，缺乏统一理论支持，需要建立理论基础来支撑这些实践并为新型设计提供指导。

Method: 构建贝叶斯框架将路由机制推导为最优稀疏后验近似和先验正则化，从信息论角度将其形式化为最小化路由模糊度和最大化信道容量的机制，分析路由的NP-hard组合性质，证明相干性屏障的存在，验证正交性正则化的有效性。

Result: 理论证明了当专家表示具有高互相关性时贪婪路由策略无法恢复最优专家子集（相干性屏障），形式化验证了在专家特征空间施加几何正交性足以缩小NP-hard全局最优与多项式时间贪婪近似之间的差距，比较分析确认正交性正则化为大规模模型的最佳工程松弛方法。

Conclusion: 本文为混合专家模型提供了重要的理论基础和技术保证，对MoE的深入理解和新型设计具有重要意义，特别是正交性正则化作为工程实践的理论支持。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts models enable large language models to scale efficiently, as they only activate a subset of experts for each input. Their core mechanisms, Top-k routing and auxiliary load balancing, remain heuristic, however, lacking a cohesive theoretical underpinning to support them. To this end, we build the first unified theoretical framework that rigorously derives these practices as optimal sparse posterior approximation and prior regularization from a Bayesian perspective, while simultaneously framing them as mechanisms to minimize routing ambiguity and maximize channel capacity from an information-theoretic perspective. We also pinpoint the inherent combinatorial hardness of routing, defining it as the NP-hard sparse subset selection problem. We rigorously prove the existence of a "Coherence Barrier"; when expert representations exhibit high mutual coherence, greedy routing strategies theoretically fail to recover the optimal expert subset. Importantly, we formally verify that imposing geometric orthogonality in the expert feature space is sufficient to narrow the divide between the NP-hard global optimum and polynomial-time greedy approximation. Our comparative analyses confirm orthogonality regularization as the optimal engineering relaxation for large-scale models. Our work offers essential theoretical support and technical assurance for a deeper understanding and novel designs of MoE.

TL;DR: ALERT是一种零样本越狱检测框架，通过放大良性提示与越狱提示的内部特征差异来检测新型攻击，无需训练时的越狱模板。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的越狱检测方法主要依赖训练数据中的越狱模板，但现实世界中新型攻击不断涌现和演化，需要解决更具挑战性的零样本越狱检测问题。

Method: 提出了一个分层、分模块、分token的放大框架，逐步放大良性提示与越狱提示的内在特征差异：首先识别安全相关层，然后定位内在编码零样本判别信号的特定模块，最后定位信息丰富的安全token。在此基础上引入了ALERT检测器，使用两个独立但互补的分类器对放大后的表征进行分类。

Result: 在三个安全基准测试上的大量实验表明，ALERT能持续实现强大的零样本检测性能：(i)在所有数据集和攻击策略中，ALERT都可靠地排名前两位；(ii)在平均准确率和F1分数上至少超过第二好的基线方法10%，有时甚至超过40%。

Conclusion: ALERT是一个高效且有效的零样本越狱检测器，通过对放大后的表征进行分类，在检测新型、未见过的攻击时表现出优越性能，解决了现实世界中不断演化的越狱攻击检测问题。

Abstract: Despite rich safety alignment strategies, large language models (LLMs) remain highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which compromise safety guardrails and pose serious security risks. Existing detection methods mainly detect jailbreak status relying on jailbreak templates present in the training data. However, few studies address the more realistic and challenging zero-shot jailbreak detection setting, where no jailbreak templates are available during training. This setting better reflects real-world scenarios where new attacks continually emerge and evolve. To address this challenge, we propose a layer-wise, module-wise, and token-wise amplification framework that progressively magnifies internal feature discrepancies between benign and jailbreak prompts. We uncover safety-relevant layers, identify specific modules that inherently encode zero-shot discriminative signals, and localize informative safety tokens. Building upon these insights, we introduce ALERT (Amplification-based Jailbreak Detector), an efficient and effective zero-shot jailbreak detector that introduces two independent yet complementary classifiers on amplified representations. Extensive experiments on three safety benchmarks demonstrate that ALERT achieves consistently strong zero-shot detection performance. Specifically, (i) across all datasets and attack strategies, ALERT reliably ranks among the top two methods, and (ii) it outperforms the second-best baseline by at least 10% in average Accuracy and F1-score, and sometimes by up to 40%.

Abstract: Smartphone sensing offers an unobtrusive and scalable way to track daily behaviors linked to mental health, capturing changes in sleep, mobility, and phone use that often precede symptoms of stress, anxiety, or depression. While most prior studies focus on detection that responds to existing conditions, forecasting mental health enables proactive support through Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive benchmarking study comparing traditional machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and large language model (LLM) approaches for mental health forecasting using the College Experience Sensing (CES) dataset, the most extensive longitudinal dataset of college student mental health to date. We systematically evaluate models across temporal windows, feature granularities, personalization strategies, and class imbalance handling. Our results show that DL models, particularly Transformer (Macro-F1 = 0.58), achieve the best overall performance, while LLMs show strength in contextual reasoning but weaker temporal modeling. Personalization substantially improves forecasts of severe mental health states. By revealing how different modeling approaches interpret phone sensing behavioral data over time, this work lays the groundwork for next-generation, adaptive, and human-centered mental health technologies that can advance both research and real-world well-being.

Conclusion: LTS在Tree-of-Thoughts框架中能够确保成本效益和时间效率，尤其适用于延迟敏感和资源受限的应用场景。

Abstract: Recent studies explored integrating state-space search algorithms with Language Models (LM) to perform look-ahead on the token generation process, the ''Tree-of-Thoughts'' (ToT), generated by LMs, thereby improving performance on problem-solving tasks. However, the affiliated search algorithms often overlook the significant computational costs associated with LM inference, particularly in scenarios with constrained computational budgets. Consequently, we address the problem of improving LM performance on problem-solving tasks under limited computational budgets. We demonstrate how the probabilities assigned to thoughts by LMs can serve as a heuristic to guide search within the ToT framework, thereby reducing the number of thought evaluations. Building on this insight, we adapt a heuristic search algorithm, Levin Tree Search (LTS), to the ToT framework, which leverages LMs as policies to guide the tree exploration efficiently. We extend the theoretical results of LTS by showing that, for ToT (a pruned tree), LTS guarantees a bound on the number of states expanded, and consequently, on the number of thoughts generated. Additionally, we analyze the sensitivity of this bound to the temperature values commonly used in the final softmax layer of the LM. Empirical evaluation under a fixed LM query budget demonstrates that LTS consistently achieves comparable or higher accuracy than baseline search algorithms within the ToT framework, across three domains (Blocksworld, PrOntoQA, Array Sorting) and four distinct LMs. These findings highlight the efficacy of LTS on ToT, particularly in enabling cost-effective and time-efficient problem-solving, making it well-suited for latency-critical and resource-constrained applications.

Focusing on Beethoven's piano sonatas as a case study, we empirically verify the independence of pitch and hand attributes using normalized mutual information (NMI=0.167) and propose the Smart Embedding architecture, achieving a 48.30% reduction in parameters. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs using information theory (negligible loss bounded at 0.153 bits), Rademacher complexity (28.09% tighter generalization bound), and category theory to demonstrate improved stability and generalization. Empirical results show a 9.47% reduction in validation loss, confirmed by SVD analysis and an expert listening study (N=53). This dual theoretical and applied framework bridges gaps in AI music generation, offering verifiable insights for mathematically grounded deep learning.

Abstract: Digital twins and other simulators are increasingly used to support routing decisions in large-scale networks. However, simulator outputs often exhibit systematic bias, while ground-truth measurements are costly and scarce. We study a stochastic shortest-path problem in which a planner has access to abundant synthetic samples, limited real-world observations, and an edge-similarity structure capturing expected behavioral similarity across links. We model the simulator-to-reality discrepancy as an unknown, edge-specific bias that varies smoothly over the similarity graph, and estimate it using Laplacian-regularized least squares. This approach yields calibrated edge cost estimates even in data-scarce regimes. We establish finite-sample error bounds, translate estimation error into path-level suboptimality guarantees, and propose a computable, data-driven certificate that verifies near-optimality of a candidate route. For cold-start settings without initial real data, we develop a bias-aware active learning algorithm that leverages the simulator and adaptively selects edges to measure until a prescribed accuracy is met. Numerical experiments on multiple road networks and traffic graphs further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

Abstract: Artificial neural network operators (ANNOs) have been widely used for approximating deterministic input-output functions; however, their extension to random dynamics remains comparatively unexplored. In this paper, we construct a new class of \textbf{Kantorovich-type Stochastic Neural Network Operators (K-SNNOs)} in which randomness is incorporated not at the coefficient level, but through \textbf{stochastic neurons} driven by stochastic integrators. This framework enables the operator to inherit the probabilistic structure of the underlying process, making it suitable for modeling and approximating stochastic signals. We establish mean-square convergence of K-SNNOs to the target stochastic process and derive quantitative error estimates expressing the rate of approximation in terms of the modulus of continuity. Numerical simulations further validate the theoretical results by demonstrating accurate reconstruction of sample paths and rapid decay of the mean square error (MSE). Graphical results, including sample-wise approximations and empirical MSE behaviour, illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed stochastic-neuron-based operator.

Abstract: Job scheduling is widely used in real-world manufacturing systems to assign ordered job operations to machines under various constraints. Existing solutions remain limited by long running time or insufficient schedule quality, especially when problem scale increases. In this paper, we propose ReLA, a reinforcement-learning (RL) scheduler built on structured representation learning and aggregation. ReLA first learns diverse representations from scheduling entities, including job operations and machines, using two intra-entity learning modules with self-attention and convolution and one inter-entity learning module with cross-attention. These modules are applied in a multi-scale architecture, and their outputs are aggregated to support RL decision-making. Across experiments on small, medium, and large job instances, ReLA achieves the best makespan in most tested settings over the latest solutions. On non-large instances, ReLA reduces the optimality gap of the SOTA baseline by 13.0%, while on large-scale instances it reduces the gap by 78.6%, with the average optimality gaps lowered to 7.3% and 2.1%, respectively. These results confirm that ReLA's learned representations and aggregation provide strong decision support for RL scheduling, and enable fast job completion and decision-making for real-world applications.

Motivation: 基础模型虽然强大但决策过程往往不透明。神经科学与人工智能领域持续关注是否存在像'祖母细胞'那样专门对单一概念响应的神经元，这类神经元因其高度特异性而具备固有可解释性。本文旨在量化神经元对单一概念的显著性和选择性，验证在基础模型中是否能自发形成此类可解释神经元的涌现。

Method: 1）提出两个信息论度量：神经元对概念的显著性（saliency）和选择性（selectivity）；2）将度量应用于表格基础模型TabPFN的表示层；3）对神经元-概念对进行简单搜索，找出最显著和最具有选择性的配对

Result: 分析首次提供了证据：在此类模型中，部分神经元对高级概念表现出适度但统计显著的显著性和选择性。这意味着这些神经元在没有特殊干预的情况下自然涌现出可解释特性，且可以通过相对简单的技术（而非复杂的可解释性方法）被识别。

Conclusion: 研究发现基础模型中可以自发形成对单一概念具有适度特异性的可解释神经元，这为理解模型内部表示提供了新视角，并表明在某些情况下，无需依赖复杂解释技术即可识别这类神经元，为模型可解释性研究开辟了更简洁的路径。

Abstract: Foundation models are powerful yet often opaque in their decision-making. A topic of continued interest in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence is whether some neurons behave like grandmother cells, i.e., neurons that are inherently interpretable because they exclusively respond to single concepts. In this work, we propose two information-theoretic measures that quantify the neuronal saliency and selectivity for single concepts. We apply these metrics to the representations of TabPFN, a tabular foundation model, and perform a simple search across neuron-concept pairs to find the most salient and selective pair. Our analysis provides the first evidence that some neurons in such models show moderate, statistically significant saliency and selectivity for high-level concepts. These findings suggest that interpretable neurons can emerge naturally and that they can, in some cases, be identified without resorting to more complex interpretability techniques.

Conclusion: AMIR-GRPO通过利用组内奖励排名信息有效解决GRPO的结构性限制，显著提升了在复杂推理任务上的对齐效果和性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become the primary paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) widely used in large-scale post-training. However, GRPO faces structural limitations in reasoning-heavy settings: sequence-level advantage normalization introduces systematic length bias, penalties for low-quality trajectories are diluted, and the scalar objective discards rich pairwise preference information embedded in within-group reward rankings. As a result, valuable supervision from costly rollouts remains underutilized.
  We propose AMIR-GRPO, which augments GRPO with an implicit DPO-style contrastive regularizer constructed directly from intra-group reward rankings, requiring no additional annotations. This mechanism amplifies suppression of low-reward trajectories, attenuates response-level length bias, and transforms each rollout group into a denser set of supervision constraints. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, AMIR-GRPO consistently outperforms strong GRPO baselines, yields clearer separation between correct and incorrect reasoning chains, and delivers broader coverage gains beyond the subset of instances solved by standard GRPO.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a framework for integrating physical laws with data. However, their application to Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) remains constrained by the limited uncertainty quantification (UQ) capabilities. Most existing PINN-based prognostics approaches are deterministic or account only for epistemic uncertainty, limiting their suitability for risk-aware decision-making. This work introduces a heteroscedastic Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) framework that jointly models epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, yielding full predictive posteriors for spatiotemporal insulation material ageing estimation. The approach integrates Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) with physics-based residual enforcement and prior distributions, enabling probabilistic inference within a physics-informed learning architecture. The framework is evaluated on transformer insulation ageing application, validated with a finite-element thermal model and field measurements from a solar power plant, and benchmarked against deterministic PINNs, dropout-based PINNs (d-PINNs), and alternative B-PINN variants. Results show that the proposed B-PINN provides improved predictive accuracy and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates than competing approaches. A systematic sensitivity study further analyzes the impact of boundary-condition, initial-condition, and residual sampling strategies on accuracy, calibration, and generalization. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of Bayesian physics-informed learning to support uncertainty-aware prognostics and informed decision-making in transformer asset management.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in contemporary engineering information systems for supporting decision-making across various industries, where Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been widely adopted due to their capability in modeling sequential data. Conventional RNN-based predictors adopt an encoder-only strategy with sliding historical windows as inputs to forecast future values. However, this approach treats all time steps and hidden states equally without considering their distinct contributions to forecasting, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder with Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization, RRE-PPO4Pred, which significantly improves time series modeling capacity and forecasting accuracy of the RNN models. The core innovations of this method are: (1) A novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder (RRE) framework that enhances RNNs by formulating their internal adaptation as a Markov Decision Process, creating a unified decision environment capable of learning input feature selection, hidden skip connection, and output target selection; (2) An improved Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, termed PPO4Pred, which is equipped with a Transformer-based agent for temporal reasoning and develops a dynamic transition sampling strategy to enhance sampling efficiency; (3) A co-evolutionary optimization paradigm to facilitate the learning of the RNN predictor and the policy agent, providing adaptive and interactive time series modeling. Comprehensive evaluations on five real-world datasets indicate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines, and attains accuracy better than state-of-the-art Transformer models, thus providing an advanced time series predictor in engineering informatics.

Abstract: With the rise of data-driven reaction prediction models, effective reaction descriptors are crucial for bridging the gap between real-world chemistry and digital representations. However, general-purpose, reaction-wise descriptors remain scarce. This study introduces RXNEmb, a novel reaction-level descriptor derived from RXNGraphormer, a model pre-trained to distinguish real reactions from fictitious ones with erroneous bond changes, thereby learning intrinsic bond formation and cleavage patterns. We demonstrate its utility by data-driven re-clustering of the USPTO-50k dataset, yielding a classification that more directly reflects bond-change similarities than rule-based categories. Combined with dimensionality reduction, RXNEmb enables visualization of reaction space diversity. Furthermore, attention weight analysis reveals the model's focus on chemically critical sites, providing mechanistic insight. RXNEmb serves as a powerful, interpretable tool for reaction fingerprinting and analysis, paving the way for more data-centric approaches in reaction analysis and discovery.

Abstract: Graph generative diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for generating complex graph structures, effectively capturing intricate dependencies and relationships within graph data. However, the privacy risks associated with these models remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate information leakage in such models through three types of black-box inference attacks. First, we design a graph reconstruction attack, which can reconstruct graphs structurally similar to those training graphs from the generated graphs. Second, we propose a property inference attack to infer the properties of the training graphs, such as the average graph density and the distribution of densities, from the generated graphs. Third, we develop two membership inference attacks to determine whether a given graph is present in the training set. Extensive experiments on three different types of graph generative diffusion models and six real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks, significantly outperforming the baseline approaches. Finally, we propose two defense mechanisms that mitigate these inference attacks and achieve a better trade-off between defense strength and target model utility than existing methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with group-based objectives, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), is a common framework for aligning large language models on complex reasoning tasks. However, standard GRPO treats each rollout trajectory as an independent flat sequence and assigns a single sequence-level advantage to all tokens, which leads to sample inefficiency and a length bias toward verbose, redundant chains of thought without improving logical depth. We introduce TreeAdv (Tree-Structured Advantage Redistribution for Group-Based RL), which makes the tree structure of group rollouts explicit for both exploration and advantage assignment. Specifically, TreeAdv builds a group of trees (a forest) based on an entropy-driven sampling method where each tree branches at high-uncertainty decisions while sharing low-uncertainty tokens across rollouts. Then, TreeAdv aggregates token-level advantages for internal tree segments by redistributing the advantages of complete rollouts (all leaf nodes), and TreeAdv can easily apply to group-based objectives such as GRPO or GSPO. Across 10 math reasoning benchmarks, TreeAdv consistently outperforms GRPO and GSPO, while using substantially fewer generated tokens under identical supervision, data, and decoding budgets.

Abstract: The trade-off between predictive accuracy and data availability makes it difficult to predict protein--protein binding affinity accurately. The lack of experimentally resolved protein structures limits the performance of structure-based machine learning models, which generally outperform sequence-based methods. In order to overcome this constraint, we suggest a regression framework based on knowledge distillation that uses protein structural data during training and only needs sequence data during inference. The suggested method uses binding affinity labels and intermediate feature representations to jointly supervise the training of a sequence-based student network under the guidance of a structure-informed teacher network. Leave-One-Complex-Out (LOCO) cross-validation was used to assess the framework on a non-redundant protein--protein binding affinity benchmark dataset. A maximum Pearson correlation coefficient (P_r) of 0.375 and an RMSE of 2.712 kcal/mol were obtained by sequence-only baseline models, whereas a P_r of 0.512 and an RMSE of 2.445 kcal/mol were obtained by structure-based models. With a P_r of 0.481 and an RMSE of 2.488 kcal/mol, the distillation-based student model greatly enhanced sequence-only performance. Improved agreement and decreased bias were further confirmed by thorough error analyses. With the potential to close the performance gap between sequence-based and structure-based models as larger datasets become available, these findings show that knowledge distillation is an efficient method for transferring structural knowledge to sequence-based predictors. The source code for running inference with the proposed distillation-based binding affinity predictor can be accessed at https://github.com/wajidarshad/ProteinAffinityKD.

Abstract: Low-rank approximations of large kernel matrices are ubiquitous in machine learning, particularly for scaling Gaussian Processes to massive datasets. The Pivoted Cholesky decomposition is a standard tool for this task, offering a computationally efficient, greedy low-rank approximation. While its algebraic properties are well-documented in numerical linear algebra, its geometric intuition within the context of kernel methods often remains obscure. In this note, we elucidate the geometric interpretation of the algorithm within the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We demonstrate that the pivotal selection step is mathematically equivalent to Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) using the kernel metric, and that the Cholesky factor construction is an implicit Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. We provide a concise derivation and a minimalist Python implementation to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning drives recent advances in LLM reasoning and agentic capabilities, yet current approaches struggle with both exploration and exploitation. Exploration suffers from low success rates on difficult tasks and high costs of repeated rollouts from scratch. Exploitation suffers from coarse credit assignment and training instability: Trajectory-level rewards penalize valid prefixes for later errors, and failure-dominated groups overwhelm the few positive signals, leaving optimization without constructive direction. To this end, we propose R$^3$L, Reflect-then-Retry Reinforcement Learning with Language-Guided Exploration, Pivotal Credit, and Positive Amplification. To synthesize high-quality trajectories, R$^3$L shifts from stochastic sampling to active synthesis via reflect-then-retry, leveraging language feedback to diagnose errors, transform failed attempts into successful ones, and reduce rollout costs by restarting from identified failure points. With errors diagnosed and localized, Pivotal Credit Assignment updates only the diverging suffix where contrastive signals exist, excluding the shared prefix from gradient update. Since failures dominate on difficult tasks and reflect-then-retry produces off-policy data, risking training instability, Positive Amplification upweights successful trajectories to ensure positive signals guide the optimization process. Experiments on agentic and reasoning tasks demonstrate 5\% to 52\% relative improvements over baselines while maintaining training stability. Our code is released at https://github.com/shiweijiezero/R3L.

TL;DR: 本文针对RLVR中主流的GRPO算法的结构局限性，提出了弹性置信域（ETR）机制，通过双层弹性动态调整优化约束以匹配信号质量，在多项基准测试中超越GRPO，提升了准确性并有效缓解策略熵衰减。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在强化学习可验证奖励（RLVR）领域主导的群组相对策略优化（GRPO）算法存在结构局限性：它对所有样本施加统一、静态的置信域约束，这隐含着信号同质性假设，与结果驱动学习中优势幅度和方差显著波动的异质性本质不符。静态约束无法充分利用高质量信号，同时又不足以抑制噪声，常导致快速的熵崩溃。

Method: 提出弹性置信域（ETR）机制，通过双层弹性动态对齐优化约束与信号质量：在微观层面，根据优势幅度缩放裁剪边界，以加速从高置信度路径学习；在宏观层面，利用组方差隐含地为处于最优学习区域的任务分配更大的更新预算，构建信号感知的优化地貌。

Result: 在AIME和MATH基准测试上的广泛实验表明，ETR持续优于GRPO，实现了更高的准确性，同时有效缓解了策略熵衰减，确保持续的探索。

Conclusion: ETR机制通过动态的、信号感知的置信域约束，解决了GRPO中静态约束的结构性缺陷，在强化学习可验证奖励范式中实现了更高效、稳定的学习，为未来相关研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an important paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models, exemplified by the success of OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Currently, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) stands as the dominant algorithm in this domain due to its stable training and critic-free efficiency. However, we argue that GRPO suffers from a structural limitation: it imposes a uniform, static trust region constraint across all samples. This design implicitly assumes signal homogeneity, a premise misaligned with the heterogeneous nature of outcome-driven learning, where advantage magnitudes and variances fluctuate significantly. Consequently, static constraints fail to fully exploit high-quality signals while insufficiently suppressing noise, often precipitating rapid entropy collapse. To address this, we propose \textbf{E}lastic \textbf{T}rust \textbf{R}egions (\textbf{ETR}), a dynamic mechanism that aligns optimization constraints with signal quality. ETR constructs a signal-aware landscape through dual-level elasticity: at the micro level, it scales clipping boundaries based on advantage magnitude to accelerate learning from high-confidence paths; at the macro level, it leverages group variance to implicitly allocate larger update budgets to tasks in the optimal learning zone. Extensive experiments on AIME and MATH benchmarks demonstrate that ETR consistently outperforms GRPO, achieving superior accuracy while effectively mitigating policy entropy degradation to ensure sustained exploration.

Abstract: Domain-specific large language models (LLMs), typically developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained general-purpose LLM on specialized datasets, represent a significant advancement in applied AI. A common strategy in LLM fine-tuning is curriculum learning, which pre-orders training samples based on metrics like difficulty to improve learning efficiency compared to a random sampling strategy. However, most existing methods for LLM fine-tuning rely on a static curriculum, designed prior to training, which lacks adaptability to the model's evolving needs during fine-tuning. To address this, we propose EDCO, a novel framework based on two key concepts: inference entropy and dynamic curriculum orchestration. Inspired by recent findings that maintaining high answer entropy benefits long-term reasoning gains, EDCO prioritizes samples with high inference entropy in a continuously adapted curriculum. EDCO integrates three core components: an efficient entropy estimator that uses prefix tokens to approximate full-sequence entropy, an entropy-based curriculum generator that selects data points with the highest inference entropy, and an LLM trainer that optimizes the model on the selected curriculum. Comprehensive experiments in communication, medicine and law domains, EDCO outperforms traditional curriculum strategies for fine-tuning Qwen3-4B and Llama3.2-3B models under supervised and reinforcement learning settings. Furthermore, the proposed efficient entropy estimation reduces computational time by 83.5% while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Weather forecasts sit upstream of high-stakes decisions in domains such as grid operations, aviation, agriculture, and emergency response. Yet forecast users often face a difficult trade-off. Many decision-relevant targets are functionals of the atmospheric state variables, such as extrema, accumulations, and threshold exceedances, rather than state variables themselves. As a result, users must estimate these targets via post-processing, which can be suboptimal and can introduce structural bias. The core issue is that decisions depend on distributions over these functionals that the model is not trained to learn directly.
  In this work, we introduce GEM-2, a probabilistic transformer that jointly learns global atmospheric dynamics alongside a suite of variables that users directly act upon. Using this training recipe, we show that a lightweight (~275M params) and computationally efficient (~20-100x training speedup relative to state-of-the-art) transformer trained on the CRPS objective can directly outperform operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and be competitive with ML models that rely on expensive multi-step diffusion processes or require bespoke multi-stage fine-tuning strategies. We further demonstrate state-of-the-art economic value metrics under decision-theoretic evaluation, stable convergence to climatology at S2S and seasonal timescales, and a surprising insensitivity to many commonly assumed architectural and training design choices.

Abstract: We analyze neural scaling laws in a solvable model of last-layer fine-tuning where targets have intrinsic, instance-heterogeneous difficulty. In our Latent Instance Difficulty (LID) model, each input's target variance is governed by a latent ``precision'' drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. While generalization loss recovers standard scaling laws, our main contribution connects this to inference. The pass@$k$ failure rate exhibits a power-law decay, $k^{-β_\text{eff}}$, but the observed exponent $β_\text{eff}$ is training-dependent. It grows with sample size $N$ before saturating at an intrinsic limit $β$ set by the difficulty distribution's tail. This coupling reveals that learning shrinks the ``hard tail'' of the error distribution: improvements in the model's generalization error steepen the pass@$k$ curve until irreducible target variance dominates. The LID model yields testable, closed-form predictions for this behavior, including a compute-allocation rule that favors training before saturation and inference attempts after. We validate these predictions in simulations and in two real-data proxies: CIFAR-10H (human-label variance) and a maths teacher-student distillation task.

Abstract: Models trained on tabular data are widely used in sensitive domains, increasing the demand for explanation methods to meet transparency needs. CFIRE is a recent algorithm in this domain that constructs compact surrogate rule models from local explanations. While effective, CFIRE may assign rules associated with different classes to the same sample, introducing ambiguity. We investigate this ambiguity and propose a post-hoc pruning strategy that removes rules with low contribution or conflicting coverage, yielding smaller and less ambiguous models while preserving fidelity. Experiments across multiple datasets confirm these improvements with minimal impact on predictive performance.

Abstract: Node classification is a fundamental problem in information retrieval with many real-world applications, such as community detection in social networks, grouping articles published online and product categorization in e-commerce. Zero-shot node classification in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) presents a significant challenge, particularly due to the absence of labeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel Zero-shot Prompt Tuning (ZPT) framework to address this problem by leveraging a Universal Bimodal Conditional Generator (UBCG). Our approach begins with pre-training a graph-language model to capture both the graph structure and the associated textual descriptions of each node. Following this, a conditional generative model is trained to learn the joint distribution of nodes in both graph and text modalities, enabling the generation of synthetic samples for each class based solely on the class name. These synthetic node and text embeddings are subsequently used to perform continuous prompt tuning, facilitating effective node classification in a zero-shot setting. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our framework performs better than existing state-of-the-art baselines. We also provide ablation studies to validate the contribution of the bimodal generator. The code is provided at: https://github.com/Sethup123/ZPT.

Abstract: Detecting semantic backdoors in classification models--where some classes can be activated by certain natural, but out-of-distribution inputs--is an important problem that has received relatively little attention. Semantic backdoors are significantly harder to detect than backdoors that are based on trigger patterns due to the lack of such clearly identifiable patterns. We tackle this problem under the assumption that the clean training dataset and the training recipe of the model are both known. These assumptions are motivated by a consumer protection scenario, in which the responsible authority performs mystery shopping to test a machine learning service provider. In this scenario, the authority uses the provider's resources and tools to train a model on a given dataset and tests whether the provider included a backdoor. In our proposed approach, the authority creates a reference model pool by training a small number of clean and poisoned models using trusted infrastructure, and calibrates a model distance threshold to identify clean models. We propose and experimentally analyze a number of approaches to compute model distances and we also test a scenario where the provider performs an adaptive attack to avoid detection. The most reliable method is based on requesting adversarial training from the provider. The model distance is best measured using a set of input samples generated by inverting the models in such a way as to maximize the distance from clean samples. With these settings, our method can often completely separate clean and poisoned models, and it proves to be superior to state-of-the-art backdoor detectors as well.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Logic Tensor Network-Enhanced Generative Adversarial Network (LTN-GAN), a novel framework that enhances Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by incorporating Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) to enforce domain-specific logical constraints during the sample generation process. Although GANs have shown remarkable success in generating realistic data, they often lack mechanisms to incorporate prior knowledge or enforce logical consistency, limiting their applicability in domains requiring rule adherence. LTNs provide a principled way to integrate first-order logic with neural networks, enabling models to reason over and satisfy logical constraints. By combining the strengths of GANs for realistic data synthesis with LTNs for logical reasoning, we gain valuable insights into how logical constraints influence the generative process while improving both the diversity and logical consistency of the generated samples. We evaluate LTN-GAN across multiple datasets, including synthetic datasets (gaussian, grid, rings) and the MNIST dataset, demonstrating that our model significantly outperforms traditional GANs in terms of adherence to predefined logical constraints while maintaining the quality and diversity of generated samples. This work highlights the potential of neuro-symbolic approaches to enhance generative modeling in knowledge-intensive domains.

Abstract: One-shot federated learning (OSFL) reduces the communication cost and privacy risks of iterative federated learning by constructing a global model with a single round of communication. However, most existing methods struggle to achieve robust performance on real-world domains such as medical imaging, or are inefficient when handling non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data. To address these limitations, we introduce FALCON, a framework that enhances the effectiveness of OSFL over non-IID image data. The core idea of FALCON is to leverage the feature-aware hierarchical token sequences generation and knowledge distillation into OSFL. First, each client leverages a pretrained visual encoder with hierarchical scale encoding to compress images into hierarchical token sequences, which capture multi-scale semantics. Second, a multi-scale autoregressive transformer generator is used to model the distribution of these token sequences and generate the synthetic sequences. Third, clients upload the synthetic sequences along with the local classifier trained on the real token sequences to the server. Finally, the server incorporates knowledge distillation into global training to reduce reliance on precise distribution modeling. Experiments on medical and natural image datasets validate the effectiveness of FALCON in diverse non-IID scenarios, outperforming the best OSFL baselines by 9.58% in average accuracy.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a popular algorithm for reinforcement learning with large language models (LLMs). However, upon analyzing its clipping mechanism, we argue that it is suboptimal in certain scenarios.

To this end, we propose Adaptive-Boundary-Clipping GRPO (ABC-GRPO), an asymmetric and adaptive refinement of the original GRPO framework. We demonstrate that ABC-GRPO achieves superior performance over standard GRPO on mathematical reasoning tasks using the Qwen3 LLMs. Moreover, ABC-GRPO maintains substantially higher entropy throughout training, thereby preserving the model's exploration capacity and mitigating premature convergence.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) for large language models (LLMs) aims to enable sequential knowledge acquisition without catastrophic forgetting. Memory replay methods are widely used for their practicality and effectiveness, but most rely on fixed, step-based heuristics that often misalign with the model's actual learning progress, since identical training steps can result in varying degrees of parameter change. Motivated by recent findings that LLM forgetting mirrors the Ebbinghaus human forgetting curve, we propose FOREVER (FORgEtting curVe-inspired mEmory Replay), a novel CL framework that aligns replay schedules with a model-centric notion of time. FOREVER defines model time using the magnitude of optimizer updates, allowing forgetting curve-inspired replay intervals to align with the model's internal evolution rather than raw training steps. Building on this approach, FOREVER incorporates a forgetting curve-based replay scheduler to determine when to replay and an intensity-aware regularization mechanism to adaptively control how to replay. Extensive experiments on three CL benchmarks and models ranging from 0.6B to 13B parameters demonstrate that FOREVER consistently mitigates catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Despite the fact that cancer survivability rates vary greatly between stages, traditional survival prediction models have frequently been trained and assessed using examples from all combined phases of the disease. This method may result in an overestimation of performance and ignore the stage-specific variations. Using the SEER dataset, we created and verified explainable machine learning (ML) models to predict stage-specific cancer survivability in colorectal, stomach, and liver cancers. ML-based cancer survival analysis has been a long-standing topic in the literature; however, studies involving the explainability and transparency of ML survivability models are limited. Our use of explainability techniques, including SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), enabled us to illustrate significant feature-cancer stage interactions that would have remained hidden in traditional black-box models. We identified how certain demographic and clinical variables influenced survival differently across cancer stages and types. These insights provide not only transparency but also clinical relevance, supporting personalized treatment planning. By focusing on stage-specific models, this study provides new insights into the most important factors at each stage of cancer, offering transparency and potential clinical relevance to support personalized treatment planning.

Abstract: News recommender systems are increasingly driven by black-box models, offering little transparency for editorial decision-making. In this work, we introduce a transparent recommender system that uses fuzzy neural networks to learn human-readable rules from behavioral data for predicting article clicks. By extracting the rules at configurable thresholds, we can control rule complexity and thus, the level of interpretability. We evaluate our approach on two publicly available news datasets (i.e., MIND and EB-NeRD) and show that we can accurately predict click behavior compared to several established baselines, while learning human-readable rules. Furthermore, we show that the learned rules reveal news consumption patterns, enabling editors to align content curation goals with target audience behavior.

Abstract: Symbolic Regression aims to find symbolic expressions that describe datasets. Due to better interpretability, it is a machine learning paradigm particularly powerful for scientific discovery. In recent years, several works have expanded the concept to allow the description of similar phenomena using a single expression with varying sets of parameters, thereby introducing categorical variables. Some previous works allow only "non-shared" (category-value-specific) parameters, and others also incorporate "shared" (category-value-agnostic) parameters. We expand upon those efforts by considering multiple categorical variables, and introducing intermediate levels of parameter sharing. With two categorical variables, an intermediate level of parameter sharing emerges, i.e., parameters which are shared across either category but change across the other. The new approach potentially decreases the number of parameters, while revealing additional information about the problem. Using a synthetic, fitting-only example, we test the limits of this setup in terms of data requirement reduction and transfer learning. As a real-world symbolic regression example, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach on an astrophysics dataset used in a previous study, which considered only one categorical variable. We achieve a similar fit quality but require significantly fewer individual parameters, and extract additional information about the problem.

Abstract: Designing mechanical linkages to achieve target end-effector trajectories presents a fundamental challenge due to the intricate coupling between continuous node placements, discrete topological configurations, and nonlinear kinematic constraints. The highly nonlinear motion-to-configuration relationship means small perturbations in joint positions drastically alter trajectories, while the combinatorially expanding design space renders conventional optimization and heuristic methods computationally intractable. We introduce an autoregressive diffusion framework that exploits the dyadic nature of linkage assembly by representing mechanisms as sequentially constructed graphs, where nodes correspond to joints and edges to rigid links. Our approach combines a causal transformer with a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), both conditioned on target trajectories encoded via a transformer encoder. The causal transformer autoregressively predicts discrete topology node-by-node, while the DDPM refines each node's spatial coordinates and edge connectivity to previously generated nodes. This sequential generation enables adaptive trial-and-error synthesis where problematic nodes exhibiting kinematic locking or collisions can be selectively regenerated, allowing autonomous correction of degenerate configurations during design. Our graph-based, data-driven methodology surpasses traditional optimization approaches, enabling scalable inverse design that generalizes to mechanisms with arbitrary node counts. We demonstrate successful synthesis of linkage systems containing up to 20 nodes with extensibility to N-node architectures. This work advances autoregressive graph generation methodologies and computational kinematic synthesis, establishing new paradigms for scalable inverse design of complex mechanical systems.

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying trajectory data generated by some nonlinear dynamics, where each class corresponds to a distinct dynamical system. We propose Dynafit, a kernel-based method for learning a distance metric between training trajectories and the underlying dynamics. New observations are assigned to the class with the most similar dynamics according to the learned metric. The learning algorithm approximates the Koopman operator which globally linearizes the dynamics in a (potentially infinite) feature space associated with a kernel function. The distance metric is computed in feature space independently of its dimensionality by using the kernel trick common in machine learning. We also show that the kernel function can be tailored to incorporate partial knowledge of the dynamics when available. Dynafit is applicable to various classification tasks involving nonlinear dynamical systems and sensors. We illustrate its effectiveness on three examples: chaos detection with the logistic map, recognition of handwritten dynamics and of visual dynamic textures.

Abstract: Fine-tuning tabular foundation models (TFMs) under data scarcity is challenging, as early stopping on even scarcer validation data often fails to capture true generalization performance. We propose CausalMixFT, a method that enhances fine-tuning robustness and downstream performance by generating structurally consistent synthetic samples using Structural Causal Models (SCMs) fitted on the target dataset. This approach augments limited real data with causally informed synthetic examples, preserving feature dependencies while expanding training diversity. Evaluated across 33 classification datasets from TabArena and over 2300 fine-tuning runs, our CausalMixFT method consistently improves median normalized ROC-AUC from 0.10 (standard fine-tuning) to 0.12, outperforming purely statistical generators such as CTGAN (-0.01), TabEBM (-0.04), and TableAugment (-0.09). Moreover, it narrows the median validation-test performance correlation gap from 0.67 to 0.30, enabling more reliable validation-based early stopping, a key step toward improving fine-tuning stability under data scarcity. These results demonstrate that incorporating causal structure into data augmentation provides an effective and principled route to fine-tuning tabular foundation models in low-data regimes.

Abstract: The application of machine learning on healthcare data is often hindered by the lack of standardized and semantically explicit representation, leading to limited interoperability and reproducibility across datasets and experiments. The Medical Event Data Standard (MEDS) addresses these issues by introducing a minimal, event-centric data model designed for reproducible machine-learning workflows from health data. However, MEDS is defined as a data-format specification and does not natively provide integration with the Semantic Web ecosystem. In this article, we introduce MEDS-OWL, a lightweight OWL ontology that provides formal concepts and relations to enable representing MEDS datasets as RDF graphs. Additionally, we implemented meds2rdf, a Python conversion library that transforms MEDS events into RDF graphs, ensuring conformance with the ontology. We demonstrate the approach on a synthetic clinical dataset that describes patient care pathways for ruptured intracranial aneurysms and validate the resulting graph using SHACL constraints. The first release of MEDS-OWL comprises 13 classes, 10 object properties, 20 data properties, and 24 OWL axioms. Combined with meds2rdf, it enables data transformation into FAIR-aligned datasets, provenance-aware publishing, and interoperability of event-based clinical data. By bridging MEDS with the Semantic Web, this work contributes a reusable semantic layer for event-based clinical data and establishes a robust foundation for subsequent graph-based analytics.

Abstract: Automated blood morphology analysis can support hematological diagnostics in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) but remains sensitive to dataset shifts from staining variability, imaging differences, and rare morphologies. Building centralized datasets to capture this diversity is often infeasible due to privacy regulations and data-sharing restrictions. We introduce a federated learning framework for white blood cell morphology analysis that enables collaborative training across institutions without exchanging training data. Using blood films from multiple clinical sites, our federated models learn robust, domain-invariant representations while preserving complete data privacy. Evaluations across convolutional and transformer-based architectures show that federated training achieves strong cross-site performance and improved generalization to unseen institutions compared to centralized training. These findings highlight federated learning as a practical and privacy-preserving approach for developing equitable, scalable, and generalizable medical imaging AI in resource-limited healthcare environments.

Abstract: Reliable long-term decoding of surface electromyography (EMG) is hindered by signal drift caused by electrode shifts, muscle fatigue, and posture changes. While state-of-the-art models achieve high intra-session accuracy, their performance often degrades sharply. Existing solutions typically demand large datasets or high-compute pipelines that are impractical for energy-efficient wearables. We propose a lightweight framework for Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) backbone. We introduce three deployment-ready strategies: (i) causal adaptive batch normalization for real-time statistical alignment; (ii) a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) alignment with experience replay to prevent forgetting; and (iii) meta-learning for rapid, few-shot calibration. Evaluated on the NinaPro DB6 multi-session dataset, our framework significantly bridges the inter-session accuracy gap with minimal overhead. Our results show that experience-replay updates yield superior stability under limited data, while meta-learning achieves competitive performance in one- and two-shot regimes using only a fraction of the data required by current benchmarks. This work establishes a path toward robust, "plug-and-play" myoelectric control for long-term prosthetic use.
