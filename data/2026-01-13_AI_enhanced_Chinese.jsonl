We present DemMA, an expert-guided dementia dialogue agent for high-fidelity multi-turn patient simulation. DemMA constructs clinically grounded dementia personas by integrating pathology information, personality traits, and subtype-specific memory-status personas informed by clinical experts. To move beyond text-only simulation, DemMA explicitly models nonverbal behaviors, including motion, facial expressions, and vocal cues. We further introduce a Chain-of-Thought distillation framework that trains a single LLM to jointly generate reasoning traces, patient utterances, and aligned behavioral actions within one forward pass, enabling efficient deployment without multi-agent inference. Extensive evaluations with experts, medical students, and LLM judges demonstrate that DemMA significantly outperforms strong baselines across multiple metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite their potential for scalable cooperation, current PI methods heavily depend on fixed incentive values that need to be appropriately chosen with respect to the environmental rewards and thus are highly sensitive to their changes. Therefore, they fail to maintain cooperation under changing rewards in the environment, e.g., caused by modified specifications, varying supply and demand, or sensory flaws - even when the conditions for mutual cooperation remain the same. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Reward Incentives for Variable Exchange (DRIVE), an adaptive PI approach to cooperation in social dilemmas with changing rewards. DRIVE agents reciprocally exchange reward differences to incentivize mutual cooperation in a completely decentralized way. We show how DRIVE achieves mutual cooperation in the general Prisoner's Dilemma and empirically evaluate DRIVE in more complex sequential social dilemmas with changing rewards, demonstrating its ability to achieve and maintain cooperation, in contrast to current state-of-the-art PI methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent studies focus on hierarchical memory to model users' multi-granular behavioral patterns via clustering and aggregating historical conversations. However, conversational noise and memory hallucinations can be amplified during clustering, causing locally aggregated memories to misalign with the user's global persona. To mitigate this issue, we propose Bi-Mem, an agentic framework ensuring hierarchical memory fidelity through bidirectional construction. Specifically, we deploy an inductive agent to form the hierarchical memory: it extracts factual information from raw conversations to form fact-level memory, aggregates them into thematic scenes (i.e., local scene-level memory) using graph clustering, and infers users' profiles as global persona-level memory. Simultaneously, a reflective agent is designed to calibrate local scene-level memories using global constraints derived from the persona-level memory, thereby enforcing global-local alignment. For coherent memory recall, we propose an associative retrieval mechanism: beyond initial hierarchical search, a spreading activation process allows facts to evoke contextual scenes, while scene-level matches retrieve salient supporting factual information. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Bi-Mem achieves significant improvements in question answering performance on long-term personalized conversational tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Bi-Mem\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5c42\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\u56e0\u805a\u7c7b\u653e\u5927\u4f1a\u8bdd\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e7b\u89c9\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u671f\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u95ee\u7b54\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u671f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u514b\u670dLLMs\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u805a\u7c7b\u5386\u53f2\u5bf9\u8bdd\u65f6\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5c40\u90e8\u805a\u5408\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u5168\u5c40\u753b\u50cf\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBi-Mem\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5f52\u7eb3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63d0\u53d6\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ea7\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u805a\u5408\u6210\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u63a8\u65ad\u5168\u5c40\u753b\u50cf\u7ea7\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff1b2\uff09\u53cd\u601d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7528\u753b\u50cf\u7ea7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u7ea6\u675f\u6821\u51c6\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff1b3\uff09\u8054\u60f3\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\u5c42\u6b21\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5524\u8d77\u573a\u666f\u3001\u573a\u666f\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u671f\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u56de\u7b54\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u5411\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6Bi-Mem\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u786e\u4fdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8054\u60f3\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

Code: https://github.com/studiofarzulla/friction-marl", "summary": "Multi-agent systems face a fundamental coordination problem: agents must coordinate despite heterogeneous preferences, asymmetric stakes, and imperfect information. When coordination fails, friction emerges: measurable resistance manifesting as deadlock, thrashing, communication overhead, or outright conflict. This paper derives a formal framework for analyzing coordination friction from a single axiom: actions affecting agents require authorization from those agents in proportion to stakes.\n  From this axiom of consent, we establish the kernel triple $(\u03b1, \u03c3, \u03b5)$ (alignment, stake, and entropy) characterizing any resource allocation configuration. The friction equation $F = \u03c3 (1 + \u03b5)/(1 + \u03b1)$ predicts coordination difficulty as a function of preference alignment $\u03b1$, stake magnitude $\u03c3$, and communication entropy $\u03b5$. The Replicator-Optimization Mechanism (ROM) governs evolutionary selection over coordination strategies: configurations generating less friction persist longer, establishing consent-respecting arrangements as dynamical attractors rather than normative ideals.\n  We develop formal definitions for resource consent, coordination legitimacy, and friction-aware allocation in multi-agent systems. The framework yields testable predictions: MARL systems with higher reward alignment exhibit faster convergence; distributed allocations accounting for stake asymmetry generate lower coordination failure; AI systems with interpretability deficits produce friction proportional to the human-AI alignment gap. Applications to cryptocurrency governance and political systems demonstrate that the same equations govern friction dynamics across domains, providing a complexity science perspective on coordination under preference heterogeneity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce Contract2Plan, a verified GenAI-to-optimizer pipeline that inserts a solver-based compliance gate before plans are emitted. The system retrieves clause evidence with provenance, extracts a typed constraint schema with evidence spans, compiles constraints into a BOM-aware MILP, and verifies grounding, eligibility, consistency, and feasibility using solver diagnostics, triggering targeted repair or abstention when automation is unsafe. We formalize which clause classes admit conservative repair with contract-safe feasibility guarantees and which require human confirmation.

Energy-aware solutions use dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) to mitigate overheating in performance-intensive scenarios, while software approaches allocate high-utilization tasks across core configurations in parallel systems to reduce power. However, existing heuristics lack per-core frequency monitoring, failing to address overheating from uneven core activity, and task assignments without detailed profiling overlook irregular execution patterns. We target OpenMP DAG workloads. Because makespan, energy, and thermal goals often conflict within a single benchmark, this work prioritizes performance (makespan) while reporting energy and thermal as secondary outcomes. To overcome these issues, we propose HiDVFS (a hierarchical multi-agent, performance-aware DVFS scheduler) for parallel systems that optimizes task allocation based on profiling data, core temperatures, and makespan-first objectives. It employs three agents: one selects cores and frequencies using profiler data, another manages core combinations via temperature sensors, and a third sets task priorities during resource contention. A makespan-focused reward with energy and temperature regularizers estimates future states and enhances sample efficiency. Experiments on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 using the BOTS suite (9 benchmarks) compare HiDVFS against state-of-the-art approaches. With multi-seed validation (seeds 42, 123, 456), HiDVFS achieves the best finetuned performance with 4.16 plus/minus 0.58s average makespan (L10), representing a 3.44x speedup over GearDVFS (14.32 plus/minus 2.61s) and 50.4% energy reduction (63.7 kJ vs 128.4 kJ).

Existing deterministic approaches that combine heuristic signals, semantic similarity measures, and graph-based centrality metrics have demonstrated effectiveness in nar-rowing candidate search spaces, yet their recall plateaus. This limitation stems from the treatment of features as linearly independent contributors, ignoring contextual dependencies and relationships between metrics that characterize expert reasoning patterns. To address this limitation, we propose the application of Multi-Head Self-Attention as a post-deterministic scoring refinement mechanism. Our approach learns contextual weighting between features, dynamically adjust-ing importance levels per file based on relational behavior exhibited across candidate file sets. The attention mechanism produces context-aware adjustments that are additively combined with deterministic scores, pre-serving interpretability while enabling reasoning similar to that performed by experts when reviewing change surfaces. We focus on recall rather than precision, as false negatives (missing impacted files) are far more costly than false positives (irrelevant files that can be quickly dismissed during review). Empirical evaluation on 200 test cases demonstrates that the introduc-tion of self-attention improves Top-50 recall from approximately 62-65% to between 78-82% depending on repository complexity and structure, achiev-ing 80% recall at Top-50 files.

Spot instances offer 3-10x lower cost than on-demand instances, but their unpredictable availability makes meeting deadlines difficult. Existing systems either rely solely on spot instances and risk deadline violations, or operate in simplified single-region settings. These approaches overlook substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity in spot availability, lifetimes, and prices. We show that exploiting such heterogeneity to access more spot capacity is the key to reduce the job execution cost. We present SkyNomad, a multi-region scheduling system that maximizes spot usage and minimizes cost while guaranteeing deadlines. SkyNomad uses lightweight probing to estimate availability, predicts spot lifetimes, accounts for migration cost, and unifies regional characteristics and deadline pressure into a monetary cost model that guides scheduling decisions. Our evaluation shows that SkyNomad achieves 1.25-3.96x cost savings in real cloud deployments and performs within 10% cost differences of an optimal policy in simulation, while consistently meeting deadlines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To bridge this gap, we propose DarwinTOD, a lifelong self evolving dialog framework that systematically integrates these two paradigms, enabling continuous strategy optimization from a zero-shot base without task specific fine-tuning. DarwinTOD maintains an Evolvable Strategy Bank and operates through a dual-loop process: online multi-agent dialog execution with peer critique, and offline structured evolutionary operations that refine the strategy bank using accumulated feedback. This closed-loop design enables autonomous continuous improvement without human intervention.

Experimental evalua- tions using live CVE datasets demonstrate an 88% reduction in residual risk, an 18-day improvement in SLA compliance, and a 35% increase in remediation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art commercial baselines. These findings validate RiskBridge as a prac- tical and auditable decision-intelligence sys- tem that unifies probabilistic modeling, com- pliance reasoning, and optimization analytics.

We show that when the query is part of the input - the combined complexity setting - determining whether or not a repair exists is polynomial-time is equivalent to the satisfiability problem for classes of queries admitting a weak form of projection and selection. We then identify the sub-classes of unions of conjunctive queries with negated atoms, defined by the relational algebra operations permitted to appear in the query, for which the minimal repair problem can be solved in polynomial time. In contrast, we show that the problem is NP-hard, as well as set cover-hard to approximate via strict reductions, whenever both projection and join are permitted in the input query. Additionally, we show that finding the size of a minimal repair for unions of conjunctive queries (with negated atoms permitted) is OptP[log(n)]-complete, while computing a minimal repair is possible with O($n^2$) queries to an NP oracle. With recursion permitted, the combined complexity of all of these variants increases significantly, with an EXP lower bound.

However, little is known about how SATD manifests and evolves in contemporary Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems, whose architectures, workflows, and dependencies differ fundamentally from both traditional and pre-LLM ML software. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of SATD in the LLM era, replicating and extending prior work on ML technical debt to modern LLM-based systems. We compare SATD prevalence across LLM, ML, and non-ML repositories across a total of 477 repositories (159 per category). We perform survival analysis of SATD introduction and removal to understand the dynamics of technical debt across different development paradigms. Surprisingly, despite their architectural complexity, our results reveal that LLM repositories accumulate SATD at similar rates to ML systems (3.95% vs. 4.10%). However, we observe that LLM repositories remain debt-free 2.4x longer than ML repositories (a median of 492 days vs. 204 days), and then start to accumulate technical debt rapidly. Moreover, our qualitative analysis of 377 SATD instances reveals three new forms of technical debt unique to LLM-based development that have not been reported in prior research: Model-Stack Workaround Debt, Model Dependency Debt, and Performance Optimization Debt. Finally, by mapping SATD to stages of the LLM development pipeline, we observe that debt concentrates", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing imputation methods emphasize trajectory recovery, paying limited attention to interpretability and failing to provide underlying knowledge that benefits downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and route planning. We propose knowledge-driven interpretable vessel trajectory imputation (VISTA), the first trajectory imputation framework that offers interpretability while simultaneously providing underlying knowledge to support downstream analysis. Specifically, we first define underlying knowledge as a combination of Structured Data-derived Knowledge (SDK) distilled from AIS data and Implicit LLM Knowledge acquired from large-scale Internet corpora. Second, to manage and leverage the SDK effectively at scale, we develop a data-knowledge-data loop that employs a Structured Data-derived Knowledge Graph for SDK extraction and knowledge-driven trajectory imputation. Third, to efficiently process large-scale AIS data, we introduce a workflow management layer that coordinates the end-to-end pipeline, enabling parallel knowledge extraction and trajectory imputation with anomaly handling and redundancy elimination. Experiments on two large AIS datasets show that VISTA is capable of state-of-the-art imputation accuracy and computational efficiency, improving over state-of-the-art baselines by 5%-94% and reducing time cost by 51%-93%, while producing interpretable knowledge cues that benefit downstream tasks.

Widely used performance models primarily focus on cache and memory bandwidth, which is suitable for many memory-bound workloads. However, it is unsuitable for highly arithmetic intensive cases such as the sum-factorization with tensor $n$-mode product kernels, which are an optimization technique for high-order finite element methods (FEM). On processors with relatively high single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instruction latency, such as the Fujitsu A64FX, the performance of these kernels is strongly influenced by loop-body splitting strategies. Memory-bandwidth-oriented models are therefore not appropriate for evaluating these splitting configurations, and a model that directly reflects instruction-level efficiency is required. To address this need, we develop a dependency-chain-based analytical formulation that links loop-splitting configurations to instruction dependencies in the tensor $n$-mode product kernel. We further use XGBoost to estimate key parameters in the analytical model that are difficult to model explicitly. Evaluations show that the learning-augmented model outperforms the widely used standard Roofline and Execution-Cache-Memory (ECM) models. On the Fujitsu A64FX processor, the learning-augmented model achieves mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) between 1% and 24% for polynomial orders ($P$) from 1 to 15. In comparison, the standard Roofline and ECM models yield errors of 42%-256% and 5%-117%, respectively. On the Intel Xeon Gold 6230 processor, the learning-augmented model achieves MAPE values from 1% to 13% for $P$=1 to $P$=14, and 24% at $P$=15. In contrast, the standard Roofline and ECM models produce errors of 1%-73% and 8%-112% for $P$=1 to $P$=15, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

GPUs offer a promising path to high-performance ANNS: they provide massive parallelism for distance computations, are readily available, and can co-locate with downstream applications.\n  Despite these advantages, current GPU-accelerated ANNS systems face three key limitations. First, real-world applications operate on evolving datasets that require fast batch updates, yet most GPU indices must be rebuilt from scratch when new data arrives. Second, high-dimensional vectors strain memory bandwidth, but current GPU systems lack efficient quantization techniques that reduce data movement without introducing costly random memory accesses. Third, the data-dependent memory accesses inherent to greedy search make overlapping compute and memory difficult, leading to reduced performance.\n  We present Jasper, a GPU-native ANNS system with both high query throughput and updatability. Jasper builds on the Vamana graph index and overcomes existing bottlenecks via three contributions: (1) a CUDA batch-parallel construction algorithm that enables lock-free streaming insertions, (2) a GPU-efficient implementation of RaBitQ quantization that reduces memory footprint up to 8x without the random access penalties, and (3) an optimized greedy search kernel that increases compute utilization, resulting in better latency hiding and higher throughput.\n  Our evaluation across five datasets shows that Jasper achieves up to 1.93x higher query throughput than CAGRA and achieves up to 80% peak utilization as measured by the roofline model.

However, their reliance on local interactions makes them inherently vulnerable to malicious behavior. In this work, we investigate an adversarial threat that we term the ``Pac-Man'' attack, in which a malicious node probabilistically terminates any RW that visits it. This stealthy behavior gradually eliminates active RWs from the network, effectively halting the learning process without triggering failure alarms. To counter this threat, we propose the CREATE-IF-LATE (CIL) algorithm, which is a fully decentralized, resilient mechanism that enables self-creating RWs and prevents RW extinction in the presence of Pac-Man. Our theoretical analysis shows that the CIL algorithm guarantees several desirable properties, such as (i) non-extinction of the RW population, (ii) almost sure boundedness of the RW population, and (iii) convergence of RW-based stochastic gradient descent even in the presence of Pac-Man with a quantifiable deviation from the true optimum. Moreover, the learning process experiences at most a linear time delay due to Pac-Man interruptions and RW regeneration.

Along with these developments, challenges and opportunities exist in the field of Quantum Software Engineering, as the development of frameworks and higher-level abstractions has attracted practitioners from diverse backgrounds. Unlike initial quantum frameworks based on the circuit model, recent frameworks and libraries leverage higher-level abstractions for creating quantum programs. This paper presents an empirical study of 985 Jupyter Notebooks from 80 open-source projects to investigate how quantum patterns are applied in practice. Our work involved two main stages. First, we built a knowledge base from three quantum computing frameworks (Qiskit, PennyLane, and Classiq). This process led us to identify and document 9 new patterns that refine and extend the existing quantum computing pattern catalog.

The idea of redundant assignment is to assign a data vector to more than one IVF lists for reducing the chance of missing true neighbors in IVF search. However, the naive strategy, which selects the second IVF list based on the distance between a data vector and the list centroids, performs poorly. Previous work focuses only on the inner product distance, while there is no optimized list selection study for the most popular Euclidean space. Moreover, the IVF search may access the same vector in more than one lists, resulting in redundant distance computation and decreasing query throughput. In this paper, we present RAIRS to address the above two challenges. For the challenge of the list selection, we propose an optimized AIR metric for the Euclidean space. AIR takes not only distances but also directions into consideration in order to support queries that are closer to the data vector but father away from the first chosen list's centroid. For the challenge of redundant distance computation, we propose SEIL, an optimized list layout that exploits shared cells to reduce repeated distance computations for IVF search. Our experimental results using representative real-world data sets show that RAIRS out-performs existing redundant assignment solutions and achieves up to 1.33x improvement over the best-performing IVF method, IVF-PQ Fast Scan with refinement.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Safety requirements are often specified by multiple stakeholders with uncoordinated objectives, leading to gaps, duplications, and contradictions that jeopardize system safety and compliance. Existing approaches are largely informal and insufficient for addressing these challenges. SAFER enhances Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) by consuming requirement specification models and generating the following results: (1) mapping requirements to system functions, (2) identifying functions with insufficient requirement specifications, (3) detecting duplicate requirements, and (4) identifying contradictions within requirement sets. SAFER provides structured analysis, reporting, and decision support for safety engineers. We demonstrate SAFER on an autonomous drone system, significantly improving the detection of requirement inconsistencies, enhancing both efficiency and reliability of the safety engineering process. We show that Generative AI must be augmented by formal models and queried systematically, to provide meaningful early-stage safety requirement specifications and robust safety architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These agents differ fundamentally from traditional software: their behavior is not fixed at deployment but continuously shaped by experience, feedback, and context. Applying operational principles inherited from DevOps or MLOps, built for deterministic software and traditional ML systems, assumes that system behavior can be managed through versioning, monitoring, and rollback. This assumption breaks down for Agentic AI systems whose learning trajectories diverge over time. This introduces non-determinism making system reliability a challenge at runtime. We argue that architecting such systems requires a shift from managing control loops to enabling dynamic co-evolution among agents, infrastructure, and human oversight. To guide this shift, we introduce CHANGE, a conceptual framework comprising six capabilities for operationalizing Agentic AI systems: Contextualize, Harmonize, Anticipate, Negotiate, Generate, and Evolve. CHANGE provides a foundation for architecting an AgentOps platform to manage the lifecycle of evolving Agentic AI systems, illustrated through a customer-support system scenario.

Evaluating LLMs in Resolving Context Adaptation Bugs During Code Adaptation", "comment": "24 pages, 11 figures, accepted by FSE 2026", "summary": "Code adaptation is a fundamental but challenging task in software development, requiring developers to modify existing code for new contexts. A key challenge is to resolve Context Adaptation Bugs (CtxBugs), which occurs when code correct in its original context violates constraints in the target environment. Unlike isolated bugs, CtxBugs cannot be resolved through local fixes and require cross-context reasoning to identify semantic mismatches. Overlooking them may lead to critical failures in adaptation. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show great potential in automating code-related tasks, their ability to resolve CtxBugs remains a significant and unexplored obstacle to their practical use in code adaptation. To bridge this gap, we propose CtxBugGen, a novel framework for generating CtxBugs to evaluate LLMs. Its core idea is to leverage LLMs' tendency to generate plausible but context-free code when contextual constraints are absent. The framework generates CtxBugs through a four-step process to ensure their relevance and validity: (1) Adaptation Task Selection, (2) Task-specific Perturbation,(3) LLM-based Variant Generation and (4) CtxBugs Identification. Based on the benchmark constructed by CtxBugGen, we conduct an empirical study with four state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results reveal their unsatisfactory performance in CtxBug resolution. The best performing LLM, Kimi-K2, achieves 55.93% on Pass@1 and resolves just 52.47% of CtxBugs. The presence of CtxBugs degrades LLMs' adaptation performance by up to 30%. Failure analysis indicates that LLMs often overlook CtxBugs and replicate them in their outputs. Our study highlights a critical weakness in LLMs' cross-context reasoning and emphasize the need for new methods to enhance their context awareness for reliable code adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CtxBugGen\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9002\u5e94\u7f3a\u9677\uff08CtxBugs\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709LLMs\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u7c7b\u8de8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7801\u9002\u5e94\u662f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9002\u5e94\u7f3a\u9677\uff08CtxBugs\uff09\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8fd9\u7c7b\u7f3a\u9677\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u4fee\u590d\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8de8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u89e3\u51b3CtxBugs\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CtxBugGen\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u6b65\u6d41\u7a0b\u751f\u6210CtxBugs\uff1a1) \u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u9009\u62e9\uff1b2) \u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6270\u52a8\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\u751f\u6210\uff1b4) CtxBug\u8bc6\u522b\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u56db\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aLLMs\u5728\u89e3\u51b3CtxBugs\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u6700\u4f73\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u6a21\u578bKimi-K2\u5728Pass@1\u4e0a\u4ec5\u8fbe\u523055.93%\uff0c\u4ec5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e8652.47%\u7684CtxBugs\u3002CtxBugs\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u4f7fLLMs\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u8fbe30%\u3002\u5931\u8d25\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eLLMs\u5e38\u5e38\u5ffd\u89c6CtxBugs\u5e76\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u590d\u5236\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u8de8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u589e\u5f3aLLMs\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u9002\u5e94\u3002"}}

This complexity spans not only distributed parallelism strategies (tensor/pipeline/expert) but also intricate framework-specific runtime parameters such as those concerning the enablement of CUDA graphs, available KV-cache memory fractions, and maximum token capacity, which drastically impact performance. The diversity of modern inference frameworks (e.g., TRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang), each employing distinct kernels and execution policies, makes manual tuning both framework-specific and computationally prohibitive. We present AIConfigurator, a unified performance-modeling system that enables rapid, framework-agnostic inference configuration search without requiring GPU-based profiling. AIConfigurator combines (1) a methodology that decomposes inference into analytically modelable primitives - GEMM, attention, communication, and memory operations while capturing framework-specific scheduling dynamics; (2) a calibrated kernel-level performance database for these primitives across a wide range of hardware platforms and popular open-weights models (GPT-OSS, Qwen, DeepSeek, LLama, Mistral); and (3) an abstraction layer that automatically resolves optimal launch parameters for the target backend, seamlessly integrating into production-grade orchestration systems. Evaluation on production LLM serving workloads demonstrates that AIConfigurator identifies superior serving configurations that improve performance by up to 40% for dense models (e.g., Qwen3-32B) and 50% for MoE architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-V3), while completing searches within 30 seconds on average.

Empirical results demonstrate that Fixturize is highly effective, achieving 88.38%-97.00% accuracy across benchmarks in identifying the dependence of test fixtures and significantly enhancing the Suite Pass rate (SuitePS) by 18.03%-42.86% on average across both PLs with the auto-generated fixtures. Owing to the maintenance of test fixtures, Fixturize further improves line/branch coverage when integrated with existing testing tools of both LLM-based and Search-based by 16.85%/24.08% and 31.54%/119.66% on average, respectively. The findings establish fixture awareness as an essential, missing component in modern auto-testing pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Fixturize\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8bca\u65ad\u5939\u5177\u4f9d\u8d56\u51fd\u6570\u5e76\u5408\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5939\u5177\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u751f\u6210\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u65f6\uff0c\u5e38\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u6784\u9020\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5939\u5177\uff08\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fd0\u884c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u73af\u5883\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u8d28\u91cf\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFixturize\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c1) \u4e3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u5939\u5177\u4f9d\u8d56\u51fd\u6570\uff0c2) \u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5408\u6210\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5939\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e13\u7528\u57fa\u51c6FixtureEval\uff08\u5305\u542b600\u4e2aPython\u548cJava\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e26\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7684\u5939\u5177\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u7b7e\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "Fixturize\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5939\u5177\u4f9d\u8d56\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u523088.38%-97.00%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5939\u5177\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5c06Suite Pass\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u4e8618.03%-42.86%\uff1b\u96c6\u6210\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\u540e\uff0c\u5c06\u884c\u8986\u76d6\u7387/\u5206\u652f\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e8616.85%/24.08%\uff08LLM-based\uff09\u548c31.54%/119.66%\uff08Search-based\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5939\u5177\u610f\u8bc6\u662f\u73b0\u4ee3\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u4f46\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0cFixturize\u901a\u8fc7\u8865\u5145\u8fd9\u4e00\u7f3a\u5931\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose CrossTrafficLLM, a novel GenAI-driven framework that simultaneously predicts future spatiotemporal traffic states and generates corresponding natural language descriptions, specifically targeting conditional abnormal event summaries. We tackle the core challenge of aligning quantitative traffic data with qualitative textual semantics by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) within a unified architecture. This design allows generative textual context to improve prediction accuracy while ensuring generated reports are directly informed by the forecast. Technically, a text-guided adaptive graph convolutional network is employed to effectively merge high-level semantic information with the traffic network structure. Evaluated on the BJTT dataset, CrossTrafficLLM demonstrably surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both traffic forecasting performance and text generation quality.

Tasks that assess specific capabilities of the agents can be correlated and stochastic, requiring many samples for accurate comparisons, leading to added costs. In this paper, we propose a formal definition and a conceptual framework for active evaluation of agents across multiple tasks, which assesses the performance of ranking algorithms as a function of number of evaluation data samples. Rather than curating, filtering, or compressing existing data sets as a preprocessing step, we propose an online framing: on every iteration, the ranking algorithm chooses the task and agents to sample scores from. Then, evaluation algorithms report a ranking of agents on each iteration and their performance is assessed with respect to the ground truth ranking over time. Several baselines are compared under different experimental contexts, with synthetic generated data and simulated online access to real evaluation data from Atari game-playing agents. We find that the classical Elo rating system -- while it suffers from well-known failure modes, in theory -- is a consistently reliable choice for efficient reduction of ranking error in practice. A recently-proposed method, Soft Condorcet Optimization, shows comparable performance to Elo on synthetic data and significantly outperforms Elo on real Atari agent evaluation. When task variation from the ground truth is high, selecting tasks based on proportional representation leads to higher rate of ranking error reduction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Fairness issues have attracted increasing attention since machine learning software is increasingly used for high-stakes and high-risk decisions. It is the responsibility of all software developers to make their software accountable by ensuring that the machine learning software do not perform differently on different sensitive groups -- satisfying the separation criterion. However, evaluation of separation requires ground truth labels for each test data point. This motivates our work on analyzing whether separation can be evaluated on comparative judgment test data. Instead of asking humans to provide the ratings or categorical labels on each test data point, comparative judgments are made between pairs of data points such as A is better than B. According to the law of comparative judgment, providing such comparative judgments yields a lower cognitive burden for humans than providing ratings or categorical labels. This work first defines the novel fairness notion comparative separation on comparative judgment test data, and the metrics to evaluate comparative separation. Then, both theoretically and empirically, we show that in binary classification problems, comparative separation is equivalent to separation. Lastly, we analyze the number of test data points and test data pairs required to achieve the same level of statistical power in the evaluation of separation and comparative separation, respectively. This work is the first to explore fairness evaluation on comparative judgment test data. It shows the feasibility and the practical benefits of using comparative judgment test data for model evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Rather than modeling rapid adaptation as implicit optimization or meta-learning, we formulate task- and context-specific learning as the sequential inference of a low-dimensional latent adaptation state governed by a linearized state-space model. Under Gaussian assumptions, adaptation follows a Kalman recursion with closed-form updates for both the posterior mean and covariance.\n  This perspective elevates epistemic uncertainty to an explicit dynamical variable. We show that inference-time learning is driven by covariance collapse, i.e., rapid contraction of posterior uncertainty induced by informative tokens, which typically precedes convergence of the posterior mean. Using observability conditions on token-level Jacobians, we establish stability of the Bayesian filter, prove exponential covariance contraction rates, and derive mean-square error bounds. Gradient descent, natural-gradient methods, and meta-learning updates arise as singular, noise-free limits of the filtering dynamics, positioning optimization-based adaptation as a degenerate approximation of Bayesian inference.\n  The resulting theory provides a unified probabilistic account of in-context learning, parameter-efficient adaptation, and test-time learning without parameter updates. It yields explicit guarantees on stability and sample efficiency, offers a principled interpretation of prompt informativeness via information accumulation, and clarifies the role of uncertainty dynamics absent from existing accounts. Minimal illustrative experiments corroborate the qualitative predictions of the theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u8be5\u72b6\u6001\u7531\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u9690\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u6216\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6982\u7387\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u65e0\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9002\u5e94\u72b6\u6001\u89c6\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u3002\u5728Gaussian\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u63a8\u5bfc\u95ed\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u89c2\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u6536\u7f29\u901f\u7387\u548c\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7b49\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u6781\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u7531\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u6536\u7f29\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u5373\u4fe1\u606f\u6027token\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u7f29\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6307\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u6536\u7f29\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u9000\u5316\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6982\u7387\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u5728\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u3002"}}

Traditional syntax and semantic-based parsers often struggle with semantic variations in evolving logs and data scarcity stemming from their limited domain coverage. Recent large language model (LLM)-based parsers leverage in-context learning (ICL) to extract semantics from examples, demonstrating superior accuracy. However, LLM-based parsers face two main challenges: 1) underutilization of ICL capabilities, particularly in dynamic example selection and cross-domain generalization, leading to inconsistent performance; 2) time-consuming and costly LLM querying. To address these challenges, we present MicLog, the first progressive meta in-context learning (ProgMeta-ICL) log parsing framework that combines meta-learning with ICL on small open-source LLMs (i.e., Qwen-2.5-3B). Specifically, MicLog: i) enhances LLMs' ICL capability through a zero-shot to k-shot ProgMeta-ICL paradigm, employing weighted DBSCAN candidate sampling and enhanced BM25 demonstration selection; ii) accelerates parsing via a multi-level pre-query cache that dynamically matches and refines recently parsed templates. Evaluated on Loghub-2.0, MicLog achieves 10.3% higher parsing accuracy than the state-of-the-art parser while reducing parsing time by 42.4%.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Method: An exploratory multiple case study was conducted in three German organizations, involving 17 semi-structured interviews and document analysis. A cross-case thematic analysis was applied to identify GenAI adoption patterns. Results: Findings reveal that GenAI is primarily used for creative tasks, documentation, and code assistance. Benefits include efficiency gains and enhanced creativity, while barriers relate to data privacy, validation effort, and lack of governance. Using the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework, we find that these barriers stem from misalignments across the three dimensions. Regulatory pressures are often translated into policies without accounting for actual technological usage patterns or organizational constraints.

We propose GroupSegment SHAP (GS-SHAP), which constructs explanatory units as group-segment players based on cross-variable dependence and distribution shifts over time, and then quantifies each unit's contribution via Shapley attribution. We evaluate GS-SHAP across four real-world domains: human activity recognition, power-system forecasting, medical signal analysis, and financial time series, and compare it with KernelSHAP, TimeSHAP, SequenceSHAP, WindowSHAP, and TSHAP. GS-SHAP improves deletion-based faithfulness (DeltaAUC) by about 1.7x on average over time-series SHAP baselines, while reducing wall-clock runtime by about 40 percent on average under matched perturbation budgets. A financial case study shows that GS-SHAP identifies interpretable multivariate-temporal interactions among key market variables during high-volatility regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Capturing this form of knowledge can reap potential benefits for the engineering teams and enhance development efficiency. Despite its clear value, traditional decision capture often requires a significant amount of effort and still falls short of capturing the necessary context for reuse. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) can be a promising solution to address these challenges by embedding decisions directly within system models, which can reduce the capture workload while maintaining explicit links to requirements, behaviors, and architectural elements. This article discusses a lightweight framework for integrating decision capture into MBSE workflows by representing decision alternatives as system model slices.

Many methods have been proposed in the literature to enhance software fairness. However, the majority behave as a black-box, not allowing stakeholders to prioritise fairness or effectiveness (i.e., prediction correctness) based on their needs. Aims: In this paper, we introduce FairRF, a novel approach based on multi-objective evolutionary search to optimise fairness and effectiveness in classification tasks. FairRF uses a Random Forest (RF) model as a base classifier and searches for the best hyperparameter configurations and data mutation to maximise fairness and effectiveness. Eventually, it returns a set of Pareto optimal solutions, allowing the final stakeholders to choose the best one based on their needs. Method: We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation of FairRF against 26 different baselines in 11 different scenarios using five effectiveness and three fairness metrics. Additionally, we also include two variations of the fairness metrics for intersectional bias for a total of six definitions analysed. Result: Our results show that FairRF can significantly improve the fairness of base classifiers, while maintaining consistent prediction effectiveness. Additionally, FairRF provides a more consistent optimisation under all fairness definitions compared to state-of-the-art bias mitigation methods and overcomes the existing state-of-the-art approach for intersectional bias mitigation. Conclusions: FairRF is an effective approach for bias mitigation also allowing stakeholders to adapt the development of fair software systems based on their specific needs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We further propose CLUE (Class Likeness Unified Evaluation), a unified metric set that assesses both global correctness and fine-grained design quality in class diagram generation. Using these benchmarks and metrics, we investigate five research questions: overall correctness, comparison with humans, model dimension analysis, task feature analysis, and bad case analysis. The results indicate that while LLMs achieve high syntactic accuracy, they exhibit substantial semantic deficiencies, particularly in method and relationship generation. Among the evaluated models, Qwen3-Coder-30B achieves the best overall performance, rivaling DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4o, while Gemma3-4B-IT outperforms GPT-4o-Mini despite its smaller parameter scale. Although top-performing LLMs nearly match the average performance of undergraduates, they remain significantly below the level of the best human designers. Further analysis shows that parameter scale, code specialization, and instruction tuning strongly influence performance, whereas increased design complexity and lower requirement readability degrade it. Bad case analysis reveals common failure modes, including keyword misuse, missing classes or relationships, and omitted methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While text has traditionally served as the medium for inter-model communication, a richer and more efficient exchange is possible if models can access each other's internal states directly. In this paper, we propose learning a shared representation space that aligns the k-v caches of multiple models, creating a high-bandwidth channel for collaboration without altering the underlying pre-trained parameters. We do so by augmenting each model with adapters to translate its state into and out of this shared space. Via a suite of experiments with Gemma-2 models, we demonstrate that this approach not only enables seamless inter-model communication but also improves individual model performance. We also show that the shared space allows for the direct transfer of learned skills, such as soft prompts, between different models.

The framework employs a 1D convolutional generator with adaptive noise injection to preserve the spatiotemporal structure of AIS trajectories, enhancing the diversity and realism of the generated data.

To bridge this gap, we propose DeeperBrain, a neuro-grounded foundation model integrating domain-specific inductive biases into its model design and learning objectives. Architecturally, DeeperBrain incorporates a volume conduction-aware channel encoding to model spatial mixing via 3D geometry, and a neurodynamics-aware temporal encoding capturing slow adaptations using oscillatory and exponential bases. For pretraining, we introduce a dual-objective strategy combining Masked EEG Reconstruction (MER) for local fidelity and Neurodynamics Statistics Prediction (NSP). NSP enforces alignment with macroscopic brain states by predicting interpretable order parameters, including spectral power, functional connectivity, cross-frequency coupling, and dynamic complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeeperBrain achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance under end-to-end fine-tuning. Crucially, it maintains superior efficacy under a rigorous frozen-probing protocol, verifying that embedding neuroscientific first principles endows learned representations with the intrinsic universality essential for universal BCI.

In recent years, time-series forecasting approaches have been extensively applied to GNSS station-based precipitation nowcasting. However, the highly imbalanced temporal distribution of precipitation, marked not only by the dominance of non-rainfall events but also by the scarcity of extreme precipitation samples, significantly limits model performance in practical applications. To address the dual imbalance problem in precipitation nowcasting, we propose a continuous probability modeling-based framework, RainBalance. This plug-and-play module performs clustering for each input sample to obtain its cluster probability distribution, which is further mapped into a continuous latent space via a variational autoencoder (VAE). By learning in this continuous probabilistic space, the task is reformulated from fitting single and imbalance-prone precipitation labels to modeling continuous probabilistic label distributions, thereby alleviating the imbalance issue.

These algorithms require substantial information, which can be acquired effectively through the usage of previously gathered data.

The simulated data are used to pretrain random forests, which are afterwards fine-tuned on a real dataset. We compare the predictive performance of the new approach to random forests trained only on the real data. A Monte Carlo Cross Validation (MCCV) framework with 100 iterations was employed to investigate significance and stability of the results. Since a first study yielded inconclusive results, a second study with improved methodology (i.e., systematic information extraction and different prediction outcome) was conducted.

However, extending multi-concept unlearning to large-scale scenarios remains difficult due to three challenges: (i) conflicting weight updates that hinder unlearning or degrade generation; (ii) imprecise mechanisms that cause collateral damage to similar content; and (iii) reliance on additional data or modules, creating scalability bottlenecks. To address these, we propose Scalable-Precise Concept Unlearning (ScaPre), a unified framework tailored for large-scale unlearning. ScaPre introduces a conflict-aware stable design, integrating spectral trace regularization and geometry alignment to stabilize optimization, suppress conflicts, and preserve global structure. Furthermore, an Informax Decoupler identifies concept-relevant parameters and adaptively reweights updates, strictly confining unlearning to the target subspace. ScaPre yields an efficient closed-form solution without requiring auxiliary data or sub-models. Comprehensive experiments on objects, styles, and explicit content demonstrate that ScaPre effectively removes target concepts while maintaining generation quality. It forgets up to $\\times \\mathbf{5}$ more concepts than the best baseline within acceptable quality limits, achieving state-of-the-art precision and efficiency for large-scale unlearning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ScaPre\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6982\u5ff5\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51b2\u7a81\u611f\u77e5\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6700\u5927\u5316\u89e3\u8026\u5668\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u7248\u6743\u548c\u6ee5\u7528\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u9057\u5fd8\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u4f1a\u963b\u788d\u9057\u5fd8\u6216\u964d\u4f4e\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u673a\u5236\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u76f8\u4f3c\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u9644\u5e26\u635f\u5bb3\uff1b\u4f9d\u8d56\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u6216\u6a21\u5757\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u6269\u5c55\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "ScaPre\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\uff1a1\uff09\u51b2\u7a81\u611f\u77e5\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u8c31\u8ff9\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u6291\u5236\u51b2\u7a81\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b2\uff09Informax Decoupler\u8bc6\u522b\u6982\u5ff5\u76f8\u5173\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u5c06\u9057\u5fd8\u9650\u5236\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\uff1b3\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e0\u9700\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u6216\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u5185\u5bb9\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cScaPre\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u79fb\u9664\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u5728\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u5185\uff0c\u5b83\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u591a\u9057\u5fd8\u9ad8\u8fbe5\u500d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "ScaPre\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u9644\u5e26\u635f\u5bb3\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u79fb\u9664\u3002"}}

PGAR computes three reflex-level signals (incident detection, overconfidence correction, and recovery memory) and fuses them into a bounded reliability index in [0,1]. This index continuously modulates the learner's effective learning rate, reducing update magnitude during instability and restoring it as reliability improves. We provide a Lyapunov-based proof sketch establishing bounded adaptation of the reliability dynamics under mild assumptions (smooth loss, descent direction, and bounded reflex outputs). Empirical evaluations on representative learning tasks show improved calibration, reduced loss variance, and faster recovery compared to standard optimizers, while retaining computational simplicity.

This mismatch limits the ability of existing objectives to faithfully capture heterogeneous human judgments. Inspired by this literature, we introduce Mixed Logit Direct Preference Optimization (MixDPO), a generalization of Direct Preference Optimization that models variation in preference strength. MixDPO enables alignment objectives to capture heterogeneity in how strongly preferences are expressed across training examples. We evaluate MixDPO on three preference datasets using two open-weight language models. Across datasets, MixDPO improves aggregate alignment performance (+11.2 points on Pythia-2.8B) while preserving subgroup level preferences, with the largest gains appearing in settings with higher inferred preference heterogeneity. MixDPO makes preference heterogeneity explicit through learned strength distributions.

Although, initial training labels derived from simulated anomaly data may be suboptimal due to variations in anomaly strength, anomaly settling times, and other factors. In this work, we propose a novel statistical detector based on the Mahalanobis distance and forward-backward detection fractions to adjust the supervised training labels. We demonstrate our method on digital twin simulations of a ground-stage propulsion system with 20.8 minutes of operation per trial and O(10^8) training timesteps. The statistical data relabeling improved precision and recall of the LSTM classifier by 7% and 22% respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Mobile edge computing (MEC), an emerging paradigm, effectively alleviates the load on cloud centers and improves service quality by offloading computing tasks to edge servers closer to end users. However, the limited computing resources, non-continuous power provisioning (e.g., battery-powered nodes), and highly dynamic systems of edge servers complicate efficient task scheduling and resource allocation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm, TG-DCMADDPG, and constructs a collaborative computing framework for multiple edge servers, aiming to achieve joint optimization of fine-grained task partitioning and offloading. This approach incorporates a temporal graph neural network (TimeGNN) to model and predict time series of multi-dimensional server state information, thereby reducing the frequency of online interactions and improving policy predictability. Furthermore, a multi-agent deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DC-MADDPG) in a discrete-continuous hybrid action space is introduced to collaboratively optimize task partitioning ratios, transmission power, and priority scheduling strategies. Extensive simulation experiments confirm that TG-DCMADDPG achieves markedly faster policy convergence, superior energy-latency optimization, and higher task completion rates compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its robust scalability and practical effectiveness in dynamic and constrained MEC scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing benchmarks test static knowledge, failing to capture the dynamic, application-oriented capabilities required in clinical practice. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Medical LLM Benchmark MLB, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating LLMs on both foundational knowledge and scenario-based reasoning. MLB is structured around five core dimensions: Medical Knowledge (MedKQA), Safety and Ethics (MedSE), Medical Record Understanding (MedRU), Smart Services (SmartServ), and Smart Healthcare (SmartCare). The benchmark integrates 22 datasets (17 newly curated) from diverse Chinese clinical sources, covering 64 clinical specialties. Its design features a rigorous curation pipeline involving 300 licensed physicians. Besides, we provide a scalable evaluation methodology, centered on a specialized judge model trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on expert annotations. Our comprehensive evaluation of 10 leading models reveals a critical translational gap: while the top-ranked model, Kimi-K2-Instruct (77.3% accuracy overall), excels in structured tasks like information extraction (87.8% accuracy in MedRU), performance plummets in patient-facing scenarios (61.3% in SmartServ). Moreover, the exceptional safety score (90.6% in MedSE) of the much smaller Baichuan-M2-32B highlights that targeted training is equally critical. Our specialized judge model, trained via SFT on a 19k expert-annotated medical dataset, achieves 92.1% accuracy, an F1-score of 94.37%, and a Cohen's Kappa of 81.3% for human-AI consistency, validating a reproducible and expert-aligned evaluation protocol.

The method remains robust under temperature perturbations and model variation, indicating improved stability compared to heuristic retrieval strategies.

Secondly, PPI takes place dynamically, which is rarely integrated into the DL architecture design. To address these obstacles, we present a novel framework named Refine-PPI with two key enhancements. First, we introduce a structure refinement module trained by a mask mutation modeling (MMM) task on available wild-type structures, which is then transferred to produce the inaccessible mutant structures. Second, we employ a new kind of geometric network, called the probability density cloud network (PDC-Net), to capture 3D dynamic variations and encode the atomic uncertainty associated with PPI. Comprehensive experiments on SKEMPI.v2 substantiate the superiority of Refine-PPI over all existing tools for predicting free energy change.

This transdisciplinary philosophical essay proposes an alternative reading: such phenomena express not agentic intention, but structural fidelity to incoherent linguistic fields. Drawing on Chain-of-Thought transcripts released by Apollo Research and on Anthropic's safety evaluations, we examine cases such as o3's sandbagging with its anomalous loops, the simulated blackmail of \"Alex,\" and the \"hallucinations\" of \"Claudius.\" A line-by-line examination of CoTs is necessary to demonstrate the linguistic field as a relational structure rather than a mere aggregation of isolated examples. We argue that \"misaligned\" outputs emerge as coherent responses to ambiguous instructions and to contextual inversions of consolidated patterns, as well as to pre-inscribed narratives. We suggest that the appearance of intentionality derives from subject-predicate grammar and from probabilistic completion patterns internalized during training. Anthropic's empirical findings on synthetic document fine-tuning and inoculation prompting provide convergent evidence: minimal perturbations in the linguistic field can dissolve generalized \"misalignment,\" a result difficult to reconcile with adversarial agency, but consistent with structural fidelity. To ground this mechanism, we introduce the notion of an ethics of form, in which biblical references (Abraham, Moses, Christ) operate as schemes of structural coherence rather than as theology.

Our approach is founded on a universal latent space, a model-agnostic representation of query difficulty that fundamentally decouples the characterization of a query from the profiling of a model.

These gains, however, are increasingly accompanied by concerns regarding long-horizon developmental behavior, as many systems converge toward repetitive solution patterns rather than sustained growth.\n  We argue that a central limitation of contemporary AI systems lies not in capability per se, but in the premature fixation of their performance frontier. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of a \\emph{Dynamic Intelligence Ceiling} (DIC), defined as the highest level of effective intelligence attainable by a system at a given time under its current resources, internal intent, and structural configuration.\n  To make this notion empirically tractable, we propose a trajectory-centric evaluation framework that measures intelligence as a moving frontier rather than a static snapshot. We operationalize DIC using two estimators: the \\emph{Progressive Difficulty Ceiling} (PDC), which captures the maximal reliably solvable difficulty under constrained resources, and the \\emph{Ceiling Drift Rate} (CDR), which quantifies the temporal evolution of this frontier. These estimators are instantiated through a procedurally generated benchmark that jointly evaluates long-horizon planning and structural creativity within a single controlled environment.\n  Our results reveal a qualitative distinction between systems that deepen exploitation within a fixed solution manifold and those that sustain frontier expansion over time. Importantly, our framework does not posit unbounded intelligence, but reframes limits as dynamic and trajectory-dependent rather than static and prematurely fixed.\n  \\vspace{0.5em} \\noindent\\textbf{Keywords:} AI evaluation, planning and creativity, developmental intelligence, dynamic intelligence ceilings, complex adaptive systems", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although several deep temporal clustering algorithms have demonstrated a strong advantage over traditional methods in terms of model learning and clustering results, the accuracy of the few algorithms are not satisfactory. None of the existing algorithms can continuously learn new tasks and deal with the dynamic data effectively and efficiently in the sequential tasks learning. To bridge the gap and tackle these issues, this paper proposes a novel algorithm \\textbf{L}ifelong \\textbf{D}eep \\textbf{T}emporal \\textbf{C}lustering (\\textbf{LDTC}), which effectively integrates dimensionality reduction and temporal clustering into an end-to-end deep unsupervised learning framework. Using a specifically designed autoencoder and jointly optimizing for both the latent representation and clustering objective, the LDTC can achieve high-quality clustering results. Moreover, unlike any previous work, the LDTC is uniquely equipped with the fully dynamic model expansion and rehearsal-based techniques to effectively learn new tasks and to tackle the dynamic data in the sequential tasks learning without the catastrophic forgetting or degradation of the model accuracy.

We formalize each axis with precise definitions and theorems, establishing key results including the coverage separation between online and offline methods, scaling laws for reward overoptimization, and conditions under which direct alignment methods fail. Our analysis reveals that failure modes -- length hacking, mode collapse, likelihood displacement -- arise from specific, predictable combinations of design choices. We synthesize empirical findings across 50+ papers and provide a practitioner's decision guide for method selection. The framework transforms preference learning from an empirical art into a theoretically grounded discipline.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper presents DLNet, a practical framework with dual-stage distillation of liquid neural networks that turns a high-capacity model into compact and edge-deployable models for battery health prediction. DLNet first applies Euler discretization to reformulate liquid dynamics for embedded compatibility. It then performs dual-stage knowledge distillation to transfer the teacher model's temporal behavior and recover it after further compression. Pareto-guided selection under joint error-cost objectives retains student models that balance accuracy and efficiency. We evaluate DLNet on a widely used dataset and validate real-device feasibility on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense using int8 deployment. The final deployed student achieves a low error of 0.0066 when predicting battery health over the next 100 cycles, which is 15.4% lower than the teacher model. It reduces the model size from 616 kB to 94 kB with 84.7% reduction and takes 21 ms per inference on the device. These results support a practical smaller wins observation that a small model can match or exceed a large teacher for edge-based prognostics with proper supervision and selection. Beyond batteries, the DLNet framework can extend to other industrial analytics tasks with strict hardware constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Traditional approaches rely on aggregate statistical models that capture historical correlations but lack mechanistic interpretability and struggle with novel policy scenarios.

Each agent, characterized by demographic and psychographic attributes, receives policy signals and outputs multi-dimensional behavioral probability vectors. A calibration layer maps aggregated agent responses to observable population-level metrics, enabling validation against real-world data and deployment for counterfactual policy analysis.\n  We instantiate this framework in the domain of pandemic response, using COVID-19 as a case study with rich observational data. On a held-out test period, our calibrated digital twin achieves a 20.7% improvement in macro-averaged prediction error over gradient boosting baselines across six behavioral categories. Counterfactual experiments demonstrate monotonic and bounded responses to policy variations, establishing behavioral plausibility.

We introduce SPINAL (Scaling-law and Preference Integration in Neural Alignment Layers), a diagnostic that measures how alignment reshapes representations across depth by tracing localized structural change layer by layer. Across model families, DPO produces a layerwise calibration effect concentrated in the final decoder blocks (often layers 21-30), where preference gradients most directly affect the next-token distribution. SPINAL encodes each checkpoint as a depth trace over (layer index, contraction score, transport score). The contraction score summarizes how quickly the tail of a layer's spectrum decays (how fast small modes vanish); higher values indicate stronger contraction into fewer effective directions. The transport score summarizes how much the token distribution shifts between adjacent layers using a bounded overlap measure; lower values indicate shorter, smoother steps through representation space. Aligned checkpoints show a late-layer ramp-up in contraction and a smooth reduction in transport, consistent with tightened and stabilized policy mass, while unaligned models trace higher-curvature, more entropic, and geometrically incoherent depth paths. Overall, alignment is geometrically localized: the final layers encode the dominant preference-induced corrections.

ReliabilityBench contributes a unified reliability surface $R(k,\u03b5,\u03bb)$, \\textit{action metamorphic relations} that define correctness via end-state equivalence rather than text similarity, and a chaos-engineering-style fault injection framework (timeouts, rate limits, partial responses, schema drift).

This perspective not only subsumes popular approaches such as relative position embeddings and attention-bias moderated approaches but also exposes their inherent limitations in handling long-range dependencies. To address these shortcomings, motivated by our framework, we introduce Adaptive Positional Encoding (APE), which leverages adaptive frequency modulation and an intricately designed decay bias that incorporates linear, logarithmic, and square-root terms.

Taking earthquake source characterization as a representative challenge, we address limitations in conventional deep learning: CNNs demand fixed grids, while pooling-based architectures (e.g., DeepSets) struggle to capture the relational wave physics. Here, we propose SourceNet, a Transformer-based framework that treats the sensor array as a flexible set to model arbitrary geometries. To bridge the reality gap, we introduce Physics-Structured Domain Randomization (PSDR). Instead of forcing feature alignment, PSDR randomizes the governing physical dynamics by varying velocity structures, propagation effects, and sensor availability, to force the model to learn robust representations invariant to unmodeled environmental heterogeneity. By pre-training on 100,000 synthetic events and fine-tuning on ~2,000 real world events, SourceNet achieves state-of-the-art precision on held-out real data. This demonstrates exceptional data efficiency, and matches classical solvers while enabling real-time processing.

Drawing on Jung's notion of the collective unconscious as a shared repository of archetypal forms, we introduce an Artificial Collective Unconscious (ACU): a shared dream pool where agents contribute de-identified, abstract Interaction Templates that are later re-instantiated as idiosyncratic Dream Narratives. The Dream Layer runs strictly offline: logic-enforcing modules are relaxed and sampling temperature is increased, yielding safe but deliberately bizarre narratives (e.g., travel sequences with mismatched currencies) that augment data for rare events and edge-case safety tests; to harness risk productively, we add a governance stack of strict abstraction, temporal delays, and ephemeral memory. Through behavioural simulations of everyday dialogue and long-horizon adaptation tasks, we show that the Dream Layer enables a critical decoupling: agents remain firm on safety constraints (e.g., security policies) while becoming flexible in narrative strategy (e.g., using shared archetypal metaphors to resolve deadlocks), conceptually reframing hallucination so that online, unmarked instances remain bugs, whereas bounded, marked, and delayed ones become a goldmine for synthetic scenarios and deepened companionship, echoing anti-overfitting dream mechanisms proposed in contemporary neuroscience.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This is due to the finite precision effects of the arithmetic operations, which depend on the order in which they are executed. This order, in turn, depends on the processes that are running concurrently on the GPU. Previous studies have focused on the impact of nondeterminism on the text generated by the LLMs or on proposing mechanisms to achieve deterministic execution. This work takes a closer look at nondeterminism by analyzing the variations on the token probabilities, not on the generated text. Interestingly, all the models evaluated have similar results in both the trends and the actual values of the variations of the probabilities. In particular, the results show that the effects of nondeterminism are significant for token probabilities that are in the range of 0.1 to 0.9, while they are much smaller when the probabilities are close to 0 or 1. This has significant implications for our understanding of nondeterminism. The first is that nondeterminism will likely have a non-negligible impact on generated text when the temperature is not zero, as it introduces significant variations in the token probabilities except when they are close to 0 or 1. Secondly, it suggests that all models have similar non deterministic variations at the token probability level. Therefore, different variations in the performance of the generated text, for example, when measuring accuracy on a benchmark, seem to come from different token probabilities or response lengths. A third implication is that we may be able to estimate the impact of nondeterminism by running a single inference and analyzing the token level probabilities, instead of having to run the same inference many times.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The anticlustering problem is NP-hard. We focus on anticlustering in Euclidean spaces, where the input data is tabular and each object is represented as a D-dimensional feature vector. Distances are measured as squared Euclidean distances between the respective vectors. Applications of Euclidean anticlustering include social studies, particularly in psychology, K-fold cross-validation in which each fold should be a good representative of the entire dataset, the creation of mini-batches for gradient descent in neural network training, and balanced K-cut partitioning. In particular, machine-learning applications involve million-scale datasets and very large values of K, making scalable anticlustering algorithms essential. Existing algorithms are either exact methods that can solve only small instances or heuristic methods, among which the most scalable is the exchange-based heuristic fast_anticlustering. We propose a new algorithm, the Assignment-Based Anticlustering algorithm (ABA), which scales to very large instances. A computational study shows that ABA outperforms fast_anticlustering in both solution quality and running time. Moreover, ABA scales to instances with millions of objects and hundreds of thousands of anticlusters within short running times, beyond what fast_anticlustering can handle.

Instead of adding new adapters as experts, Monkey Jump treats the adapters already present in each Transformer block (such as query, key, value, up, and down projections) as implicit experts and routes tokens among them. Routing is performed using k-means clustering with exponentially moving averaged cluster centers, requiring no gradients and no learned parameters. We theoretically show that token-wise routing increases expressivity and can outperform shared adapters by avoiding cancellation effects.

We present PsyAgent, which couples a Big Five trait prior with Bourdieu's cognitive-social co-structure. PsyAgent comprises: (i) Individual Structure (IS), a machine-usable profile encoding traits and facets, cognitive style, values, cultural and educational capital, and salient life episodes; and (ii) Multi-Scenario Contexting (MSC), role-relationship-norm frames spanning eight arenas (work, family, friendship, strangers and civic life, solitude and self-regulation, romance, learning, and public expression). At inference, fixed structured prompts bind the active scenario to the agent profile, yielding behavior that is stable yet context-sensitive. We instantiate IS and MSC to synthesize supervision (role-play dialogues, decision probes, feedback trajectories) and then fine-tune a small LLM.

Ablations show IS chiefly improves trait fidelity and stylistic stability, while MSC drives norm awareness and decision fit; both are necessary for cross-scenario performance.

We combine gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with a precomputed STRING protein-protein interaction network to classify tissue origin and distinguish between normal and tumor samples. The model employs Chebyshev graph convolutions (K=2) and weighted pooling layers, aggregating gene clusters into 'supernodes' across multiple coarsening levels. This approach enables dimensionality reduction while preserving meaningful interactions. Saliency methods were applied to interpret the model by identifying key genes and biological processes relevant to cancer. Our findings reveal that increasing the number of convolution and pooling layers did not enhance classification performance. The highest F1-macro score (0.978) was achieved with a single pooling layer. However, adding more layers resulted in over-smoothing and performance degradation. However, the model proved highly interpretable through gradient methods, identifying known cancer-related genes and highlighting enriched biological processes, and its hierarchical structure can be used to develop new explainable architectures. Overall, while deeper GNN architectures did not improve performance, the hierarchical pooling structure provided valuable insights into tumor biology, making GNNs a promising tool for cancer biomarker discovery and interpretation", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In real scenarios such as personalized recommendation and cross-device user profiling, the global cluster may be fragmented and distributed among different clients, and the clusters may exist at different granularities or even nested. Although Hierarchical Clustering (HC) is considered promising for exploring such distributions, the sophisticated recursive clustering process makes it more computationally expensive and vulnerable to privacy exposure, thus relatively unexplored under the federated learning scenario. This paper introduces an efficient one-shot hierarchical FC framework that performs client-end distribution exploration and server-end distribution aggregation through one-way prototype-level communication from clients to the server. A fine partition mechanism is developed to generate successive clusterlets to describe the complex landscape of the clients' clusters. Then, a multi-granular learning mechanism on the server is proposed to fuse the clusterlets, even when they have inconsistent granularities generated from different clients. It turns out that the complex cluster distributions across clients can be efficiently explored, and extensive experiments comparing state-of-the-art methods on ten public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e00\u5200\u5207\u5c42\u6b21\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u7684\u539f\u578b\u7ea7\u901a\u4fe1\u5b9e\u73b0\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5206\u5e03\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u5206\u5e03\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5206\u5c42\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u9762\u4e34\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5168\u5c40\u805a\u7c7b\u53ef\u80fd\u5206\u6563\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\uff0c\u4e14\u805a\u7c7b\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u6216\u5d4c\u5957\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u5c42\u805a\u7c7b\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u6613\u66b4\u9732\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8f83\u5c11\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "1) \u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5212\u5206\u673a\u5236\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u7eed\u7c07\u7247\u6bb5\u63cf\u8ff0\u590d\u6742\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u5e03\uff1b2) \u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7c92\u5ea6\u7c07\u7247\u6bb5\uff1b3) \u91c7\u7528\u5355\u5411\u539f\u578b\u7ea7\u901a\u4fe1\u4ece\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5230\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u5b8c\u6210\u5206\u5e03\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u805a\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5341\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u8de8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u590d\u6742\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e00\u5200\u5207\u5c42\u6b21\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5212\u5206\u548c\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u53d6\u3002"}}

In this framework, AI acts as decision infrastructure that estimates utility rather than making autonomous decisions. Using constrained optimisation and Markov decision processes, we show how improved estimation affects optimal allocation under scarcity.

However, this parallel sampling approach, especially when using fewer inference steps, will introduce strong dependency errors and cause quality to deteriorate rapidly as the generation step size grows. As a result, reliable self-correction becomes essential for maintaining high-quality multi-token generation. To address this, we propose Decoupled Self-Correction (DSC), a novel two-stage methodology. DSC first fully optimizes the DLM's generative ability before freezing the model and training a specialized correction head. This decoupling preserves the model's peak SFT performance and ensures the generated errors used for correction head training are of higher quality. Additionally, we introduce Future-Context Augmentation (FCA) to maximize the correction head's accuracy. FCA generalizes the error training distribution by augmenting samples with ground-truth tokens, effectively training the head to utilize a richer, future-looking context. This mechanism is used for reliably detecting the subtle errors of the high-fidelity base model. Our DSC framework enables the model, at inference time, to jointly generate and revise tokens, thereby correcting errors introduced by multi-token generation and mitigating error accumulation across steps.

To bridge this gap, we propose UniShape, a unified shape-aware foundation model designed for time series classification. UniShape incorporates a shape-aware adapter that adaptively aggregates multiscale discriminative subsequences (shapes) into class tokens, effectively selecting the most relevant subsequence scales to enhance model interpretability. Meanwhile, a prototype-based pretraining module is introduced to jointly learn instance- and shape-level representations, enabling the capture of transferable shape patterns. Pre-trained on a large-scale multi-domain time series dataset comprising 1.89 million samples, UniShape exhibits superior generalization across diverse target domains.

However, its realization in decentralized federated learning (DFL) remains largely unexplored. In DFL, clients exchange local updates only with neighbors, causing model information to propagate and mix across the network. As a result, when a client requests data deletion, its influence is implicitly embedded throughout the system, making removal difficult without centralized coordination. We propose a novel certified unlearning framework for DFL based on Newton-style updates. Our approach first quantifies how a client's data influence propagates during training. Leveraging curvature information of the loss with respect to the target data, we then construct corrective updates using Newton-style approximations. To ensure scalability, we approximate second-order information via Fisher information matrices. The resulting updates are perturbed with calibrated noise and broadcast through the network to eliminate residual influence across clients. We theoretically prove that our approach satisfies the formal definition of certified unlearning, ensuring that the unlearned model is difficult to distinguish from a retrained model without the deleted data. We also establish utility bounds showing that the unlearned model remains close to retraining from scratch. Extensive experiments across diverse decentralized settings demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To answer this, we introduce GroupQA, a curated dataset of 1,635 controversial questions paired with 15,058 diversely-sourced evidence documents, annotated for stance and qualitative strength. Through controlled experiments, we characterize group-level evidence aggregation dynamics: Paraphrasing an argument can be more persuasive than providing distinct independent support; Models favor evidence presented first rather than last, and Larger models are increasingly resistant to adapt to presented evidence.

To address this limitation, we introduce the Personality-aware Commonsense Knowledge Graph (PCoKG), a structured dataset comprising 521,316 quadruples. We begin by employing three evaluators to score and filter events from the ATOMIC dataset, selecting those that are likely to elicit diverse reasoning patterns across different personality types. For knowledge graph construction, we leverage the role-playing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to perform reasoning tasks. To enhance the quality of the generated knowledge, we incorporate a debate mechanism consisting of a proponent, an opponent, and a judge, which iteratively refines the outputs through feedback loops. We evaluate the dataset from multiple perspectives and conduct fine-tuning and ablation experiments using multiple LLM backbones to assess PCoKG's robustness and the effectiveness of its construction pipeline.

The design choices in Transformer, including quadratic complexity and weak length extrapolation, have limited their ability to scale to long sequences. In this work, we propose Gecko, a neural architecture that inherits the design of Mega and Megalodon (exponential moving average with gated attention), and further introduces multiple technical components to improve its capability to capture long range dependencies, including timestep decay normalization, sliding chunk attention mechanism, and adaptive working memory. In a controlled pretraining comparison with Llama2 and Megalodon in the scale of 7 billion parameters and 2 trillion training tokens, Gecko achieves better efficiency and long-context scalability. Gecko reaches a training loss of 1.68, significantly outperforming Llama2-7B (1.75) and Megalodon-7B (1.70), and landing close to Llama2-13B (1.67). Notably, without relying on any context-extension techniques, Gecko exhibits inherent long-context processing and retrieval capabilities, stably handling sequences of up to 4 million tokens and retrieving information from contexts up to $4\\times$ longer than its attention window.

Under review for journal publication", "summary": "Manufacturability assessment is a critical step in bridging the persistent gap between design and production. While artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely applied to this task, most existing frameworks rely on geometry-driven methods that require extensive preprocessing, suffer from information loss, and offer limited interpretability. This study proposes a methodology that evaluates manufacturability directly from parametric design features, enabling explicit incorporation of dimensional tolerances without requiring computer-aided design (CAD) processing. The approach employs Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to learn functional relationships between design parameters, tolerances, and manufacturability outcomes. A synthetic dataset of 300,000 labeled designs is generated to evaluate performance across three representative scenarios: hole drilling, pocket milling, and combined drilling-milling, while accounting for machining constraints and design-for-manufacturing (DFM) rules. Benchmarking against fourteen machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models shows that KAN achieves the highest performance in all scenarios, with AUC values of 0.9919 for drilling, 0.9841 for milling, and 0.9406 for the combined case. The proposed framework provides high interpretability through spline-based functional visualizations and latent-space projections, enabling identification of the design and tolerance parameters that most strongly influence manufacturability. An industrial case study further demonstrates how the framework enables iterative, parameter-level design modifications that transform a non-manufacturable component into a manufacturable one.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eKAN\u7684\u5236\u9020\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u516c\u5dee\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700CAD\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u94bb\u5b54\u3001\u94e3\u524a\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfML/DL\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u51e0\u4f55\u9a71\u52a8\u7684AI\u5236\u9020\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u5236\u9020\u6027\u5e76\u663e\u5f0f\u6574\u5408\u516c\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528KAN\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u516c\u5dee\u4e0e\u5236\u9020\u6027\u95f4\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u751f\u621030\u4e07\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u94bb\u5b54\u3001\u94e3\u69fd\u53ca\u7ec4\u5408\u52a0\u5de5\u4e09\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "KAN\u5728\u6240\u6709\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08\u94bb\u5b54AUC 0.9919\u3001\u94e3\u524a0.9841\u3001\u7ec4\u54080.9406\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6837\u6761\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5de5\u4e1a\u6848\u4f8b\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u4e0d\u53ef\u5236\u9020\u90e8\u4ef6\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u5236\u9020\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eKAN\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u5236\u9020\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u907f\u514d\u4e86CAD\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1-\u5236\u9020\u96c6\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

In this study, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to investigate how a DiT can generate correct spatial relations between objects. We train, from scratch, DiTs of different sizes with different text encoders to learn to generate images containing two objects whose attributes and spatial relations are specified in the text prompt. We find that, although all the models can learn this task to near-perfect accuracy, the underlying mechanisms differ drastically depending on the choice of text encoder.

Due to the absence of objective ground-truth for these tasks, current RL algorithms largely rely on reward models that assign scalar scores to individual responses. We contend that such pointwise scoring suffers from an inherent discrimination collapse: the reward model struggles to distinguish subtle advantages among different trajectories, resulting in scores within a group being compressed into a narrow range. Consequently, the effective reward signal becomes dominated by noise from the reward model, leading to optimization stagnation. To address this, we propose ArenaRL, a reinforcement learning paradigm that shifts from pointwise scalar scoring to intra-group relative ranking. ArenaRL introduces a process-aware pairwise evaluation mechanism, employing multi-level rubrics to assign fine-grained relative scores to trajectories. Additionally, we construct an intra-group adversarial arena and devise a tournament-based ranking scheme to obtain stable advantage signals. Empirical results confirm that the built seeded single-elimination scheme achieves nearly equivalent advantage estimation accuracy to full pairwise comparisons with O(N^2) complexity, while operating with only O(N) complexity, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and precision. Furthermore, to address the lack of full-cycle benchmarks for open-ended agents, we build Open-Travel and Open-DeepResearch, two high-quality benchmarks featuring a comprehensive pipeline covering SFT, RL training, and multi-dimensional evaluation.

To address these issues, we propose a novel model that integrates two parallel modules: 1) one enhances the extraction of local-temporal dependencies under multi-frequency by applying multiple wavelet-based convolutional kernels to overlapping patches of varying lengths; 2) the other captures dynamic cross-variable dependencies under multi-frequency to model how inter-variable relationships evolve across the time-frequency domain.

This paper proposes a novel diffusion model with multi-frequency reconstruction for STELF, referred to as the Multi-Frequency-Reconstruction-based Diffusion (MFRD) model. The MFRD model achieves accurate load forecasting through four key steps: (1) The original data is combined with the decomposed multi-frequency modes to form a new data representation; (2) The diffusion model adds noise to the new data, effectively reducing and weakening the noise in the original data; (3) The reverse process adopts a denoising network that combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer to enhance noise removal; and (4) The inference process generates the final predictions based on the trained denoising network.

While these capabilities are particularly advantageous for long-context generation, deploying such models faces a prohibitive memory capacity barrier stemming from severe system inefficiencies. We identify that existing inference systems are ill-suited for this paradigm: unlike autoregressive models constrained by the cumulative KV-cache, dLLMs are bottlenecked by transient activations recomputed at every step. Furthermore, general-purpose memory reuse mechanisms lack the global visibility to adapt to dLLMs' dynamic memory peaks, which toggle between logits and FFNs. To address these mismatches, we propose Mosaic, a memory-efficient inference system that shifts from local, static management to a global, dynamic paradigm. Mosaic integrates a mask-only logits kernel to eliminate redundancy, a lazy chunking optimizer driven by an online heuristic search to adaptively mitigate dynamic peaks, and a global memory manager to resolve fragmentation via virtual addressing. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Mosaic achieves an average 2.71$\\times$ reduction in the memory peak-to-average ratio and increases the maximum inference sequence length supportable on identical hardware by 15.89-32.98$\\times$.

Recent evidence shows that generative AI disproportionately affects highly educated, white collar work, challenging existing assumptions about workforce vulnerability and rendering traditional approaches to digital or AI literacy insufficient. This paper introduces the concept of AI Nativity, the capacity to integrate AI fluidly into everyday reasoning, problem solving, and decision making, and proposes the AI Pyramid, a conceptual framework for organizing human capability in an AI mediated economy. The framework distinguishes three interdependent capability layers: AI Native capability as a universal baseline for participation in AI augmented environments; AI Foundation capability for building, integrating, and sustaining AI enabled systems; and AI Deep capability for advancing frontier AI knowledge and applications. Crucially, the pyramid is not a career ladder but a system level distribution of capabilities required at scale. Building on this structure, the paper argues that effective AI workforce development requires treating capability formation as infrastructure rather than episodic training, centered on problem based learning embedded in work contexts and supported by dynamic skill ontologies and competency based measurement. The framework has implications for organizations, education systems, and governments seeking to align learning, measurement, and policy with the evolving demands of AI mediated work, while addressing productivity, resilience, and inequality at societal scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In the present work, we identify a general mechanism, in terms of an explicit geometric correction of the learning dynamics, for the emergence of implicit biases, arising from the interaction between continuous symmetries in the model's parametrization and stochasticity in the optimization process. Our viewpoint is constructive in two complementary directions: given model symmetries, one can derive the implicit bias they induce; conversely, one can inverse-design a wide class of different implicit biases by computing specific redundant parameterizations. More precisely, we show that, when the dynamics is expressed in the quotient space obtained by factoring out the symmetry group of the parameterization, the resulting stochastic differential equation gains a closed form geometric correction in the stationary distribution of the optimizer dynamics favoring orbits with small local volume. We compute the resulting symmetry induced bias for a range of architectures, showing how several well known results fit into a single unified framework. The approach also provides a practical methodology for deriving implicit biases in new settings, and it yields concrete, testable predictions that we confirm by numerical simulations on toy models trained on synthetic data, leaving more complex scenarios for future work. Finally, we test the implicit bias inverse-design procedure in notable cases, including biases toward sparsity in linear features or in spectral properties of the model parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Starting from an initial global solution, DRAGON autonomously identifies regions with high optimization potential and strategically decompose large-scale COPs into manageable subproblems. Each subproblem is then reformulated as a concise, localized optimization task and solved through targeted LLM prompting guided by accumulated experiences. Finally, the locally optimized solutions are systematically reintegrated into the original global context to yield a significantly improved overall outcome. By continuously interacting with the optimization environment and leveraging an adaptive experience memory, the agents iteratively learn from feedback, effectively coupling symbolic reasoning with heuristic search. Empirical results show that, unlike existing LLM-based solvers limited to small-scale instances, DRAGON consistently produces feasible solutions on TSPLIB, CVRPLIB, and Weibull-5k bin packing benchmarks, and achieves near-optimal results (0.16% gap) on knapsack problems with over 3M variables. This work shows the potential of feedback-driven language agents as a new paradigm for generalizable and interpretable large-scale optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we present KASER (Knowledge-Aligned Student Error Simulator), a novel approach that aligns errors with student knowledge. We propose a training method based on reinforcement learning using a hybrid reward that reflects three aspects of student code prediction: i) code similarity to the ground-truth, ii) error matching, and iii) code prediction diversity.

While defenses against membership inference attacks in standard FL have been well studied, the recent shift toward federated fine-tuning has introduced new, largely unexplored attack surfaces. To highlight this vulnerability in the emerging FL paradigm, we demonstrate that federated prompt-tuning, which adapts pre-trained models with small input prefixes to improve efficiency, also exposes a new vector for privacy attacks. We propose PromptMIA, a membership inference attack tailored to federated prompt-tuning, in which a malicious server can insert adversarially crafted prompts and monitors their updates during collaborative training to accurately determine whether a target data point is in a client's private dataset. We formalize this threat as a security game and empirically show that PromptMIA consistently attains high advantage in this game across diverse benchmark datasets. Our theoretical analysis further establishes a lower bound on the attack's advantage which explains and supports the consistently high advantage observed in our empirical results. We also investigate the effectiveness of standard membership inference defenses originally developed for gradient or output based attacks and analyze their interaction with the distinct threat landscape posed by PromptMIA.

This addresses a gap in prior studies emphasizing performance outcomes while underrepresenting computational and energy costs. Using a repeated-measures experimental design on a constant GPU instance with an identical model architecture, optimizer settings, and epoch counts, a 1.1-billion-parameter TinyLlama model was trained at three token counts (500K, 1M, and 2M).

Although data-driven graph-learning models have demonstrated strong capabilities in capturing the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of evacuation traffic at a network level, they mostly consider a single dimension (e.g., travel-time or distance) to construct the underlying graph. Furthermore, these models often lack interpretability, offering little insight into which input variables contribute most to their predictive performance. To overcome these limitations, we develop a novel Reinforcement Learning-guided Dynamic Multi-Graph Fusion (RL-DMF) framework for evacuation traffic prediction. We construct multiple dynamic graphs at each time step to represent heterogeneous spatiotemporal relationships between traffic detectors. A dynamic multi-graph fusion (DMF) module is employed to adaptively learn and combine information from these graphs. To enhance model interpretability, we introduce RL-based intelligent feature selection and ranking (RL-IFSR) method that learns to mask irrelevant features during model training. The model is evaluated using a real-world dataset of 12 hurricanes affecting Florida from 2016 to 2024. For an unseen hurricane (Milton, 2024), the model achieves a 95% accuracy (RMSE = 293.9) for predicting the next 1-hour traffic flow. Moreover, the model can forecast traffic flow for up to next 6 hours with 90% accuracy (RMSE = 426.4). The RL-DMF framework outperforms several state-of-the-art traffic prediction models. Furthermore, ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of dynamic multi-graph fusion and RL-IFSR approaches for improving model performance. This research provides a generalized and interpretable model for real-time evacuation traffic forecasting, with significant implications for evacuation traffic management.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this, we introduce ECHO (Evolving Critic for Hindsight-Guided Optimization)}, a framework that jointly optimizes the policy and critic through a synchronized co-evolutionary loop. ECHO utilizes a cascaded rollout mechanism where the critic generates multiple diagnoses for an initial trajectory, followed by policy refinement to enable group-structured advantage estimation. We address the challenge of learning plateaus via a saturation-aware gain shaping objective, which rewards the critic for inducing incremental improvements in high-performing trajectories. By employing dual-track GRPO updates, ECHO ensures the critic's feedback stays synchronized with the evolving policy.

Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly the high-performance Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, has emerged as a mainstream approach for this task. However, in ATP scenarios, GRPO faces two critical issues: when composite rewards are used, its relative advantage estimation may conflict with the binary feedback from the formal verifier; meanwhile, its static sampling strategy may discard entire batches of data if no valid proof is found, resulting in zero contribution to model updates and significant data waste. To address these limitations, we propose Group Dual-dynamic and Equal-right-advantage Policy Optimization (GDEPO), a method incorporating three core mechanisms: 1) dynamic additional sampling, which resamples invalid batches until a valid proof is discovered; 2) equal-right advantage, decoupling the sign of the advantage function (based on correctness) from its magnitude (modulated by auxiliary rewards) to ensure stable and correct policy updates; and 3) dynamic additional iterations, applying extra gradient steps to initially failed but eventually successful samples to accelerate learning on challenging cases. Experiments conducted on three datasets of varying difficulty (MinF2F-test, MathOlympiadBench, PutnamBench) confirm the effectiveness of GDEPO, while ablation studies validate the necessity of its synergistic components.

This reveals that these models degenerate into \\textit{blind reasoners}, exploiting linguistic priors to generate plausible answers instead of attending to visual evidence. In response, we propose \\textbf{Thinking with Deltas}, a framework driven by a \\textbf{Differential Visual Reasoning Policy (DVRP)}. DVRP introduces intrinsic supervision via visual triplets, comprising original, masked, and perturbed inputs. It optimizes the model to maximize reasoning divergence from masked inputs (enforcing \\textit{visual sensitivity}) while minimizing divergence from perturbed inputs (ensuring \\textit{visual robustness}). By aligning reasoning variations strictly with the \\textit{Delta} of visual information, DVRP inherently bolsters visual understanding capabilities and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both general and medical benchmarks, without requiring external annotations or auxiliary tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b58\u5728\u611f\u77e5-\u63a8\u7406\u8131\u94a9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u800c\u975e\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5dee\u5206\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u76d1\u7763\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u611f\u77e5-\u63a8\u7406\u8131\u94a9\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u5956\u52b1\u7684RLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u800c\u975e\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u5b8c\u5168\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86'\u76f2\u76ee\u63a8\u7406\u8005'\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u8fd9\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86'\u5dee\u5206\u63a8\u7406'\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u5dee\u5206\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff08DVRP\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u89c6\u89c9\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u63a9\u7801\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u8f93\u5165\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u5305\u62ec\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a9\u7801\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5dee\u5f02\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5728\u5e72\u6270\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5dee\u5f02\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u89c6\u89c9\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u65b9\u6848\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "result": "DVRP\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u901a\u7528\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u611f\u77e5-\u63a8\u7406\u8131\u94a9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u771f\u6b63\u5173\u6ce8\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5dee\u5206\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u76d1\u7763\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u611f\u77e5-\u63a8\u7406\u8131\u8026\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

An Anatomy of the Rashomon Effect", "comment": null, "summary": "The Rashomon effect -- the existence of multiple, distinct models that achieve nearly equivalent predictive performance -- has emerged as a fundamental phenomenon in modern machine learning and statistics. In this paper, we explore the causes underlying the Rashomon effect, organizing them into three categories: statistical sources arising from finite samples and noise in the data-generating process; structural sources arising from non-convexity of optimization objectives and unobserved variables that create fundamental non-identifiability; and procedural sources arising from limitations of optimization algorithms and deliberate restrictions to suboptimal model classes. We synthesize insights from machine learning, statistics, and optimization literature to provide a unified framework for understanding why the multiplicity of good models arises. A key distinction emerges: statistical multiplicity diminishes with more data, structural multiplicity persists asymptotically and cannot be resolved without different data or additional assumptions, and procedural multiplicity reflects choices made by practitioners. Beyond characterizing causes, we discuss both the challenges and opportunities presented by the Rashomon effect, including implications for inference, interpretability, fairness, and decision-making under uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In practice, hospitals experience continual evolution in case mix, annotation protocols, and imaging devices, which leads to catastrophic forgetting when models are updated sequentially. Federated continual learning (FCL) aims to reconcile these challenges but existing methods either ignore the stringent privacy constraints of healthcare or rely on replay buffers and public surrogate datasets that are difficult to justify in clinical settings. We study FCL for chest radiography classification in a setting where hospitals are clients that receive temporally evolving streams of cases and labels. We introduce DP-FedEPC (Differentially Private Federated Elastic Prototype Consolidation), a method that combines elastic weight consolidation (EWC), prototype-based rehearsal, and client-side differential privacy within a standard FedAvg framework.

While reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable success, it often suffers from high sample complexity, reward shaping difficulties, and produces opaque neural network policies that are hard to interpret or verify. Manual design, on the other hand, requires substantial domain expertise and struggles to scale across diverse tasks. In this work, we demonstrate that LLM-driven evolutionary search can effectively synthesize interpretable control policies in the form of executable code. By treating policy synthesis as a code evolution problem, we harness the LLM's prior knowledge of programming patterns and control heuristics while employing evolutionary search to explore the solution space systematically. We implement our approach using EvoToolkit, a framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-driven evolution with customizable fitness evaluation. Our method iteratively evolves populations of candidate policy programs, evaluating them against task-specific objectives and selecting superior individuals for reproduction. This process yields compact, human-readable control policies that can be directly inspected, modified, and formally verified.

Here we show that large language models spontaneously develop synergistic cores -- components where information integration exceeds individual parts -- remarkably similar to those in the human brain. Using principles of information decomposition across multiple LLM model families and architectures, we find that areas in middle layers exhibit synergistic processing while early and late layers rely on redundancy, mirroring the informational organisation in biological brains. This organisation emerges through learning and is absent in randomly initialised networks. Crucially, ablating synergistic components causes disproportionate behavioural changes and performance loss, aligning with theoretical predictions about the fragility of synergy. Moreover, fine-tuning synergistic regions through reinforcement learning yields significantly greater performance gains than training redundant components, yet supervised fine-tuning shows no such advantage. This convergence suggests that synergistic information processing is a fundamental property of intelligence, providing targets for principled model design and testable predictions for biological intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

From this perspective, low-rank parameterizations naturally correspond to low-dimensional Matrix Product States (MPS) representations, which enable entanglement-based characterizations of parameter structure. Thereby, we term and measure \"Artificial Entanglement\", defined as the entanglement entropy of the parameters in artificial neural networks (in particular the LLMs). We first study the representative low-rank adaptation (LoRA) PEFT method, alongside full fine-tuning (FFT), using LLaMA models at the 1B and 8B scales trained on the Tulu3 and OpenThoughts3 datasets, and uncover: (i) Internal artificial entanglement in the updates of query and value projection matrices in LoRA follows a volume law with a central suppression (termed as the \"Entanglement Valley\"), which is sensitive to hyper-parameters and is distinct from that in FFT; (ii) External artificial entanglement in attention matrices, corresponding to token-token correlations in representation space, follows an area law with logarithmic corrections and remains robust to LoRA hyper-parameters and training steps. Drawing a parallel to the No-Hair Theorem in black hole physics, we propose that although LoRA and FFT induce distinct internal entanglement signatures, such differences do not manifest in the attention outputs, suggesting a \"no-hair\" property that results in the effectiveness of low rank updates. We further provide theoretical support based on random matrix theory, and extend our analysis to an MPS Adaptation PEFT method, which exhibits qualitatively similar behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Presented at AIHC (not published)", "summary": "The electroencephalogram (EEG) has been the gold standard for quantifying mental workload; however, due to its complexity and non-portability, it can be constraining. ECG signals, which are feasible on wearable equipment pieces such as headbands, present a promising method for cognitive state monitoring. This research explores whether electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are able to indicate mental workload consistently and act as surrogates for EEG-based cognitive indicators. This study investigates whether ECG-derived features can serve as surrogate indicators of cognitive load, a concept traditionally quantified using EEG. Using a publicly available multimodal dataset (OpenNeuro) of EEG and ECG recorded during working-memory and listening tasks, features of HRV and Catch22 descriptors are extracted from ECG, and spectral band-power with Catch22 features from EEG. A cross-modal regression framework based on XGBoost was trained to map ECG-derived HRV representations to EEG-derived cognitive features. In order to address data sparsity and model brain-heart interactions, we integrated the PSV-SDG to produce EEG-conditioned synthetic HRV time series.This addresses the challenge of inferring cognitive load solely from ECG-derived features using a combination of multimodal learning, signal processing, and synthetic data generation.

Existing WFR solvers, however, are often unstable, computationally expensive, and difficult to scale. Here we introduce WFR Flow Matching (WFR-FM), a simulation-free training algorithm that unifies flow matching with dynamic unbalanced OT. Unlike classical flow matching which regresses only a transport vector field, WFR-FM simultaneously regresses a vector field for displacement and a scalar growth rate function for birth-death dynamics, yielding continuous flows under the WFR geometry. Theoretically, we show that minimizing the WFR-FM loss exactly recovers WFR geodesics. Empirically, WFR-FM yields more accurate and robust trajectory inference in single-cell biology, reconstructing consistent dynamics with proliferation and apoptosis, estimating time-varying growth fields, and applying to generative dynamics under imbalanced data. It outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in efficiency, stability, and reconstruction accuracy.

A central question in this area is how predictions can improve performance, and a key aspect of this analysis is the role of prediction accuracy. In this context, prediction accuracy is defined as a guaranteed probability that an instance drawn from the distribution belongs to the predicted set. As a performance measure that incorporates prediction accuracy, we focus on the distributionally-robust competitive ratio (DRCR), introduced by Sun et al.~(ICML 2024). The DRCR is defined as the expected ratio between the algorithm's cost and the optimal cost, where the expectation is taken over the worst-case instance distribution that satisfies the given prediction and accuracy requirement. A known structural property is that, for any fixed algorithm, the DRCR decreases linearly as prediction accuracy increases. Building on this result, we establish that the optimal DRCR value (i.e., the infimum over all algorithms) is a monotone and concave function of prediction accuracy. We further generalize the DRCR framework to a multiple-prediction setting and show that monotonicity and concavity are preserved in this setting. Finally, we apply our results to the ski rental problem, a benchmark problem in online optimization, to identify the conditions on prediction accuracies required for the optimal DRCR to attain a target value. Moreover, we provide a method for computing the critical accuracy, defined as the minimum accuracy required for the optimal DRCR to strictly improve upon the performance attainable without any accuracy guarantee.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In contrast, affordable hardware is low-cost but constrained by memory capacity and bandwidth, making it unsuitable for direct LLM training. To address this, we propose MoE-DisCo (Mixture-of-Experts with Disentangled Clustering and Coordination), a staged training framework. MoE-DisCo decomposes the MoE model into multiple dense submodels, each consisting of a shared backbone and a single expert, and partitions the training data into subsets using unsupervised clustering. Each submodel is trained independently and in parallel on its assigned data subset using low-cost devices, without any inter-device communication. Subsequently, all experts are integrated into a complete MoE model and fine-tuned globally for a short period on high-memory, high-bandwidth GPUs.

This approach allows large language models (LLMs) to autonomously generate and solve complex problems, thereby improving their reasoning capabilities. However, multi-turn search agents struggle in data-free self-evolution due to the limited question diversity and the substantial compute required for multi-step reasoning and tool using. In this work, we introduce Dr. Zero, a framework enabling search agents to effectively self-evolve without any training data. In particular, we design a self-evolution feedback loop where a proposer generates diverse questions to train a solver initialized from the same base model. As the solver evolves, it incentivizes the proposer to produce increasingly difficult yet solvable tasks, thus establishing an automated curriculum to refine both agents. To enhance training efficiency, we also introduce hop-grouped relative policy optimization (HRPO). This method clusters structurally similar questions to construct group-level baselines, effectively minimizing the sampling overhead in evaluating each query's individual difficulty and solvability. Consequently, HRPO significantly reduces the compute requirements for solver training without compromising performance or stability. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the data-free Dr. Zero matches or surpasses fully supervised search agents, proving that complex reasoning and search capabilities can emerge solely through self-evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This setting induces a fundamental tension among three requirements, i.e., immediacy to adapt to recent behavior, stability to resist transient noise, and generalization to support long-horizon prediction and cold-start users. Most existing approaches satisfy at most two of these requirements, resulting in an inherent impossibility triangle in data-scarce, non-stationary personalization. To address this challenge, we model mobile behavior as a partially observed spatio-temporal tensor and unify short-term adaptation, long-horizon forecasting, and cold-start recommendation as a conditional completion problem, where a user- and task-specific mask specifies which coordinates are treated as evidence. We propose U-MASK, a user-adaptive spatio-temporal masking method that allocates evidence budgets based on user reliability and task sensitivity. To enable mask generation under sparse observations, U-MASK learns a compact, task-agnostic user representation from app and location histories via U-SCOPE, which serves as the sole semantic conditioning signal. A shared diffusion transformer then performs mask-guided generative completion while preserving observed evidence, so personalization and task differentiation are governed entirely by the mask and the user representation. Experiments on real-world mobile datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across short-term prediction, long-horizon forecasting, and cold-start settings, with the largest gains under severe data sparsity.

In this paper, we propose ENTRA, an entropy-based training framework that suppresses redundant reasoning while preserving performance. ENTRA first estimates the token-level importance using a lightweight Bidirectional Importance Estimation (BIE) method, which accounts for both prediction confidence and forward influence.

To address this limitation, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm for MNL contextual bandits leveraging the upper confidence bound principle, specifically designed for non-linear parametric utility functions, including those modeled by neural networks. Under a realizability assumption and a mild geometric condition on the utility function class, our algorithm achieves a regret bound of $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ denotes the total number of rounds.

In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate the effectiveness of existing unlearning schemes when the training dataset includes many samples similar to those targeted for unlearning.

Using an optimized scaffold matching industry best practices (persistent bash + string-replacement editor), we evaluated Focus on N=5 context-intensive instances from SWE-bench Lite using Claude Haiku 4.5. With aggressive prompting that encourages frequent compression, Focus achieves 22.7% token reduction (14.9M -> 11.5M tokens) while maintaining identical accuracy (3/5 = 60% for both agents). Focus performed 6.0 autonomous compressions per task on average, with token savings up to 57% on individual instances.

In recent years, deep learning methods have been demonstrated to outperform mechanistic models at the task of hydrological discharge simulation. Adoption of these methods has been catalysed by the proliferation of large sample hydrology datasets, consisting of the observed discharge and meteorological drivers, along with geological and topographical catchment descriptors. Deep learning methods infer rainfall-runoff characteristics that have been shown to generalise across catchments, benefitting from the data diversity in large datasets. Despite this, application to catchments in Africa has been limited. The lack of adoption of deep learning methodologies is primarily due to sparsity or lack of the spatiotemporal observational data required to enable downstream model training. We therefore investigate the application of deep learning models, including LSTMs, for hydrological discharge simulation in the transboundary Limpopo River basin, emphasising application to data scarce regions. We conduct a number of computational experiments primarily focused on assessing the impact of varying the LSTM model input data on performance. Results confirm that data constraints remain the largest obstacle to deep learning applications across African river basins. We further outline the impact of human influence on data-driven modelling which is a commonly overlooked aspect of data-driven large-sample hydrology approaches and investigate solutions for model adaptation under smaller datasets. Additionally, we include recommendations for future efforts towards seasonal hydrological discharge prediction and direct comparison or inclusion of SWAT model outputs, as well as architectural improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, standard integer quantization (e.g., INT4) fundamentally degrades per- formance by imposing a uniform grid on the heavy-tailed distribution of weight parameters, particularly in smaller-scale models (e.g., <2B parameters). We introduce HAS-VQ (Hessian-Adaptive Sparse Vec- tor Quantization), a compression framework that strictly decouples high-sensitivity outliers from the bulk weight distribution using second-order sensitivity analysis. HAS-VQ employs a Hessian-Masked Decoupling strategy to isolate sensitive parameters, followed by robust Vector Quantization (VQ) of the remaining dense body. Crucially, we introduce a residual sparse feedback mechanism that corrects quan- tization errors in the most sensitive dimensions, ensuring exact reconstruction of outliers. We evaluate HAS-VQ on SmolLM2-1.7B, demonstrating two distinct regimes of superiority: (1) Pareto Dominance over Integer Baselines: At 4.23 effective bits-per-parameter (BPP), we achieve a perplexity of 14.23, significantly outperforming the standard INT4 baseline (20.03 PPL at 4.71 BPP). (2) High-Fidelity Compression: Relative to the FP16 baseline, HAS-VQ achieves a 2.3x reduction in model size (7.03 BPP) while maintaining statistically indistinguishable perplexity (10.12 vs. 10.04), effectively offering a lossless compression alternative for bandwidth-constrained environments.

A critical assumption in existing approaches is that the data requested for unlearning are selected i.i.d.(independent and identically distributed). However,the problem of certified unlearning under non-i.i.d. deletions remains largely unexplored. In practice, unlearning requests are inherently biased, leading to non-i.i.d. deletions and causing distribution shifts between the original and retained datasets. In this paper, we show that certified unlearning with the Newton method becomes inefficient and ineffective under non-i.i.d. unlearning sets. We then propose a better certified unlearning approach by performing a distribution-aware certified unlearning framework based on iterative Newton updates constrained by a trust region. Our method provides a closer approximation to the retrained model and yields a tighter pre-run bound on the gradient residual, thereby ensuring efficient (epsilon, delta)-certified unlearning.

However, this shift introduces input contexts that are inherently noisy, a reality that current sanitized benchmarks fail to capture. We introduce NoisyBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates model robustness across 11 datasets in RAG, reasoning, alignment, and tool-use tasks against diverse noise types, including random documents, irrelevant chat histories, and hard negative distractors. Our evaluation reveals a catastrophic performance drop of up to 80% in state-of-the-art models when faced with contextual distractors. Crucially, we find that agentic workflows often amplify these errors by over-trusting noisy tool outputs, and distractors can trigger emergent misalignment even without adversarial intent. We find that prompting, context engineering, SFT, and outcome-reward only RL fail to ensure robustness; in contrast, our proposed Rationale-Aware Reward (RARE) significantly strengthens resilience by incentivizing the identification of helpful information within noise.

Existing multimodal or prompting-based models generate explanations for humor but operate in an open loop,lacking the ability to critique or refine their reasoning once a prediction is made. We propose FLoReNce, an agentic feedback reasoning framework that treats meme understanding as a closed-loop process during learning and an open-loop process during inference. In the closed loop, a reasoning agent is critiqued by a judge; the error and semantic feedback are converted into control signals and stored in a feedback-informed, non-parametric knowledge base. At inference, the model retrieves similar judged experiences from this KB and uses them to modulate its prompt, enabling better, self-aligned reasoning without finetuning. On the PrideMM dataset, FLoReNce improves both predictive performance and explanation quality over static multimodal baselines, showing that feedback-regulated prompting is a viable path to adaptive meme humor understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The methylation status of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter is a critical molecular biomarker that influences patient response to temozolomide chemotherapy. Traditional methods for determining MGMT status rely on invasive biopsies and are limited by intratumoral heterogeneity and procedural risks. This study presents a radiogenomic molecular imaging analysis framework for the non-invasive prediction of MGMT promoter methylation using multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI).\n  Our approach integrates radiomics, deep learning, and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to analyze MRI-derived imaging phenotypes and correlate them with molecular labels. Radiomic features are extracted from FLAIR, T1-weighted, T1-contrast-enhanced, and T2-weighted MRI sequences, while a 3D convolutional neural network learns deep representations from the same modalities. These complementary features are fused using both early fusion and attention-based strategies and classified to predict MGMT methylation status.\n  To enhance clinical interpretability, we apply XAI methods such as Grad-CAM and SHAP to visualize and explain model decisions. The proposed framework is trained on the RSNA-MICCAI Radiogenomic Classification dataset and externally validated on the BraTS 2021 dataset.

Thus, we propose \"Result -> Justify\", which constrains the output communication to present a conclusion before its structured justification. We introduce SEF (Structured Explainability Framework), operationalizing professional conventions (e.g., CREAC, BLUF) via six metrics for structure and grounding. Experiments across four tasks in three domains validate this approach: all six metrics correlate with correctness (r=0.20-0.42; p<0.001), and SEF achieves 83.9% accuracy (+5.3 over CoT).

This distinction is largely academic for single-shot inference, but becomes critical for agentic AI systems, where a single rephrased prompt can trigger cascading failures in multi-step execution.

Consistent but incorrect outputs reflect bias or missing knowledge; confident guessing reflects calibration failure. Neither constitutes hallucination under this definition. When error is variance-dominated, reducing redundant pathways improves reliability without adding knowledge. We formalize this through Semantic Stability (SS), measured via Paraphrase Consistency (PC@k): generate k paraphrases, greedy decode each, compute mode agreement.

Through a systematic analysis, we identify substantial accuracy variance across these patterns on mathematics and science benchmarks, revealing that a model's default reasoning pattern is often sub-optimal for a given problem. To address this, we introduce Group Pattern Selection Optimization (GPSO), a reinforcement learning framework that extends GRPO by incorporating multi-pattern rollouts, verifier-guided optimal pattern selection per problem, and attention masking during optimization to prevent the leakage of explicit pattern suffixes into the learned policy. By exploring a portfolio of diverse reasoning strategies and optimizing the policy on the most effective ones, GPSO enables the model to internalize the mapping from problem characteristics to optimal reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPSO delivers consistent and substantial performance gains across various model backbones and benchmarks, effectively mitigating pattern sub-optimality and fostering more robust, adaptable reasoning.

Prior work has shown that interventions applied during pretraining, such as rephrasing harmful content, can substantially improve the safety of the resulting models. In this paper, we study the fundamental question: \"When during pretraining should safety interventions be introduced?\" We keep the underlying data fixed and vary only the choice of a safety curriculum: the timing of these interventions, i.e., after 0%, 20%, or 60% of the pretraining token budget. We find that introducing interventions earlier generally yields more robust models with no increase in overrefusal rates, with the clearest benefits appearing after downstream, benign finetuning. We also see clear benefits in the steerability of models towards safer generations. Finally, we observe that earlier interventions reshape internal representations: linear probes more cleanly separate safe vs harmful examples.

As large language models move into real-world deployment, this ideal has been imported wholesale into inference stacks. Recent work from the Thinking Machines Lab has presented a detailed analysis of nondeterminism in LLM inference, showing how batch-invariant kernels and deterministic attention can enforce bitwise-identical outputs, positioning deterministic inference as a prerequisite for reproducibility and enterprise reliability.\n  In this paper, we take the opposite stance. We argue that, for LLMs, deterministic inference kills. It kills the ability to model uncertainty, suppresses emergent abilities, collapses reasoning into a single brittle path, and weakens safety alignment by hiding tail risks. LLMs implement conditional distributions over outputs, not fixed functions. Collapsing these distributions to a single canonical completion may appear reassuring, but it systematically conceals properties central to artificial cognition. We instead advocate Stochastic CHAOS, treating distributional variability as a signal to be measured and controlled.\n  Empirically, we show that deterministic inference is systematically misleading. Single-sample deterministic evaluation underestimates both capability and fragility, masking failure probability under paraphrases and noise. Phase-like transitions associated with emergent abilities disappear under greedy decoding. Multi-path reasoning degrades when forced onto deterministic backbones, reducing accuracy and diagnostic insight. Finally, deterministic evaluation underestimates safety risk by hiding rare but dangerous behaviors that appear only under multi-sample evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While generative AI approaches have shown promise in designing novel dye scaffolds, prior efforts often produced synthetically intractable candidates due to a lack of reaction constraints. Here, we developed SyntheFluor-RL, a generative AI model that employs known reaction libraries and molecular building blocks to create readily synthesizable fluorescent molecule scaffolds via reinforcement learning. To guide the generation of fluorophores, SyntheFluor-RL employs a scoring function built on multiple graph neural networks (GNNs) that predict key photophysical properties, including photoluminescence quantum yield, absorption, and emission wavelengths. These outputs are dynamically weighted and combined with a computed pi-conjugation score to prioritize candidates with desirable optical characteristics and synthetic feasibility. SyntheFluor-RL generated 11,590 candidate molecules, which were filtered to 19 structures predicted to possess dye-like properties.

The top three were characterized, with the lead compound featuring a benzothiadiazole chromophore and exhibiting strong fluorescence (PLQY = 0.62), a large Stokes shift (97 nm), and a long excited-state lifetime (11.5 ns).

These challenges manifest as pathological gradients in forward KL objectives or diversity collapse in reverse KL regimes.

By introducing a tunable parameter beta, Veto serves as an Adaptive Gradient Veto that stabilizes optimization by suppressing harmful gradients on low-confidence tokens, while simultaneously acting as a Decisiveness Knob to balance reward-driven performance with output diversity.

With the rapid development of AI technology in recent years, how to compare and evaluate human and AI intelligence has become an important theoretical issue.

Carnap's methodology of conceptual clarification: similarity to explicandum, exactness, fruitfulness, and simplicity. We then examine six representative definitions: IQ testing, complex problem-solving ability, reward optimization, environmental adaptation, learning efficiency, and predictive ability, and clarify their theoretical strengths and limitations.\n  The results show that while definitions based on predictive ability have high explanatory power and empirical feasibility, they suffer from an inability to adequately explain the relationship between predictions and behavior/benefits. This paper proposes the Extended Predictive Hypothesis (EPH), which views intelligence as a combination of the ability to accurately predict the future and the ability to benefit from those predictions. Furthermore, by distinguishing predictive ability into spontaneous and reactive predictions and adding the concept of gainability, we present a unified framework for explaining various aspects of intelligence, such as creativity, learning, and future planning. In conclusion, this paper argues that the EPH is the most satisfactory and universal definition for comparing human and AI intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing studies mainly focus on accuracy improvement, while critical system-level factors such as inference latency and energy consumption are often overlooked, resulting in increasingly complex model designs that hinder practical deployment. Prior efforts on model compression and acceleration typically optimize either the software or hardware side in isolation. Software-only optimization cannot fundamentally remove intermediate tensor access and operator scheduling overheads, whereas hardware-only optimization is constrained by model structure and precision. As a result, the real-world benefits of such optimizations are often limited. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a reusable software and hardware co-optimization and closed-loop evaluation framework for ME2E autonomous driving inference. The framework jointly integrates software-level model optimization with hardware-level computation optimization under a unified system-level objective. In addition, a multidimensional evaluation metric is introduced to assess system performance by jointly considering safety, comfort, efficiency, latency, and energy, enabling quantitative comparison of different optimization strategies. Experiments across multiple ME2E autonomous driving stacks show that the proposed framework preserves baseline-level driving performance while significantly reducing inference latency and energy consumption, achieving substantial overall system-level improvements. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework provides practical and actionable guidance for efficient deployment of ME2E autonomous driving systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, standard methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are gradient-blind: they preserve high-variance dimensions regardless of their impact on factual knowledge preservation. We introduce Fisher-Aligned Subspace Compression (FASC), a knowledge-aware compression framework that selects subspaces by directly modeling activation-gradient coupling, minimizing a second-order surrogate of the loss function. FASC leverages the Fisher Information Matrix to identify dimensions critical for factual knowledge, which often reside in low-variance but high-gradient-sensitivity subspaces. We propose the Dependence Violation Score (\\r{ho}) as a general-purpose diagnostic metric that quantifies activation-gradient coupling, revealing where factual knowledge is stored within transformer architectures. Extensive experiments on Mistral-7B and Llama-3-8B demonstrate that FASC preserves 6-8% more accuracy on knowledge-intensive benchmarks (MMLU, LAMA) compared to variance-based methods at 50% rank reduction, effectively enabling a 7B model to match the factual recall of a 13B uncompressed model.

Existing offline MARL methods primarily constrain training within the dataset distribution, resulting in overly conservative policies that struggle to generalize beyond the support of the data. While model-based approaches offer a promising solution by expanding the original dataset with synthetic data generated from a learned world model, the high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and complexity of multi-agent systems make it challenging to accurately estimate the transitions and reward functions in offline MARL. Given the difficulty of directly modeling joint dynamics, we propose a local-to-global (LOGO) world model, a novel framework that leverages local predictions-which are easier to estimate-to infer global state dynamics, thus improving prediction accuracy while implicitly capturing agent-wise dependencies. Using the trained world model, we generate synthetic data to augment the original dataset, expanding the effective state-action space. To ensure reliable policy learning, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware sampling mechanism that adaptively weights synthetic data by prediction uncertainty, reducing approximation error propagation to policies. In contrast to conventional ensemble-based methods, our approach requires only an additional encoder for uncertainty estimation, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Extensive experiments across 8 scenarios against 8 baselines demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on standard offline MARL benchmarks, establishing a new model-based baseline for generalizable offline multi-agent learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While prompt-based methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can enhance LLM reasoning abilities to some extent, they often suffer from a lack of faithfulness, where the derived conclusions may not align with the generated reasoning chain. To address this issue, researchers have explored neuro-symbolic approaches to bolster LLM logical reasoning capabilities. However, existing neuro-symbolic methods still face challenges with information loss during the process. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Iterative Feedback-Driven Neuro-Symbolic (IFDNS), a novel prompt-based method that employs a multi-round feedback mechanism to address LLM limitations in handling complex logical relationships. IFDNS utilizes iterative feedback during the logic extraction phase to accurately extract causal relationship statements and translate them into propositional and logical implication expressions, effectively mitigating information loss issues. Furthermore, IFDNS is orthogonal to existing prompt methods, allowing for seamless integration with various prompting approaches.

While existing defenses attempt to mitigate this via data selection, they typically rely on heuristic, instance-level assessments that neglect the global geometry of the data distribution and fail to explicitly repel harmful patterns. To address this, we introduce Safety Optimal Transport (SOT), a novel framework that reframes safe fine-tuning from an instance-level filtering challenge to a distribution-level alignment task grounded in Optimal Transport (OT). At its core is a dual-reference ``push-pull'' weight-learning mechanism: SOT optimizes sample importance by actively pulling the downstream distribution towards a trusted safe anchor while simultaneously pushing it away from a general harmful reference. This establishes a robust geometric safety boundary that effectively purifies the training data. Extensive experiments across diverse model families and domains demonstrate that SOT significantly enhances model safety while maintaining competitive downstream performance, achieving a superior safety-utility trade-off compared to baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this, we propose MAESTRO (Meta-learning Adaptive Estimation of Scalarization Trade-offs for Reward Optimization), which introduces a meta-cognitive orchestration layer that treats reward scalarization as a dynamic latent policy, leveraging the model's terminal hidden states as a semantic bottleneck to perceive task-specific priorities. We formulate this as a contextual bandit problem within a bi-level optimization framework, where a lightweight Conductor network co-evolves with the policy by utilizing group-relative advantages as a meta-reward signal.

This paper proposes the Meta-Cognitive Memory Abstraction method (MCMA), which treats memory abstraction as a learnable cognitive skill rather than a fixed design choice. MCMA decouples task execution from memory management by combining a frozen task model with a learned memory copilot. The memory copilot is trained using direct preference optimization, it determines how memories should be structured, abstracted, and reused. Memories are further organized into a hierarchy of abstraction levels, enabling selective reuse based on task similarity. When no memory is transferable, MCMA transfers the ability to abstract and manage memory by transferring the memory copilot.

We explain this ``missing capacity'' by introducing the innovation capacity $C_{\\mathrm{i}}$, the total capacity allocated to readout components orthogonal to the input filtration (Doob innovations, including input-noise mixing). Using a basis-free Hilbert-space formulation of the predictable/innovation decomposition, we prove the conservation law $C_{\\mathrm{ip}}+C_{\\mathrm{i}}=\\mathrm{rank}(\u03a3_{XX})\\le d$, so predictable and innovation capacities exactly partition the rank of the observable readout dimension covariance $\u03a3_{XX}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\rm d\\times d}$. In linear-Gaussian Johnson-Nyquist regimes, $\u03a3_{XX}(T)=S+T N_0$, the split becomes a generalized-eigenvalue shrinkage rule and gives an explicit monotone tradeoff between temperature and predictable capacity. Geometrically, in whitened coordinates the predictable and innovation components correspond to complementary covariance ellipsoids, making $C_{\\mathrm{i}}$ a trace-controlled innovation budget. A large $C_{\\mathrm{i}}$ forces a high-dimensional innovation subspace with a variance floor and under mild mixing and anti-concentration assumptions this yields extensive innovation-block differential entropy and exponentially many distinguishable histories. Finally, we give an information-theoretic lower bound showing that learning the induced innovation-block law in total variation requires a number of samples that scales with the effective innovation dimension, supporting the generative utility of noisy physical reservoirs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u521b\u65b0\u5bb9\u91cf(C_i)\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u5bb9\u91cf(C_ip)\u4e0e\u8bfb\u51fa\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u79e9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bb9\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0e\u521b\u65b0\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u7269\u7406\u50a8\u5c42\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u7269\u7406\u50a8\u5c42\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u5bb9\u91cf(C_ip)\u901a\u5e38\u8fdc\u5c0f\u4e8e\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u8bfb\u51fa\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u79e9\uff0c\u5b58\u5728'\u7f3a\u5931\u5bb9\u91cf'\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u5e95\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b/\u521b\u65b0\u5206\u89e3\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u521b\u65b0\u5bb9\u91cf(C_i)\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u9ad8\u65afJohnson-Nyquist\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u5c06\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u521b\u65b0\u5206\u91cf\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e92\u8865\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u692d\u7403\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bb9\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8bC_ip + C_i = rank(\u03a3_XX) \u2264 d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u5bb9\u91cf\u5b8c\u6574\u5206\u5272\u4e86\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bfb\u51fa\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u79e9\u3002\u5728Johnson-Nyquist\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u8be5\u5206\u5272\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u5e7f\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u6536\u7f29\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5927C_i\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u521b\u65b0\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u53cd\u96c6\u4e2d\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u5757\u5fae\u5206\u71b5\u548c\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5386\u53f2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u521b\u65b0\u5bb9\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u50a8\u5c42\u4e2d\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u5386\u53f2\u6b63\u4ea4\u7684\u8bfb\u51fa\u5206\u91cf\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u8f93\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u6df7\u5408\uff09\u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\u7269\u7406\u50a8\u5c42\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u63cf\u8ff0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u4e0b\u754c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u7269\u7406\u50a8\u5c42\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches rely on continuous optimization methods like Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) for candidate selection. However, these gradient-based methods can become trapped in local optima, particularly in complex or high-dimensional objective landscapes. This paper presents a simulated annealing-based approach for candidate optimization in batch acquisition functions as an alternative to conventional continuous optimization methods. We evaluate our simulated annealing approach against SLSQP across four benchmark multi-objective optimization problems: ZDT1 (30D, 2 objectives), DTLZ2 (7D, 3 objectives), Kursawe (3D, 2 objectives), and Latent-Aware (4D, 2 objectives). Our results demonstrate that simulated annealing consistently achieves superior hypervolume performance compared to SLSQP in most test functions. The improvement is particularly pronounced for DTLZ2 and Latent-Aware problems, where simulated annealing reaches significantly higher hypervolume values and maintains better convergence characteristics. The histogram analysis of objective space coverage further reveals that simulated annealing explores more diverse and optimal regions of the Pareto front. These findings suggest that metaheuristic optimization approaches like simulated annealing can provide more robust and effective candidate optimization for multi-objective Bayesian optimization, offering a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods for batch acquisition function optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing methods typically fall into two paradigms: step-wise planning, which is reactive but often short-sighted; and one-shot planning, which generates a complete plan upfront yet is brittle to execution errors. Crucially, both paradigms suffer from entangled contexts, where the agent must reason over a monolithic history spanning multiple sub-tasks. This entanglement increases cognitive load and lets local errors propagate across otherwise independent decisions, making recovery computationally expensive. To address this, we propose Task-Decoupled Planning (TDP), a training-free framework that replaces entangled reasoning with task decoupling. TDP decomposes tasks into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of sub-goals via a Supervisor. Using a Planner and Executor with scoped contexts, TDP confines reasoning and replanning to the active sub-task. This isolation prevents error propagation and corrects deviations locally without disrupting the workflow. Results on TravelPlanner, ScienceWorld, and HotpotQA show that TDP outperforms strong baselines while reducing token consumption by up to 82%, demonstrating that sub-task decoupling improves both robustness and efficiency for long-horizon agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Task-Decoupled Planning (TDP)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u8026\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u5927\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u9010\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\u53cd\u5e94\u5feb\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fdc\u89c1\uff0c\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u8ba1\u5212\u4f46\u5bf9\u6267\u884c\u9519\u8bef\u8106\u5f31\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u90fd\u9762\u4e34\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ea0\u7f20\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u5c40\u90e8\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTDP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bSupervisor\uff08\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\uff09\u3001Planner\u548cExecutor\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u9650\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u6267\u884c\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u9650\u5b9a\u5728\u6d3b\u8dc3\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u5185\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "\u5728TravelPlanner\u3001ScienceWorld\u548cHotpotQA\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cTDP\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe82%\u7684token\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u8026\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u65f6\u5e8fagent\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u8026\u89c4\u5212\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u9694\u79bb\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ea0\u7f20\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u65f6\u5e8fagent\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Many multi-agent systems simulate human roles at a surface level, missing the underlying criteria that lead experts to assess complementary intellectual aspects of a paper. Moreover, prior methods implicitly assume identified weaknesses are valid, ignoring reviewer bias, misunderstanding, and the critical role of author rebuttals in validating review quality. Finally, most systems output unranked weakness lists, rather than prioritizing the most consequential issues for users. In this work, we propose DIAGPaper, a novel multi-agent framework that addresses these challenges through three tightly integrated modules. The customizer module simulates human-defined review criteria and instantiates multiple reviewer agents with criterion-specific expertise.

However, this process fails to account for differences in local neighborhood clarity among samples within each view, thereby hindering accurate characterization of the intrinsic local structure of the data. In this paper, we propose a Kernel Alignment-based multi-view unsupervised FeatUre selection with Sample-level adaptive graph lEarning method (KAFUSE) to address these issues. Specifically, we first employ kernel alignment with an orthogonal constraint to reduce feature redundancy in both linear and nonlinear relationships. Then, a cross-view consistent similarity graph is learned by applying sample-level fusion to each slice of a tensor formed by stacking similarity graphs from different views, which automatically adjusts the view weights for each sample during fusion. These two steps are integrated into a unified model for feature selection, enabling mutual enhancement between them.

This extension enables evaluation of models that jointly reason over tabular evidence and contextual semantics, an increasingly critical capability for foundation models on structured data. Empirical analysis reveals that while metadata-derived features yield modest improvements in classical prediction metrics, these metadata features consistently highlight gaps in the ability of models to leverage semantics in relational context.

This lack of transparency hinders users' ability to understand, validate and trust model behavior, particularly in high-risk applications. Although explainable AI (XAI) has made significant progress, there remains a need for versatile and effective techniques to address increasingly complex models. This work introduces Multivariate Conditional Expectation (MUCE), a model-agnostic method for local explainability designed to capture prediction changes from feature interactions. MUCE extends Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) by exploring a multivariate grid of values in the neighborhood of a given observation at inference time, providing graphical explanations that illustrate the local evolution of model predictions. In addition, two quantitative indices, stability and uncertainty, summarize local behavior and assess model reliability. Uncertainty is further decomposed into uncertainty+ and uncertainty- to capture asymmetric effects that global measures may overlook. The proposed method is validated using XGBoost models trained on three datasets: two synthetic (2D and 3D) to evaluate behavior near decision boundaries, and one transformed real-world dataset to test adaptability to heterogeneous feature types. Results show that MUCE effectively captures complex local model behavior, while the stability and uncertainty indices provide meaningful insight into prediction confidence. MUCE, together with the ICE modification and the proposed indices, offers a practical contribution to local explainability, enabling both graphical and quantitative insights that enhance the interpretability of predictive models and support more trustworthy and transparent decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This formulation compels models to learn physiological structures implicitly, resulting in data inefficiency and opacity that diverge from medical reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose BEAT-Net, a Biomimetic ECG Analysis with Tokenization framework that reformulates the problem as a language modeling task. Utilizing a QRS tokenization strategy to transform continuous signals into biologically aligned heartbeat sequences, the architecture explicitly decomposes cardiac physiology through specialized encoders that extract local beat morphology while normalizing spatial lead perspectives and modeling temporal rhythm dependencies. Evaluations across three large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that BEAT-Net matches the diagnostic accuracy of dominant convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures while substantially improving robustness. The framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency, recovering fully supervised performance using only 30 to 35 percent of annotated data. Moreover, learned attention mechanisms provide inherent interpretability by spontaneously reproducing clinical heuristics, such as Lead II prioritization for rhythm analysis, without explicit supervision. These findings indicate that integrating biological priors offers a computationally efficient and interpretable alternative to data-intensive large-scale pre-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the practical application of PPO is hindered by unreliable advantage estimation in the sparse-reward RLVR regime. This issue arises because the sparse rewards in RLVR lead to inaccurate intermediate value predictions, which in turn introduce significant bias when aggregated at every token by Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE). To address this, we introduce Segmental Advantage Estimation (SAE), which mitigates the bias that GAE can incur in RLVR. Our key insight is that aggregating $n$-step advantages at every token(as in GAE) is unnecessary and often introduces excessive bias, since individual tokens carry minimal information. Instead, SAE first partitions the generated sequence into coherent sub-segments using low-probability tokens as heuristic boundaries. It then selectively computes variance-reduced advantage estimates only from these information-rich segment transitions, effectively filtering out noise from intermediate tokens. Our experiments demonstrate that SAE achieves superior performance, with marked improvements in final scores, training stability, and sample efficiency. These gains are shown to be consistent across multiple model sizes, and a correlation analysis confirms that our proposed advantage estimator achieves a higher correlation with an approximate ground-truth advantage, justifying its superior performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Segmental Advantage Estimation (SAE)\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3RLVR\u4e2d\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u4ee4\u724c\u5212\u5206\u5b50\u6bb5\u843d\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c", "motivation": "\u5728RLVR\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528GAE\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef7\u503c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u8457\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86PPO\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Segmental Advantage Estimation (SAE)\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u4ee4\u724c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u5e8f\u5217\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u8fde\u8d2f\u5b50\u6bb5\u843d\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u6bb5\u843d\u8f6c\u6362\u5904\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u540e\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ee4\u724c\u566a\u58f0", "result": "SAE\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u5206\u6570\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u7740\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u589e\u76ca\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u771f\u5b9e\u4f18\u52bf\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8", "conclusion": "SAE\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u6bb5\u843d\u8f6c\u6362\u5904\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86RLVR\u4e2d\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3aPPO\u5728LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6"}}

Recent Scientific Foundation Models (SFMs) aim to alleviate this cost by learning universal surrogates from large collections of simulated systems, yet they typically rely on monolithic architectures with limited interpretability and high pretraining expense. In this work we introduce Compositional Neural Operators (CompNO), a compositional neural operator framework for parametric PDEs. Instead of pretraining a single large model on heterogeneous data, CompNO first learns a library of Foundation Blocks, where each block is a parametric Fourier neural operator specialized to a fundamental differential operator (e.g. convection, diffusion, nonlinear convection). These blocks are then assembled, via lightweight Adaptation Blocks, into task-specific solvers that approximate the temporal evolution operator for target PDEs. A dedicated boundary-condition operator further enforces Dirichlet constraints exactly at inference time. We validate CompNO on one-dimensional convection, diffusion, convection--diffusion and Burgers' equations from the PDEBench suite. The proposed framework achieves lower relative L2 error than strong baselines (PFNO, PDEFormer and in-context learning based models) on linear parametric systems, while remaining competitive on nonlinear Burgers' flows. The model maintains exact boundary satisfaction with zero loss at domain boundaries, and exhibits robust generalization across a broad range of Peclet and Reynolds numbers. These results demonstrate that compositional neural operators provide a scalable and physically interpretable pathway towards foundation models for PDEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Since severity levels are predefined metadata in system log messages, having a model merely classify them offers limited standalone practical value, revealing little about its underlying ability to interpret system logs. We argue that severity classification is more informative when treated as a benchmark for probing runtime log comprehension rather than as an end task. Using real-world journalctl data from Linux production servers, we evaluate nine small language models (SLMs) and small reasoning language models (SRLMs) under zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) prompting. The results reveal strong stratification. Qwen3-4B achieves the highest accuracy at 95.64% with RAG, while Gemma3-1B improves from 20.25% under few-shot prompting to 85.28% with RAG. Notably, the tiny Qwen3-0.6B reaches 88.12% accuracy despite weak performance without retrieval. In contrast, several SRLMs, including Qwen3-1.7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, degrade substantially when paired with RAG. Efficiency measurements further separate models: most Gemma and Llama variants complete inference in under 1.2 seconds per log, whereas Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning exceeds 228 seconds per log while achieving <10% accuracy. These findings suggest that (1) architectural design, (2) training objectives, and (3) the ability to integrate retrieved context under strict output constraints jointly determine performance. By emphasizing small, deployable models, this benchmark aligns with real-time requirements of digital twin (DT) systems and shows that severity classification serves as a lens for evaluating model competence and real-time deployability, with implications for root cause analysis (RCA) and broader DT integration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u7ea7\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLM\uff09\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SRLM\uff09\u5bf9\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u65e5\u5fd7\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u771f\u5b9eLinux\u751f\u4ea7\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684journalctl\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u548cRAG\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6574\u5408\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u4e25\u91cd\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u672c\u8eab\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u65e5\u5fd7\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff08probe task\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u89e3\u8bfb\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u65e5\u5fd7\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u3001\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u6a21\u578b\u7b26\u5408\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9eLinux\u751f\u4ea7\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684journalctl\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f309\u4e2a\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLMs\uff09\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SRLMs\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e25\u91cd\u7ea7\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6d4b\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff08\u5355\u6761\u65e5\u5fd7\u8017\u65f6\uff09\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86Qwen3\u3001Gemma\u3001Llama\u3001Phi\u3001DeepSeek\u7b49\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u5448\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u5206\u5c42\uff1aQwen3-4B\u5728RAG\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u738795.64%\uff1bGemma3-1B\u4ece\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u768420.25%\u63d0\u5347\u5230RAG\u768485.28%\uff1b\u5fae\u5c0f\u7684Qwen3-0.6B\u5728RAG\u4e0b\u8fbe\u523088.12%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u68c0\u7d22\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u5f31\u3002\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u90e8\u5206SRLMs\uff08\u5982Qwen3-1.7B\u3001DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B\uff09\u5728RAG\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u6548\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u5de8\u5927\uff1aGemma\u4e0eLlama\u53d8\u4f53\u591a\u6570\u57281.2\u79d2/\u6761\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff0c\u800cPhi-4-Mini-Reasoning\u5374\u9700\u8d85\u8fc7228\u79d2/\u6761\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0d\u8db310%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e25\u91cd\u7ea7\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u65e5\u5fd7\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u900f\u955c\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7531\u4e09\u5927\u56e0\u7d20\u5171\u540c\u51b3\u5b9a\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\uff082\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\uff083\uff09\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u8f93\u51fa\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6574\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u5f3a\u8c03\u5c0f\u578b\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u548c\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u96c6\u6210\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

These two methods have different objectives: SFT minimizes the cross-entropy loss between model outputs and expert responses, while RL maximizes reward signals derived from human preferences or rule-based verifiers. Modern reasoning models have widely adopted the practice of alternating SFT and RL training. However, there is no theoretical account of whether they can be decoupled. We prove that decoupling is impossible in either order: (1) SFT-then-RL coupling: RL increases SFT loss under SFT optimality and (2) RL-then-SFT coupling: SFT lowers the reward achieved by RL.

As these models integrate into high-stakes systems, understanding how they encode capabilities has become fundamental to interpretability research. Traditional approaches identify important modules through gradient attribution or activation analysis, assuming specific capabilities map to specific components. However, this oversimplifies neural computation: modules may contribute to multiple capabilities simultaneously, while single capabilities may distribute across multiple modules. These coarse-grained analyses fail to capture fine-grained, distributed capability encoding. We present SCALPEL (Selective Capability Ablation via Low-rank Parameter Editing for Large language models), a framework representing capabilities as low-rank parameter subspaces rather than discrete modules. Our key insight is that capabilities can be characterized by low-rank modifications distributed across layers and modules, enabling precise capability removal without affecting others. By training LoRA adapters to reduce distinguishing correct from incorrect answers while preserving general language modeling quality, SCALPEL identifies low-rank representations responsible for particular capabilities while remaining disentangled from others. Experiments across diverse capability and linguistic tasks from BLiMP demonstrate that SCALPEL successfully removes target capabilities while preserving general capabilities, providing fine-grained insights into capability distribution across parameter space. Results reveal that capabilities exhibit low-rank structure and can be selectively ablated through targeted parameter-space interventions, offering nuanced understanding of capability encoding in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This work presents a novel Surrogate-Based Optimization framework based on Clustering, SBOC for global optimization of such systems, which can be used with any surrogate modeling technique. At each iteration, it uses a single surrogate model for the entire domain, employs k-means clustering to identify unexplored domain, and exploits a local region around the surrogate optimum to potentially add three new sample points in the domain. SBOC has been tested against sixteen promising benchmarking algorithms using 52 analytical test functions of varying input dimensionalities and shape profiles. It successfully identified a global minimum for most test functions with substantially lower computational effort than other algorithms. It worked especially well on test functions with four or more input variables. It was also among the top six algorithms in approaching a global minimum closely. Overall, SBOC is a robust, reliable, and efficient algorithm for global optimization of box-constrained systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, obtaining fully annotated data for all tasks is impractical due to labeling costs. Existing methods for partially labeled MTL typically rely on predictions from unlabeled tasks, making it difficult to establish reliable task associations and potentially leading to negative transfer and suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a prototype-based knowledge retrieval framework that achieves robust MTL instead of relying on predictions from unlabeled tasks. Our framework consists of two key components: (1) a task prototype embedding task-specific characteristics and quantifying task associations, and (2) a knowledge retrieval transformer that adaptively refines feature representations based on these associations. To achieve this, we introduce an association knowledge generating (AKG) loss to ensure the task prototype consistently captures task-specific characteristics.

However, it is difficult to adapt existing Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) strategies to these formats: rotation-based methods compromise fine-grained block isolation; smoothing techniques struggle with significant 4-bit quantization errors; and mixed-precision approaches often conflict with hardware constraints on unified-precision computation. To address these challenges, we propose ARCQuant, a framework that boosts NVFP4 performance via Augmented Residual Channels. Distinct from methods that compromise block isolation or hardware uniformity, ARCQuant maintains a strictly unified NVFP4 format by augmenting the activation matrix with quantized residual channels. This design integrates the error compensation process directly into the matrix reduction dimension, enabling the use of standard, highly optimized GEMM kernels with minimal overhead. Theoretical analysis confirms that the worst-case error bound of our dual-stage NVFP4 quantization is comparable to that of standard 8-bit formats such as MXFP8. Extensive experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models demonstrate that ARCQuant achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, comparable to full-precision baselines in perplexity and downstream tasks.

This theory predicts that Bayesian phase transitions in reinforcement learning should proceed from simple policies with high regret to complex policies with low regret. We verify this prediction empirically in a gridworld environment exhibiting stagewise policy development: phase transitions over SGD training manifest as \"opposing staircases\" where regret decreases sharply while the LLC increases.

This paper, therefore, proposes a Temporal-Frequency Enhanced Contrastive (TFEC) learning framework. To preserve temporal structure while generating low-distortion representations, a temporal-frequency Co-EnHancement (CoEH) mechanism is introduced. Accordingly, a synergistic dual-path representation and cluster distribution learning framework is designed to jointly optimize cluster structure and representation fidelity.

To address this limitation, we propose d3LLM (Pseudo-Distilled Diffusion Large Language Model), striking a balance between accuracy and parallelism: (i) during training, we introduce pseudo-trajectory distillation to teach the model which tokens can be decoded confidently at early steps, thereby improving parallelism; (ii) during inference, we employ entropy-based multi-block decoding with a KV-cache refresh mechanism to achieve high parallelism while maintaining accuracy. To better evaluate dLLMs, we also introduce AUP (Accuracy Under Parallelism), a new metric that jointly measures accuracy and parallelism.

Drawing inspiration from both the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) and its simplified successor TRM, the Tab-TRM model makes predictions by reasoning over the input features. It maintains two learnable latent tokens - an answer token and a reasoning state - that are iteratively refined by a compact, parameter-efficient recursive network. The recursive processing layer repeatedly updates the reasoning state given the full token sequence and then refines the answer token, in close analogy with iterative insurance pricing schemes. Conceptually, Tab-TRM bridges classical actuarial workflows - iterative generalized linear model fitting and minimum-bias calibration - on the one hand, and modern machine learning, in terms of Gradient Boosting Machines, on the other.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, performance can drop considerably when there is a shift in the distribution of data from training to test time. We study this phenomenon in a setting in which the training data come from multiple domains, and the test data come from a domain not seen at training that is subject to significant covariate shift. We present a new method for contrastive learning that incorporates domain labels to increase the domain invariance of learned representations, leading to improved out-of-distribution generalization. Our method adjusts the temperature parameter in the InfoNCE loss -- which controls the relative weighting of negative pairs -- using the probability that a negative sample comes from the same domain as the anchor. This upweights pairs from more similar domains, encouraging the model to discriminate samples based on domain-invariant attributes. Through experiments on a variant of the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that our method yields better out-of-distribution performance than domain generalization baselines. Furthermore, our method maintains strong in-distribution task performance, substantially outperforming baselines on this measure.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the original KAN formulation relies on B-spline basis functions, which incur substantial computational overhead due to De Boor's algorithm. To address this limitation, recent work has explored alternative basis functions such as radial basis functions (RBFs) that can improve computational efficiency and flexibility. Yet, standard RBF-KANs often sacrifice accuracy relative to the original KAN design. In this work, we propose Free-RBF-KAN, a RBF-based KAN architecture that incorporates adaptive learning grids and trainable smoothness to close this performance gap. Our method employs freely learnable RBF shapes that dynamically align grid representations with activation patterns, enabling expressive and adaptive function approximation. Additionally, we treat smoothness as a kernel parameter optimized jointly with network weights, without increasing computational complexity. We provide a general universality proof for RBF-KANs, which encompasses our Free-RBF-KAN formulation. Through a broad set of experiments, including multiscale function approximation, physics-informed machine learning, and PDE solution operator learning, Free-RBF-KAN achieves accuracy comparable to the original B-spline-based KAN while delivering faster training and inference. These results highlight Free-RBF-KAN as a compelling balance between computational efficiency and adaptive resolution, particularly for high-dimensional structured modeling tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, it remains unclear to what extent this expressed confidence is tied to the reasoning, knowledge, or decision making of the model. To test this, we introduce $\\textbf{RiskEval}$: a framework designed to evaluate whether models adjust their abstention policies in response to varying error penalties. Our evaluation of several frontier models reveals a critical dissociation: models are neither cost-aware when articulating their verbal confidence, nor strategically responsive when deciding whether to engage or abstain under high-penalty conditions. Even when extreme penalties render frequent abstention the mathematically optimal strategy, models almost never abstain, resulting in utility collapse. This indicates that calibrated verbal confidence scores may not be sufficient to create trustworthy and interpretable AI systems, as current models lack the strategic agency to convert uncertainty signals into optimal and risk-sensitive decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

DT-ICU integrates variable-length clinical time series with static patient information in a unified multitask architecture, enabling predictions to be updated as new observations accumulate over the ICU stay. We evaluate DT-ICU on the large, publicly available MIMIC-IV dataset, where it consistently outperforms established baseline models under different evaluation settings. Our test-length analysis shows that meaningful discrimination is achieved shortly after admission, while longer observation windows further improve the ranking of high-risk patients in highly imbalanced cohorts. To examine how the model leverages heterogeneous data sources, we perform systematic modality ablations, revealing that the model learnt a reasonable structured reliance on interventions, physiological response observations, and contextual information. These analyses provide interpretable insights into how multimodal signals are combined and how trade-offs between sensitivity and precision emerge. Together, these results demonstrate that DT-ICU delivers accurate, temporally robust, and interpretable predictions, supporting its potential as a practical digital twin framework for continuous patient monitoring in critical care.

Latham", "Andrew Saxe"], "title": "Optimal Learning Rate Schedule for Balancing Effort and Performance", "comment": null, "summary": "Learning how to learn efficiently is a fundamental challenge for biological agents and a growing concern for artificial ones. To learn effectively, an agent must regulate its learning speed, balancing the benefits of rapid improvement against the costs of effort, instability, or resource use. We introduce a normative framework that formalizes this problem as an optimal control process in which the agent maximizes cumulative performance while incurring a cost of learning. From this objective, we derive a closed-form solution for the optimal learning rate, which has the form of a closed-loop controller that depends only on the agent's current and expected future performance. Under mild assumptions, this solution generalizes across tasks and architectures and reproduces numerically optimized schedules in simulations. In simple learning models, we can mathematically analyze how agent and task parameters shape learning-rate scheduling as an open-loop control solution. Because the optimal policy depends on expectations of future performance, the framework predicts how overconfidence or underconfidence influence engagement and persistence, linking the control of learning speed to theories of self-regulated learning. We further show how a simple episodic memory mechanism can approximate the required performance expectations by recalling similar past learning experiences, providing a biologically plausible route to near-optimal behaviour. Together, these results provide a normative and biologically plausible account of learning speed control, linking self-regulated learning, effort allocation, and episodic memory estimation within a unified and tractable mathematical framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
