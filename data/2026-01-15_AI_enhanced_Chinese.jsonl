We propose a multi-agent synthesis framework that explicitly models patient deception to generate high-fidelity, publicly releasable synthetic psychiatric intake records. Starting from DAIC-WOZ interviews, we construct enriched patient profiles and simulate a four-role workflow: a \\emph{Patient} completes self-rated scales and participates in a semi-structured interview under a topic-dependent honesty state; an \\emph{Assessor} selects instruments based on demographics and chief complaints; an \\emph{Evaluator} conducts the interview grounded in rater-administered scales, tracks suspicion, and completes ratings; and a \\emph{Diagnostician} integrates all evidence into a diagnostic summary. Each case links the patient profile, self-rated and rater-administered responses, interview transcript, diagnostic summary, and honesty state. We validate the framework through four complementary evaluations: diagnostic consistency and severity grading, chain-of-thought ablations, human evaluation of clinical realism and dishonesty modeling, and LLM-based comparative evaluation. The resulting corpus spans multiple disorders and severity levels, enabling controlled study of dishonesty-aware psychiatric assessment and the training and evaluation of adaptive dialogue agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has facilitated the paradigm shift from manual to automated data exploration.

This paper presents TiInsight, an SQL-based automated cross-domain exploratory data analysis system. First, TiInsight offers a user-friendly GUI enabling users to explore data using natural language queries. Second, TiInsight offers a robust cross-domain exploratory data analysis pipeline: hierarchical data context (i.e., HDC) generation, question clarification and decomposition, text-to-SQL (i.e., TiSQL), and data visualization (i.e., TiChart). Third, we have implemented and deployed TiInsight in the production environment of PingCAP and demonstrated its capabilities using representative datasets.

We present a proof-of-concept approach to building an Architecture and Data-Structure Aware Linear Algebra (ADSALA) software library that uses machine learning to optimise the runtime performance of BLAS routines. More specifically, our method uses a machine learning model on-the-fly to automatically select the optimal number of threads for a given GEMM task based on the collected training data. Test results on two different HPC node architectures, one based on a two-socket Intel Cascade Lake and the other on a two-socket AMD Zen 3, revealed a 25 to 40 per cent speedup compared to traditional GEMM implementations in BLAS when using GEMM of memory usage within 100 MB.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0bGEMM\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6570\u5728HPC\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b025-40%\u52a0\u901f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u591a\u6838\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfGEMM\u5b9e\u73b0\u96be\u4ee5\u4e3a\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6570\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u6784\u5efaADSALA\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5e93\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u65f6\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9GEMM\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6570\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2aHPC\u8282\u70b9\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u53cc\u8defIntel Cascade Lake\u548c\u53cc\u8defAMD Zen 3\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5185\u5b58\u5c0f\u4e8e100MB\u7684GEMM\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfBLAS\u5b9e\u73b0\u83b7\u5f9725%-40%\u7684\u52a0\u901f", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316GEMM\u5728\u591a\u6838\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6570\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86ADSALA\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c"}}

Thus developing unit tests targeting various design features requires deep understanding of the design functionality and creativity. When one or more unit tests expose a design failure, the debugging engineer needs to diagnose, localize, and debug the failure to ensure design correctness, which is often a painstaking and intense process. In this work, we introduce LAUDE, a unified unit-test generation and debugging framework for hardware designs that cross-pollinates the semantic understanding of the design source code with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of foundational Large-Language Models (LLMs). LAUDE integrates prompt engineering and design execution information to enhance its unit test generation accuracy and code debuggability. We apply LAUDE with closed- and open-source LLMs to a large corpus of buggy hardware design codes derived from the VerilogEval dataset, where generated unit tests detected bugs in up to 100% and 93% of combinational and sequential designs and debugged up to 93% and 84% of combinational and sequential designs, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To bridge this gap, we introduce MACRO-LLM, LLM-empowered multi-agent collaborative reasoning under spatiotemporal partial observability. The architecture addresses spatiotemporal constraints via three modules: (1) the CoProposer mitigates temporal uncertainty by verifying candidate actions via predictive rollouts; (2) the Negotiator overcomes spatial myopia by resolving conflicts through mean-field statistical aggregation; and (3) the Introspector ensures continuous adaptation by analyzing historical experience to refine strategies via semantic gradient descent.

These tools have lowered the cost of code generation, explanation, and testing, while introducing new forms of automation into routine development tasks. In contrast, most of the software engineering and computer engineering curricula remain closely aligned with pedagogical models that equate manual syntax production with technical competence. This growing misalignment raises concerns regarding assessment validity, learning outcomes, and the development of foundational skills. Adopting a conceptual research approach, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing how generative AI alters core software engineering competencies and introduces a pedagogical design model for LLM-integrated education. Attention is given to computer engineering programs in Turkey, where centralized regulation, large class sizes, and exam-oriented assessment practices amplify these challenges. The framework delineates how problem analysis, design, implementation, and testing increasingly shift from construction toward critique, validation, and human-AI stewardship. In addition, the paper argues that traditional plagiarism-centric integrity mechanisms are becoming insufficient, motivating a transition toward a process transparency model.

Recent MAS routing methods aim to balance performance and overhead by dynamically selecting agent roles and language models. However, these approaches typically rely on a homogeneous collaboration mode, where all agents follow the same interaction pattern, limiting collaboration flexibility across different roles. Motivated by Social Capital Theory, which emphasizes that different roles benefit from distinct forms of collaboration, we propose SC-MAS, a framework for constructing heterogeneous and cost-efficient multi-agent systems. SC-MAS models MAS as directed graphs, where edges explicitly represent pairwise collaboration strategies, allowing different agent pairs to interact through tailored communication patterns. Given an input query, a unified controller progressively constructs an executable MAS by selecting task-relevant agent roles, assigning edge-level collaboration strategies, and allocating appropriate LLM backbones to individual agents. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SC-MAS. In particular, SC-MAS improves accuracy by 3.35% on MMLU while reducing inference cost by 15.38%, and achieves a 3.53% accuracy gain with a 12.13% cost reduction on MBPP. These results validate the feasibility of SC-MAS and highlight the effectiveness of heterogeneous collaboration in multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce ART, an Action-based Reasoning clinical Task benchmark for medical AI agents, which mines real-world EHR data to create challenging tasks targeting known reasoning weaknesses. Through analysis of existing benchmarks, we identify three dominant error categories: retrieval failures, aggregation errors, and conditional logic misjudgments. Our four-stage pipeline -- scenario identification, task generation, quality audit, and evaluation -- produces diverse, clinically validated tasks grounded in real patient data. Evaluating GPT-4o-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on 600 tasks shows near-perfect retrieval after prompt refinement, but substantial gaps in aggregation (28--64%) and threshold reasoning (32--38%).

Instead of representing text or video as sequences of discrete tokens processed by attention, SGFMs treat generation as the evolution of a continuous field governed by constrained stochastic dynamics in a multiscale wavelet basis. This formulation replaces global attention with local operators, spectral projections, and Navier--Stokes-like transport, yielding a generative mechanism grounded in continuity, geometry, and physical structure.\n  Our framework provides three key innovations: (i) a field-theoretic ontology in which text and video are unified as trajectories of a stochastic partial differential equation; (ii) a wavelet-domain representation that induces sparsity, scale separation, and computational efficiency; and (iii) a constrained stochastic flow that enforces stability, coherence, and uncertainty propagation. Together, these components define a generative architecture that departs fundamentally from autoregressive modeling and diffusion-based approaches. SGFMs offer a principled path toward long-range coherence, multimodal generality, and physically structured inductive bias in next-generation generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u8c31\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff08SGFMs\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u53d6\u4ee3\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b83\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5c0f\u6ce2\u57fa\u4e2d\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u573a\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u79bb\u6563\u6807\u8bb0\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u957f\u7a0b\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002SGFMs\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u573a\u8bba\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "SGFMs\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1)\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u573a\u8bba\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\uff1b2)\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u6ce2\u57df\u8868\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff1b3)\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6d41\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u7b97\u5b50\u3001\u8c31\u6295\u5f71\u548c\u7c7b\u4f3cNavier-Stokes\u7684\u8f93\u8fd0\u66ff\u4ee3\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "SGFMs\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u751f\u6210\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u7a0b\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u501a\u7684\u539f\u7406\u6027\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8c31\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u514b\u670d\u5f53\u524dTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We present an empirical study evaluating frontier AI models on 150 workplace tasks within a realistic e-commerce RL environment from Surge. Our analysis reveals an empirically-derived \\emph{hierarchy of agentic capabilities} that models must master for real-world deployment: (1) tool use, (2) planning and goal formation, (3) adaptability, (4) groundedness, and (5) common-sense reasoning. Even the best-performing models fail approximately 40\\% of the tasks, with failures clustering predictably along this hierarchy. Weaker models struggle with fundamental tool use and planning, whereas stronger models primarily fail on tasks requiring contextual inference beyond explicit instructions. We introduce a task-centric design methodology for RL environments that emphasizes diversity and domain expert contributions, provide detailed failure analysis, and discuss implications for agent development.

A comprehensive feature set is engineered, including lagged log-returns (up to 30 days) and established technical indicators such as short- and medium-term rolling volatility measures and the 14-period Relative Strength Index. Hyperparameter optimization is performed using Optuna with time-series cross-validation on the initial training segment. Out-of-sample performance is rigorously assessed via walk-forward validation under both expanding and fixed-length rolling window schemes across multiple lag configurations, simulating real-world deployment and avoiding lookahead bias. Predictive accuracy is evaluated using root mean squared error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination (R-squared), and directional accuracy on both log-returns and reconstructed closing prices. Empirical results show that the optimal configuration, an expanding window with 20 lags, outperforms tuned ARIMA and Ridge regression benchmarks, achieving the lowest log-return RMSE (0.013450) and MAE (0.009814) alongside a directional accuracy of 65.15%.

This process refines the often small but critical details of the model building process, such as which features/patients to include and how clinical categories should be defined. However, this traditional collaboration process is extremely time- and resource-intensive, resulting in only a small fraction of CPMs reaching clinical practice. This challenge intensifies when teams attempt to incorporate unstructured clinical notes, which can contain an enormous number of concepts. To address this challenge, we introduce HACHI, an iterative human-in-the-loop framework that uses AI agents to accelerate the development of fully interpretable CPMs by enabling the exploration of concepts in clinical notes. HACHI alternates between (i) an AI agent rapidly exploring and evaluating candidate concepts in clinical notes and (ii) clinical and domain experts providing feedback to improve the CPM learning process. HACHI defines concepts as simple yes-no questions that are used in linear models, allowing the clinical AI team to transparently review, refine, and validate the CPM learned in each round. In two real-world prediction tasks (acute kidney injury and traumatic brain injury), HACHI outperforms existing approaches, surfaces new clinically relevant concepts not included in commonly-used CPMs, and improves model generalizability across clinical sites and time periods. Furthermore, HACHI reveals the critical role of the clinical AI team, such as directing the AI agent to explore concepts that it had not previously considered, adjusting the granularity of concepts it considers, changing the objective function to better align with the clinical objectives, and identifying issues of data bias and leakage.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Promotions shift, consumer preferences evolve, and supply disruptions alter demand patterns, causing what is known as concept drift. This silent degradation leads to stockouts or excess inventory without triggering any system warnings. Current industry practice relies on manual monitoring and scheduled retraining every 3-6 months, which wastes computational resources during stable periods while missing rapid drift events. Existing academic methods focus narrowly on drift detection without addressing diagnosis or remediation, and they ignore the hierarchical structure inherent in supply chain data. What retailers need is an end-to-end system that detects drift early, explains its root causes, and automatically corrects affected models. We propose DriftGuard, a five-module framework that addresses the complete drift lifecycle. The system combines an ensemble of four complementary detection methods, namely error-based monitoring, statistical tests, autoencoder anomaly detection, and Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) change-point analysis, with hierarchical propagation analysis to identify exactly where drift occurs across product lines. Once detected, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis diagnoses the root causes, and a cost-aware retraining strategy selectively updates only the most affected models. Evaluated on over 30,000 time series from the M5 retail dataset, DriftGuard achieves 97.8% detection recall within 4.2 days and delivers up to 417 return on investment through targeted remediation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising potential solution for automated parallel code generation, but naive prompting often results in syntactically incorrect directives, uncompilable code, or performance that fails to exceed CPU baselines. We present a systematic prompt optimization approach to enhance OpenACC pragma generation without the prohibitive computational costs associated with model post-training. Leveraging the GEPA (GEnetic-PAreto) framework, we iteratively evolve prompts through a reflective feedback loop. This process utilizes crossover and mutation of instructions, guided by expert-curated gold examples and structured feedback based on clause- and clause parameter-level mismatches between the gold and predicted pragma. In our evaluation on the PolyBench suite, we observe an increase in compilation success rates for programs annotated with OpenACC pragma generated using the optimized prompts compared to those annotated using the simpler initial prompt, particularly for the \"nano\"-scale models. Specifically, with optimized prompts, the compilation success rate for GPT-4.1 Nano surged from 66.7% to 93.3%, and for GPT-5 Nano improved from 86.7% to 100%, matching or surpassing the capabilities of their significantly larger, more expensive versions. Beyond compilation, the optimized prompts resulted in a 21% increase in the number of programs that achieve functional GPU speedups over CPU baselines. These results demonstrate that prompt optimization effectively unlocks the potential of smaller, cheaper LLMs in writing stable and effective GPU-offloading directives, establishing a cost-effective pathway to automated directive-based parallelization in HPC workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing large language model (LLM) approaches face fundamental limitations in this domain. Pure reasoning paradigms, which rely on long natural language chains, are prone to inconsistency, error accumulation, and prohibitive cost as constraints compound. Conversely, LLMs combined with coding- or solver-based strategies lack flexibility: they often generate problem-specific code from scratch or depend on fixed solvers, failing to capture generalizable logic across diverse problems. To address these challenges, we introduce the Scalable COde Planning Engine (SCOPE), a framework that disentangles query-specific reasoning from generic code execution. By separating reasoning from execution, SCOPE produces solver functions that are consistent, deterministic, and reusable across queries while requiring only minimal changes to input parameters. SCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance while lowering cost and latency. For example, with GPT-4o, it reaches 93.1% success on TravelPlanner, a 61.6% gain over the best baseline (CoT) while cutting inference cost by 1.4x and time by ~4.67x.

However, their widespread use remains constrained by long sampling trajectories, stochastic variance in the reverse process, and limited structural awareness in denoising dynamics. The Directly Denoising Diffusion Model (DDDM) mitigates these inefficiencies by replacing stochastic reverse MCMC updates with deterministic denoising step, substantially reducing inference time. Yet, the theoretical underpinnings of such deterministic updates have remained opaque. In this work, we provide a principled reinterpretation of DDDM through the lens of the Reverse Transition Kernel (RTK) framework by Huang et al. 2024, unifying deterministic and stochastic diffusion under a shared probabilistic formalism. By expressing the DDDM reverse process as an approximate kernel operator, we show that the direct denoising process implicitly optimizes a structured transport map between noisy and clean samples. This perspective elucidates why deterministic denoising achieves efficient inference. Beyond theoretical clarity, this reframing resolves several long-standing bottlenecks in molecular diffusion. The RTK view ensures numerical stability by enforcing well-conditioned reverse kernels, improves sample consistency by eliminating stochastic variance, and enables scalable and symmetry-preserving denoisers that respect SE(3) equivariance. Empirically, we demonstrate that RTK-guided deterministic denoising achieves faster convergence and higher structural fidelity than stochastic diffusion models, while preserving chemical validity across GEOM-DRUGS dataset.

Decades of work has helped harden C code against attackers, but C projects do not consist of only C code. C projects also contain build system code for automating development tasks like compilation, testing, and packaging. These build systems are critcal to software supply chain security and vulnerable to being poisoned, with the XZ Utils and SolarWinds attacks being recent examples. Existing techniques try to harden software supply chains by verifying software dependencies, but such methods ignore the build system itself. Similarly, classic software security checkers only analyze and monitor program code, not build system code. Moreover, poisoned build systems can easily circumvent tools for detecting program code vulnerabilities by disabling such checks. We present development phase isolation, a novel strategy for hardening build systems against poisoning by modeling the information and behavior permissions of build automation as if it were program code. We have prototyped this approach as a tool called Foreman, which successfully detects and warns about the poisoned test files involved in the XZ Utils attack. We outline our future plans to protect against pipeline poisoning by automatically checking development phase isolation. We envision a future where build system security checkers are as prevalent as program code checkers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Conventional approaches typically rely on event-specific models and explicit analytical formulations, which limits their adaptability and generalization across previously unseen disturbances. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes DScheLLM, a dynamic scheduling approach that leverages fine-tuned large language models within a dual-system (fast-slow) reasoning architecture to address disturbances of different scales. A unified large language model-based framework is constructed to handle dynamic events, where training datasets for both fast and slow reasoning modes are generated using exact schedules obtained from an operations research solver. The Huawei OpenPangu Embedded-7B model is subsequently fine-tuned under the hybrid reasoning paradigms using LoRA. Experimental evaluations on standard job shop scheduling benchmarks demonstrate that the fast-thinking mode can efficiently generate high-quality schedules and the slow-thinking mode can produce solver-compatible and well-formatted decision inputs. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents one of the earliest studies applying large language models to job shop scheduling in dynamic environments, highlighting their considerable potential for intelligent and adaptive scheduling optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DScheLLM\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5feb\u6162\u601d\u7ef4\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7cbe\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u4f5c\u4e1a\u8f66\u95f4\u8c03\u5ea6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u4ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u52a8\u6001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\n2) \u8fd0\u7528\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u786e\u8c03\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e3a\u5feb\u6162\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u521b\u5efa\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\n3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u534e\u4e3a\u76d8\u53e4Embedded-7B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LoRA\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u8c03\n4) \u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5feb\u6162\u601d\u7ef4\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u5feb\u601d\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6162\u601d\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u51b3\u7b56", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u4f5c\u4e1a\u8f66\u95f4\u8c03\u5ea6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff1a\n1) \u5feb\u601d\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\n2) \u6162\u601d\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u517c\u5bb9\u4e14\u683c\u5f0f\u826f\u597d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8f93\u5165\n3) \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86LLM\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6f5c\u529b", "conclusion": "DScheLLM\u662f\u8f83\u65e9\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u4f5c\u4e1a\u8f66\u95f4\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLM\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We propose a novel fairness model that ensures group fairness at a finer granularity level (referred to as block) within each sliding window. This formulation is particularly useful when the window size is large, making it desirable to enforce fairness at a finer granularity. Within this framework, we address two key challenges: efficiently monitoring whether each sliding window satisfies block-level group fairness, and reordering the current window as effectively as possible when fairness is violated. To enable real-time monitoring, we design sketch-based data structures that maintain attribute distributions with minimal overhead. We also develop optimal, efficient algorithms for the reordering task, supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees. Our evaluation on four real-world streaming scenarios demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach. We achieve millisecond-level processing and a throughput of approximately 30,000 queries per second on average, depending on system parameters. The stream reordering algorithm improves block-level group fairness by up to 95% in certain cases, and by 50-60% on average across datasets.

They produce inconsistent results when executed multiple times on the same code, invalidating the assumption that a test failure indicates a software defect. Recent work on LLM-based test generation has identified flakiness as a potential problem with generated tests. However, its prevalence and underlying causes are unclear. We examined the flakiness of LLM-generated tests in the context of four relational database management systems: SAP HANA, DuckDB, MySQL, and SQLite. We amplified test suites with two LLMs, GPT-4o and Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407, to assess the flakiness of the generated test cases. Our results suggest that generated tests have a slightly higher proportion of flaky tests compared to existing tests. Based on a manual inspection, we found that the most common root cause of flakiness was the reliance of a test on a certain order that is not guaranteed (\"unordered collection\"), which was present in 72 of 115 flaky tests (63%). Furthermore, both LLMs transferred the flakiness from the existing tests to the newly generated tests via the provided prompt context. Our experiments suggest that flakiness transfer is more prevalent in closed-source systems such as SAP HANA than in open-source systems. Our study informs developers on what types of flakiness to expect from LLM-generated tests.

Yet conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions in aviation remain siloed and narrow, focusing on isolated tasks or single modalities. They struggle to integrate heterogeneous data such as voice communications, radar tracks, sensor streams and textual reports, which limits situational awareness, adaptability, and real-time decision support. This paper introduces the vision of AviationLMM, a Large Multimodal foundation Model for civil aviation, designed to unify the heterogeneous data streams of civil aviation and enable understanding, reasoning, generation and agentic applications. We firstly identify the gaps between existing AI solutions and requirements. Secondly, we describe the model architecture that ingests multimodal inputs such as air-ground voice, surveillance, on-board telemetry, video and structured texts, and performs cross-modal alignment and fusion, and produces flexible outputs ranging from situation summaries and risk alerts to predictive diagnostics and multimodal incident reconstructions. In order to fully realize this vision, we identify key research opportunities to address, including data acquisition, alignment and fusion, pretraining, reasoning, trustworthiness, privacy, robustness to missing modalities, and synthetic scenario generation.

However, little is known about the energy scaling laws in ML, and existing research focuses on training cost -- ignoring the larger cost of inference. Furthermore, tools for measuring the energy consumption of ML do not provide actionable feedback.\n  To address these gaps, we developed Energy Consumption Optimiser (ECOpt): a hyperparameter tuner that optimises for energy efficiency and model performance. ECOpt quantifies the trade-off between these metrics as an interpretable Pareto frontier. This enables ML practitioners to make informed decisions about energy cost and environmental impact, while maximising the benefit of their models and complying with new regulations.\n  Using ECOpt, we show that parameter and floating-point operation counts can be unreliable proxies for energy consumption, and observe that the energy efficiency of Transformer models for text generation is relatively consistent across hardware. These findings motivate measuring and publishing the energy metrics of ML models. We further show that ECOpt can have a net positive environmental impact and use it to uncover seven models for CIFAR-10 that improve upon the state of the art, when considering accuracy and energy efficiency together.", "AI": {"tldr": "ECOpt\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u5668\uff0c\u5b83\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u8017\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4e24\u8005\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u53ca\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u589e\u5927\u5bfc\u81f4\u80fd\u8017\u589e\u52a0\u3001\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u52a0\u5267\uff0c\u4f46\u5173\u4e8eML\u80fd\u8017\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1Energy Consumption Optimiser\uff08ECOpt\uff09\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u5668\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u80fd\u8017\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u6d6e\u70b9\u8fd0\u7b97\u91cf\u4e0d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u4ee3\u8868\u80fd\u8017\uff0cTransformer\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u6548\u7387\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e00\u81f4\u3002ECOpt\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u51c0\u6b63\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0a\u53d1\u73b07\u4e2a\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "ECOpt\u4f7fML\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u80fd\u5728\u80fd\u8017\u6210\u672c\u3001\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u76ca\u95f4\u505a\u51fa\u660e\u667a\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7b26\u5408\u65b0\u6cd5\u89c4\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u652f\u6301\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u53d1\u5e03ML\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

While adaptive optimizers can accelerate convergence, existing second-order methods such as DP-FedNew require O(d^2) memory at each client to maintain local feature covariance matrices, making them impractical for high-dimensional models. We propose DP-FedSOFIM, a server-side second-order optimization framework that leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) as a natural gradient preconditioner while requiring only O(d) memory per client. By employing the Sherman-Morrison formula for efficient matrix inversion, DP-FedSOFIM achieves O(d) computational complexity per round while maintaining the convergence benefits of second-order methods. Our analysis proves that the server-side preconditioning preserves (epsilon, delta)-differential privacy through the post-processing theorem. Empirical evaluation on CIFAR-10 demonstrates that DP-FedSOFIM achieves superior test accuracy compared to first-order baselines across multiple privacy regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

SafePlanner targets two core challenges: generating structurally meaningful test scenarios and detecting hazardous planning behaviors. To maximize coverage, SafePlanner performs a structural analysis of the Plan model implementation - specifically, its scene-transition logic and hierarchical control flow - and uses this insight to extract feasible scene transitions from code. It then composes test scenarios by combining these transitions with non-player vehicle (NPC) behaviors. Guided fuzzing is applied to explore the behavioral space of the Plan model under these scenarios. We evaluate SafePlanner on Baidu Apollo, a production-grade level 4 ADS. It generates 20635 test cases and detects 520 hazardous behaviors, grouped into 15 root causes through manual analysis. For four of these, we applied patches based on our analysis; the issues disappeared, and no apparent side effects were observed.

This survey presents a comprehensive and structured synthesis of memory in LLMs and MLLMs, organizing the literature into a cohesive taxonomy comprising implicit, explicit, and agentic memory paradigms. Specifically, the survey delineates three primary memory frameworks. Implicit memory refers to the knowledge embedded within the internal parameters of pre-trained transformers, encompassing their capacity for memorization, associative retrieval, and contextual reasoning. Recent work has explored methods to interpret, manipulate, and reconfigure this latent memory. Explicit memory involves external storage and retrieval components designed to augment model outputs with dynamic, queryable knowledge representations, such as textual corpora, dense vectors, and graph-based structures, thereby enabling scalable and updatable interaction with information sources. Agentic memory introduces persistent, temporally extended memory structures within autonomous agents, facilitating long-term planning, self-consistency, and collaborative behavior in multi-agent systems, with relevance to embodied and interactive AI.

Modern space weather monitoring generates massive volumes of high-frequency, multivariate time series (MVTS) data from sources such as the Geostationary perational Environmental Satellites (GOES). Machine learning (ML) models trained on this data show strong predictive power, but most existing methods overlook domain-specific feasibility constraints. Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a key tool for improving model interpretability, yet existing approaches rarely enforce physical plausibility. This work introduces a Physics-Guided Counterfactual Explanation framework, a novel method for generating counterfactual explanations in time series classification tasks that remain consistent with underlying physical principles. Applied to solar energetic particles (SEP) forecasting, this framework achieves over 80% reduction in Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance increasing the proximity, produces counterfactual explanations with higher sparsity, and reduces runtime by nearly 50% compared to state-of-the-art baselines such as DiCE. Beyond numerical improvements, this framework ensures that generated counterfactual explanations are physically plausible and actionable in scientific domains. In summary, the framework generates counterfactual explanations that are both valid and physically consistent, while laying the foundation for scalable counterfactual generation in big data environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u592a\u9633\u9ad8\u80fd\u7c92\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u5177\u6709\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u592a\u9633\u9ad8\u80fd\u7c92\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5ffd\u89c6\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u786e\u4fdd\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u57fa\u672c\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u592a\u9633\u9ad8\u80fd\u7c92\u5b50\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4DiCE\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u6574\u8ddd\u79bb\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8680%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff08\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8fd150%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u65e2\u6709\u6548\u53c8\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5927\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u751f\u6210\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

A prototype featuring a cluster state cache and an intent analyzer (using AWS Bedrock) was developed. Empirical evaluation demonstrated high LLM parsing accuracy (>95% Subset Accuracy on an evaluation ground-truth dataset) for top-tier models like Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large, significantly outperforming a baseline engine. Scheduling quality tests across six scenarios showed the prototype achieved superior or equivalent placement compared to standard Kubernetes configurations, particularly excelling in complex and quantitative scenarios and handling conflicting soft preferences.

By treating agentic spans as first-class citizens within distributed traces, our methodology enables granular analysis of engineering characteristics beyond simple capabilities. Leveraging this benchmark across 21 system variants, we uncover critical engineering realities invisible to traditional metrics: a parameter paradox where lightweight models often surpass flagships in protocol adherence, a pervasive inference dominance that renders protocol overhead secondary, and an expensive failure pattern where self-healing mechanisms paradoxically act as cost multipliers on unviable workflows.

It remains an open question whether the remarkable performance of WSD - using a decaying learning rate for only a fraction of training compared to cosine decay - is a phenomenon specific to transformer-based language models that can potentially offer new theoretical insights into their training dynamics. Inspired by the usage of learning rate schedulers as a new lens into understanding landscape geometry (e.g., river valley, connected minima, progressive sharpening), in this work we compare the WSD path of the Adam optimizer on a Pythia-like language model to that of a small CNN trained to classify CIFAR10 images. We observe most training signals, optimizer path features, and sharpness dynamics to be qualitatively similar in such architectures. This consistency points to shared geometric characteristics of the loss landscapes of old and new nonconvex problems, and hints to future research questions around the geometry of high dimensional optimization problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, when these libraries introduce defects, ranging from silent computation errors to subtle performance regressions, it is often challenging for downstream users to assess whether their own programs are affected. Such impact analysis requires not only understanding the defect semantics but also checking whether the client code satisfies complex triggering conditions involving configuration flags, runtime environments, and indirect API usage. We present DepRadar, an agent coordination framework for fine grained defect and impact analysis in DL library updates. DepRadar coordinates four specialized agents across three steps: 1. the PR Miner and Code Diff Analyzer extract structured defect semantics from commits or pull requests, 2. the Orchestrator Agent synthesizes these signals into a unified defect pattern with trigger conditions, and 3. the Impact Analyzer checks downstream programs to determine whether the defect can be triggered. To improve accuracy and explainability, DepRadar integrates static analysis with DL-specific domain rules for defect reasoning and client side tracing. We evaluate DepRadar on 157 PRs and 70 commits across two representative DL libraries. It achieves 90% precision in defect identification and generates high quality structured fields (average field score 1.6).

However, the dynamic nature of real-world data, broadly termed \\textit{data shift}, renders TDL models prone to rapid performance degradation, requiring costly relabeling and inefficient retraining. Meta-learning, which enables models to adapt quickly to new data with few examples, offers a promising alternative for mitigating these challenges. Here, we systematically compare TDL with fine-tuning and optimization-based meta-learning algorithms to assess their ability to address data shift in time-series classification. We introduce a controlled, task-oriented seismic benchmark (SeisTask) and show that meta-learning typically achieves faster and more stable adaptation with reduced overfitting in data-scarce regimes and smaller model architectures. As data availability and model capacity increase, its advantages diminish, with TDL with fine-tuning performing comparably. Finally, we examine how task diversity influences meta-learning and find that alignment between training and test distributions, rather than diversity alone, drives performance gains. Overall, this work provides a systematic evaluation of when and why meta-learning outperforms TDL under data shift and contributes SeisTask as a benchmark for advancing adaptive learning research in time-series domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, during agent inference, existing methods often suffer from (i) locally myopic generation, due to the absence of lookahead, and (ii) trajectory instability, where minor early errors can escalate into divergent reasoning paths. These issues make it difficult to balance global effectiveness and computational efficiency. To address these two issues, we propose meta-adaptive exploration with LLM agents https://github.com/exoskeletonzj/MAXS, a meta-adaptive reasoning framework based on LLM Agents that flexibly integrates tool execution and reasoning planning. MAXS employs a lookahead strategy to extend reasoning paths a few steps ahead, estimating the advantage value of tool usage, and combines step consistency variance and inter-step trend slopes to jointly select stable, consistent, and high-value reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory convergence mechanism that controls computational cost by halting further rollouts once path consistency is achieved, enabling a balance between resource efficiency and global effectiveness in multi-tool reasoning. We conduct extensive empirical studies across three base models (MiMo-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-32B) and five datasets, demonstrating that MAXS consistently outperforms existing methods in both performance and inference efficiency.

This paper presents an empirical study of 25,173 issues and pull requests from these pipelines to uncover recurring challenges, management practices, and perceived difficulties. Using BERTopic modeling, we identify 13 key challenges, including pipeline development and integration, bug fixing, integrating genomic data, managing CI configurations, and handling version updates. We then examine issue resolution dynamics, showing that 89.38\\% of issues and pull requests are eventually closed, with half resolved within three days.

However, current paradigms typically treat the reasoning process as an indivisible sequence, lacking an intrinsic mechanism to quantify step-wise information gain. This granularity gap manifests in two limitations: inference inefficiency from redundant exploration without explicit guidance, and optimization difficulty due to sparse outcome supervision or costly external verifiers. In this work, we propose CoT-Flow, a framework that reconceptualizes discrete reasoning steps as a continuous probabilistic flow, quantifying the contribution of each step toward the ground-truth answer. Built on this formulation, CoT-Flow enables two complementary methodologies: flow-guided decoding, which employs a greedy flow-based decoding strategy to extract information-efficient reasoning paths, and flow-based reinforcement learning, which constructs a verifier-free dense reward function. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that CoT-Flow achieves a superior balance between inference efficiency and reasoning performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This process is challenging because such bugs are non-deterministic, and bug reports often lack the detailed information needed. Additionally, the unstructured nature of reports written in natural language makes it difficult to extract necessary details. Existing tools are inadequate to reproduce these bugs due to their inability to manage the specific interleaving at the system call level. To address these challenges, we propose SysPro, a novel approach that automatically extracts relevant system call names from bug reports and identifies their locations in the source code. It generates input data by utilizing information retrieval, regular expression matching, and the category-partition method. This extracted input and interleaving data are then used to reproduce bugs through dynamic source code instrumentation.

However, human-driven responses are often fragmented and reactive, with policies formulated in isolation and adjusted only after outbreaks escalate, undermining proactive intervention and global pandemic mitigation. To address this challenge, here we propose a large language model (LLM) multi-agent policymaking framework that supports coordinated and proactive pandemic control across regions. Within our framework, each administrative region is assigned an LLM agent as an AI policymaking assistant. The agent reasons over region-specific epidemiological dynamics while communicating with other agents to account for cross-regional interdependencies. By integrating real-world data, a pandemic evolution simulator, and structured inter-agent communication, our framework enables agents to jointly explore counterfactual intervention scenarios and synthesize coordinated policy decisions through a closed-loop simulation process. We validate the proposed framework using state-level COVID-19 data from the United States between April and December 2020, together with real-world mobility records and observed policy interventions. Compared with real-world pandemic outcomes, our approach reduces cumulative infections and deaths by up to 63.7% and 40.1%, respectively, at the individual state level, and by 39.0% and 27.0%, respectively, when aggregated across states.

However, the standalone use of LLMs without post-processing has proven insufficient, often producing tests that fail to compile or achieve high coverage. Several techniques have been proposed to address these issues, reporting improvements in test compilation and coverage. While important, LLM-based test generation techniques have been evaluated against relatively weak baselines (for todays' standards), i.e., old LLM versions and relatively weak prompts, which may exacerbate the performance contribution of the approaches. In other words, stronger (newer) LLMs may obviate any advantage these techniques bring. We investigate this issue by replicating four state-of-the-art LLM-based test generation tools, HITS, SymPrompt, TestSpark, and CoverUp that include engineering components aimed at guiding the test generation process through compilation and execution feedback, and evaluate their relative effectiveness and efficiency over a plain LLM test generation method. We integrate current LLM versions in all approaches and run an experiment on 393 classes and 3,657 methods. Our results show that the plain LLM approach can outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches in all test effectiveness metrics we used: line coverage (by 17.72%), branch coverage (by 19.80%) and mutation score (by 20.92%), and it does so at a comparable cost (LLM queries).

RISER constructs a library of reusable reasoning vectors and employs a lightweight Router to dynamically compose them for each input. The Router is optimized via reinforcement learning under task-level rewards, activating latent cognitive primitives in an emergent and compositional manner. Across seven diverse benchmarks, RISER yields 3.4-6.5% average zero-shot accuracy improvements over the base model while surpassing CoT-style reasoning with 2-3x higher token efficiency and robust accuracy gains.

This inconsistency undermines trust in high-stakes applications where we want consistent predictions. We propose three approaches to reduce inconsistency among predictions for the members of the Rashomon set. The first approach is \\textbf{outlier correction}. An outlier has a label that none of the good models are capable of predicting correctly. Outliers can cause the Rashomon set to have high variance predictions in a local area, so fixing them can lower variance. Our second approach is local patching. In a local region around a test point, models may disagree with each other because some of them are biased. We can detect and fix such biases using a validation set, which also reduces multiplicity. Our third approach is pairwise reconciliation, where we find pairs of models that disagree on a region around the test point. We modify predictions that disagree, making them less biased. These three approaches can be used together or separately, and they each have distinct advantages. The reconciled predictions can then be distilled into a single interpretable model for real-world deployment.

While existing research prioritizes inference-phase optimizations such as prompt compression and model quantization, the generation phase remains underexplored. To tackle these challenges, we propose a knowledge-infused framework named ShortCoder, which optimizes code generation efficiency while preserving semantic equivalence and readability. In particular, we introduce: (1) ten syntax-level simplification rules for Python, derived from AST-preserving transformations, achieving 18.1% token reduction without functional compromise; (2) a hybrid data synthesis pipeline integrating rule-based rewriting with LLM-guided refinement, producing ShorterCodeBench, a corpus of validated tuples of original code and simplified code with semantic consistency; (3) a fine-tuning strategy that injects conciseness awareness into the base LLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ShortCoder consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on HumanEval, achieving an improvement of 18.1%-37.8% in generation efficiency over previous methods while ensuring the performance of code generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Extending autonomous information-seeking agents to multimodal settings introduces critical challenges: the specialization-generalization trade-off that emerges when training models for multimodal tool-use at scale, and the severe scarcity of training data capturing complex, multi-step multimodal search trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose M$^3$Searcher, a modular multimodal information-seeking agent that explicitly decouples information acquisition from answer derivation.

Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels.

It achieves SOTA performance among open-source models of comparable scale across challenging benchmarks in mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation -- even outperforming several larger models. We begin by critically reexamining a widely adopted distillation paradigm in the community: SFT on teacher-generated responses, also known as sequence-level distillation. Although a series of recent works following this scheme have demonstrated remarkable efficiency and strong empirical performance, they are primarily grounded in the SFT perspective. Consequently, these approaches focus predominantly on designing heuristic rules for SFT data filtering, while largely overlooking the core principle of distillation itself -- enabling the student model to learn the teacher's full output distribution so as to inherit its generalization capability. Specifically, we identify three critical limitations in current practice: i) Inadequate representation of the teacher's sequence-level distribution; ii) Misalignment between the teacher's output distribution and the student's learning capacity; and iii) Exposure bias arising from teacher-forced training versus autoregressive inference. In summary, these shortcomings reflect a systemic absence of explicit teacher-student interaction throughout the distillation process, leaving the essence of distillation underexploited. To address these issues, we propose several methodological innovations that collectively form an enhanced sequence-level distillation training pipeline. Remarkably, DASD-4B-Thinking obtains competitive results using only 448K training samples -- an order of magnitude fewer than those employed by most existing open-source efforts.

To address these limitations, we propose STEP: Step-level Trace Evaluation and Pruning, a novel pruning framework that evaluates reasoning steps using hidden states and dynamically prunes unpromising traces during generation. We train a lightweight step scorer to estimate trace quality, and design a GPU memory-aware pruning strategy that triggers pruning as the GPU memory is saturated by KV cache to reduce end-to-end latency. Experiments across challenging reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that STEP reduces end-to-end inference latency by 45%-70% on average compared to self-consistency while also improving reasoning accuracy.

This limitation hinders their ability to maintain long-term user's intents and dynamically adapt to evolving external environments. In this paper, we propose a novel interaction paradigm for proactive Task-oriented Agents capable of bridging the gap between relatively static user's needs and a dynamic environment. We formalize proactivity through two key capabilities, (i) Intent-Conditioned Monitoring: The agent autonomously formulates trigger conditions based on dialog history; (ii) Event-Triggered Follow-up: The agent actively engages the user upon detecting useful environmental updates. We introduce a high-quality data synthesis pipeline to construct complex, multi-turn dialog data in a dynamic environment. Furthermore, we attempt to address the lack of evaluation criteria of task-oriented interaction in a dynamic environment by proposing a new benchmark, namely ChronosBench.

Notably, certain cardiac conditions that are infrequently encountered are disproportionately underrepresented in these datasets. Although algorithmic generation and oversampling of specific ECG signal types can mitigate class skew, there is a lack of consensus regarding the effectiveness of such techniques in ECG classification. Furthermore, the methodologies and scenarios of ECG acquisition introduce noise, further complicating the processing of ECG data. This paper presents a significantly enhanced ECG classifier that simultaneously addresses both class imbalance and noise-related challenges in ECG analysis, as observed in the CPSC 2018 dataset. Specifically, we propose the application of feature fusion based on the wavelet transform, with a focus on wavelet transform-based interclass fusion, to generate the training feature library and the test set feature library. Subsequently, the original training and test data are amalgamated with their respective feature databases, resulting in more balanced training and test datasets. Employing this approach, our ECG model achieves recognition accuracies of up to 99%, 98%, 97%, 98%, 96%, 92%, and 93% for Normal, AF, I-AVB, LBBB, RBBB, PAC, PVC, STD, and STE, respectively. Furthermore, the average recognition accuracy for these categories ranges between 92\\% and 98\\%.

We mine boundary cases where two strong annotators conflict, using a judge to resolve labels. This approach outperforms single-model distillation by 2.4 percent, with judge-resolved samples improving generalization despite higher training loss (0.421 vs 0.393) - evidence that disagreement mining acts as implicit regularization.

Task2Quiz: A Paradigm for Studying Environment Understanding", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex decision-making and tool-use tasks, yet their ability to generalize across varying environments remains a under-examined concern. Current evaluation paradigms predominantly rely on trajectory-based metrics that measure task success, while failing to assess whether agents possess a grounded, transferable model of the environment. To address this gap, we propose Task-to-Quiz (T2Q), a deterministic and automated evaluation paradigm designed to decouple task execution from world-state understanding.

Yet in many engineering settings, varying geometry induces discrete structural changes, including topological changes, abrupt changes in boundary conditions or boundary types, and changes in the effective computational domain, which break the smooth-variation premise. Here we introduce Discrete Solution Operator Learning (DiSOL), a complementary paradigm that learns discrete solution procedures rather than continuous function-space operators. DiSOL factorizes the solver into learnable stages that mirror classical discretizations: local contribution encoding, multiscale assembly, and implicit solution reconstruction on an embedded grid, thereby preserving procedure-level consistency while adapting to geometry-dependent discrete structures. Across geometry-dependent Poisson, advection-diffusion, linear elasticity, as well as spatiotemporal heat-conduction problems, DiSOL produces stable and accurate predictions under both in-distribution and strongly out-of-distribution geometries, including discontinuous boundaries and topological changes.

Early approaches focus on pure text-based reasoning. More recent studies have incorporated multimodal information into the reasoning steps; however, they often follow a single task-specific reasoning pattern, which limits their generalizability across various multimodal tasks. In fact, there are numerous multimodal tasks requiring diverse reasoning skills, such as zooming in on a specific region or marking an object within an image. To address this, we propose unified generative multimodal reasoning, which unifies diverse multimodal reasoning skills by generating intermediate images during the reasoning process. We instantiate this paradigm with Omni-R1, a two-stage SFT+RL framework featuring perception alignment loss and perception reward, thereby enabling functional image generation. Additionally, we introduce Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the need for multimodal annotations by bootstrapping step-wise visualizations from text-only reasoning data. Empirical results show that Omni-R1 achieves unified generative reasoning across a wide range of multimodal tasks, and Omni-R1-Zero can match or even surpass Omni-R1 on average, suggesting a promising direction for generative multimodal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, building these models is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. We address this by proposing LEAN-LLM-OPT, a LightwEight AgeNtic workflow construction framework for LLM-assisted large-scale OPTimization auto-formulation. LEAN-LLM-OPT takes as input a problem description together with associated datasets and orchestrates a team of LLM agents to produce an optimization formulation. Specifically, upon receiving a query, two upstream LLM agents dynamically construct a workflow that specifies, step-by-step, how optimization models for similar problems can be formulated. A downstream LLM agent then follows this workflow to generate the final output. Leveraging LLMs' text-processing capabilities and common modeling practices, the workflow decomposes the modeling task into a sequence of structured sub-tasks and offloads mechanical data-handling operations to auxiliary tools. This design alleviates the downstream agent's burden related to planning and data handling, allowing it to focus on the most challenging components that cannot be readily standardized. Extensive simulations show that LEAN-LLM-OPT, instantiated with GPT-4.1 and the open source gpt-oss-20B, achieves strong performance on large-scale optimization modeling tasks and is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, in a Singapore Airlines choice-based revenue management use case, LEAN-LLM-OPT demonstrates practical value by achieving leading performance across a range of scenarios.

We consider a setting where arms in a cluster may have different distributions. Unlike existing results in this setting, which assume Gaussian-distributed arms, we study a broader class of vector-parametric distributions that satisfy mild regularity conditions. Existing asymptotically optimal BC algorithms require solving an optimization problem as part of their sampling rule at each step, which is computationally costly. We propose an Efficient Bandit Clustering algorithm (EBC), which, instead of solving the full optimization problem, takes a single step toward the optimal value at each time step, making it computationally efficient while remaining asymptotically optimal. We also propose a heuristic variant of EBC, called EBC-H, which further simplifies the sampling rule, with arm selection based on quantities computed as part of the stopping rule. We highlight the computational efficiency of EBC and EBC-H by comparing their per-sample run time with that of existing algorithms. The asymptotic optimality of EBC is supported through simulations on the synthetic datasets. Through simulations on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we show the performance gain of EBC and EBC-H over existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u5e26\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684Bandit Clustering\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1aEBC\u6bcf\u6b65\u4ec5\u5411\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u5355\u6b65\u903c\u8fd1\u800c\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u6c42\u89e3\uff0cEBC-H\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u505c\u6b62\u89c4\u5219\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5747\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Bandit Clustering\u7b97\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u4e14\u6bcf\u6b65\u9700\u6c42\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u65cf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEBC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u5728\u5411\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5206\u5e03\u65cf\uff08\u6ee1\u8db3\u6b63\u5219\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u89c4\u5219\u4ec5\u5411\u6700\u4f18\u503c\u5355\u6b65\u903c\u8fd1\u800c\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u6c42\u89e3\uff1b\u63d0\u51faEBC-H\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u53d8\u4f53\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u505c\u6b62\u89c4\u5219\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u91cf\u76f4\u63a5\u9009\u62e9\u81c2\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7b80\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aEBC\u548cEBC-H\u6bcf\u6837\u672c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86EBC\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff1b\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5747\u663e\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "EBC\u548cEBC-H\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5206\u5e03\u7c7b\u522b\u7684Bandit Clustering\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Across challenging benchmarks in medicine, math, and education, MATTRL improves accuracy by an average of 3.67\\% over a multi-agent baseline, and by 8.67\\% over comparable single-agent baselines.

We prove the existence and non-uniqueness of operator families satisfying these axioms, establishing that multiple distinct aggregation mechanisms conform to the same foundational principles.\n  Within this framework, we establish operator-agnostic guarantees showing that multi-teacher aggregation reduces both stochastic variance and systematic supervisory bias under heterogeneous teachers, while providing Jensen-type bounds, log-loss guarantees, and safety attenuation properties.

To overcome this blind-spot and move from reactive recovery to proactive resilience, we introduce a minimally supervised agentic AI framework that autonomously monitors, analyses, and responds to disruptions across extended supply networks. The architecture comprises seven specialised agents powered by large language models and deterministic tools that jointly detect disruption signals from unstructured news, map them to multi-tier supplier networks, evaluate exposure based on network structure, and recommend mitigations such as alternative sourcing options. \\rev{We evaluate the framework across 30 synthesised scenarios covering three automotive manufacturers and five disruption classes.

Relative to industry benchmarks of multi-day, analyst-driven assessments, this represents a reduction of more than three orders of magnitude in response time.

Raju"], "title": "Geometric Stability: The Missing Axis of Representations", "comment": null, "summary": "Analysis of learned representations has a blind spot: it focuses on $similarity$, measuring how closely embeddings align with external references, but similarity reveals only what is represented, not whether that structure is robust. We introduce $geometric$ $stability$, a distinct dimension that quantifies how reliably representational geometry holds under perturbation, and present $Shesha$, a framework for measuring it. Across 2,463 configurations in seven domains, we show that stability and similarity are empirically uncorrelated ($\u03c1\\approx 0.01$) and mechanistically distinct: similarity metrics collapse after removing the top principal components, while stability retains sensitivity to fine-grained manifold structure. This distinction yields actionable insights: for safety monitoring, stability acts as a functional geometric canary, detecting structural drift nearly 2$\\times$ more sensitively than CKA while filtering out the non-functional noise that triggers false alarms in rigid distance metrics; for controllability, supervised stability predicts linear steerability ($\u03c1= 0.89$-$0.96$); for model selection, stability dissociates from transferability, revealing a geometric tax that transfer optimization incurs. Beyond machine learning, stability predicts CRISPR perturbation coherence and neural-behavioral coupling.

A popular alternative is reward learning, where reward functions are inferred from human feedback rather than manually specified. Recent work has proposed learning reward functions from human feedback in the form of ratings, rather than traditional binary preferences, enabling richer and potentially less cognitively demanding supervision. Building on this paradigm, we introduce a new rating-based RL method, Ranked Return Regression for RL (R4). At its core, R4 employs a novel ranking mean squared error (rMSE) loss, which treats teacher-provided ratings as ordinal targets. Our approach learns from a dataset of trajectory-rating pairs, where each trajectory is labeled with a discrete rating (e.g., \"bad,\" \"neutral,\" \"good\"). At each training step, we sample a set of trajectories, predict their returns, and rank them using a differentiable sorting operator (soft ranks). We then optimize a mean squared error loss between the resulting soft ranks and the teacher's ratings. Unlike prior rating-based approaches, R4 offers formal guarantees: its solution set is provably minimal and complete under mild assumptions. Empirically, using simulated human feedback, we demonstrate that R4 consistently matches or outperforms existing rating and preference-based RL methods on robotic locomotion benchmarks from OpenAI Gym and the DeepMind Control Suite, while requiring significantly less feedback.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Specifically, cost-effective exogenous data (e.g., local weather) can unilaterally influence dynamics of endogenous variables, such as lake surface temperature. Exploiting these links enables more effective forecasts when exogenous inputs are readily available. Transformer-based models capture long-range dependencies but incur high computation and suffer from permutation invariance. Patch-based variants improve efficiency yet can miss local temporal patterns. To efficiently exploit informative signals across both the temporal dimension and relevant exogenous variables, this study proposes XLinear, a lightweight time series forecasting model built upon MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs). XLinear uses a global token derived from an endogenous variable as a pivotal hub for interacting with exogenous variables, and employs MLPs with sigmoid activation to extract both temporal patterns and variate-wise dependencies.

While learning-based solvers offer a promising alternative to costly numerical simulations, existing methods struggle to capture the heterogeneous dynamics of FSI within a unified framework. This challenge is further exacerbated by inconsistencies in response across domains due to interface coupling and by disparities in learning difficulty across fluid and solid regions, leading to instability during prediction. To address these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Graph Attention Solver (HGATSolver). HGATSolver encodes the system as a heterogeneous graph, embedding physical structure directly into the model via distinct node and edge types for fluid, solid, and interface regions. This enables specialized message-passing mechanisms tailored to each physical domain. To stabilize explicit time stepping, we introduce a novel physics-conditioned gating mechanism that serves as a learnable, adaptive relaxation factor. Furthermore, an Inter-domain Gradient-Balancing Loss dynamically balances the optimization objectives across domains based on predictive uncertainty.

Preprint", "summary": "Learning under unobservable feedback reliability poses a distinct challenge beyond optimization robustness: a system must decide whether to learn from an experience, not only how to learn stably. We study this setting as Epistemic Identifiability under Unobservable Reliability (EIUR), where each experience has a latent credibility, reliable and unreliable feedback can be locally indistinguishable, and data are generated in a closed loop by the learner's own evolving beliefs and actions. In EIUR, standard robust learning can converge stably yet form high-confidence, systematically wrong beliefs.\n  We propose metacognitive regulation as a practical response: a second, introspective control loop that infers experience credibility from endogenous evidence in the learner's internal dynamics. We formalize this as a modular Monitor-Trust-Regulator (MTR) decomposition and instantiate it with self-diagnosis, which maintains a slowly varying experience-trust variable that softly modulates learning updates, without exogenous reliability labels or an explicit corruption model.\n  Empirically, in the EIUR regimes studied here, self-diagnosis is associated with improved epistemic identifiability. In reinforcement learning, it enables calibrated skepticism and recovery under systematically corrupted rewards. In supervised learning, it exposes a critical dissociation: performance recovery does not imply epistemic recovery.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating crystals, their application to MOFs is hindered by MOFs' high atomic complexity. Inspired by the success of block-wise paradigms in deep generative models, we pioneer the use of LLMs in this domain by introducing MOF-LLM, the first LLM framework specifically adapted for block-level MOF structure prediction. To effectively harness LLMs for this modular assembly task, our training paradigm integrates spatial-aware continual pre-training (CPT), structural supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and matching-driven reinforcement learning (RL). By incorporating explicit spatial priors and optimizing structural stability via Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), our approach substantially enhances the spatial reasoning capability of a Qwen-3 8B model for accurate MOF structure prediction.

Applying these methods directly leads to spectral collapse and optimization instability, which severely limit model performance. Meanwhile, alternative approaches that leverage update sparsity encounter significant efficiency bottlenecks on modern hardware due to unstructured computations. To address these challenges, we propose GeoRA (Geometry-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation), which exploits the anisotropic and compressible nature of RL update subspaces. GeoRA initializes adapters by extracting principal directions via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) within a geometrically constrained subspace while freezing the residual components. This method preserves the pre-trained geometric structure and enables efficient GPU computation through dense operators. Experiments on Qwen and Llama demonstrate that GeoRA mitigates optimization bottlenecks caused by geometric misalignment. It consistently outperforms established low-rank baselines on key mathematical benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.

Improvements in solving this problem can greatly benefit the clinical value of optoacoustic imaging. Existing variational inversion methods require an accurate and differentiable model of this light transport. As neural surrogate models allow fast and differentiable simulations of complex physical processes, they are considered promising candidates to be used in solving such inverse problems. However, there are in general no guarantees that the derivatives of these surrogate models accurately match those of the underlying physical operator. As accurate derivatives are central to solving inverse problems, errors in the model derivative can considerably hinder high fidelity reconstructions. To overcome this limitation, we present a surrogate model for light transport in tissue that uses Sobolev training to improve the accuracy of the model derivatives. Additionally, the form of Sobolev training we used is suitable for high-dimensional models in general.

Most existing Transformer-based forecasting models adopt vision-centric architectures that neglect the Earth's spherical geometry and zonal periodicity. In addition, conventional autoregressive training is computationally expensive and limits forecast horizons due to error accumulation. To address these challenges, we propose the Shifted Earth Transformer (Searth Transformer), a physics-informed architecture that incorporates zonal periodicity and meridional boundaries into window-based self-attention for physically consistent global information exchange. We further introduce a Relay Autoregressive (RAR) fine-tuning strategy that enables learning long-range atmospheric evolution under constrained memory and computational budgets. Based on these methods, we develop YanTian, a global medium-range weather forecasting model. YanTian achieves higher accuracy than the high-resolution forecast of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and performs competitively with state-of-the-art AI models at one-degree resolution, while requiring roughly 200 times lower computational cost than standard autoregressive fine-tuning. Furthermore, YanTian attains a longer skillful forecast lead time for Z500 (10.3 days) than HRES (9 days).

This makes it a valuable tool in LLM development, offering a competitive alternative to multi-task training. However, merging can be difficult at scale, as successful merging requires choosing the right merge operator, selecting the right models, and merging them in the right order. This often leads researchers to run expensive merge-and-evaluate searches to select the best merge. In this work, we provide an alternative by introducing \\simmerge{}, \\emph{a predictive merge-selection method} that selects the best merge using inexpensive, task-agnostic similarity signals between models. From a small set of unlabeled probes, we compute functional and structural features and use them to predict the performance of a given 2-way merge. Using these predictions, \\simmerge{} selects the best merge operator, the subset of models to merge, and the merge order, eliminating the expensive merge-and-evaluate loop. We demonstrate that we surpass standard merge-operator performance on 2-way merges of 7B-parameter LLMs, and that \\simmerge{} generalizes to multi-way merges and 111B-parameter LLM merges without retraining.

We study this problem from a mechanistic perspective based on model circuits--structured interaction pathways that govern how predictions are formed. We propose Circuit-guided Unlearning Difficulty (CUD), a {\\em pre-unlearning} metric that assigns each sample a continuous difficulty score using circuit-level signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CUD reliably separates intrinsically easy and hard samples, and remains stable across unlearning methods. We identify key circuit-level patterns that reveal a mechanistic signature of difficulty: easy-to-unlearn samples are associated with shorter, shallower interactions concentrated in earlier-to-intermediate parts of the original model, whereas hard samples rely on longer and deeper pathways closer to late-stage computation.

In particular, DeepONets offer a natural formulation for PDE solving, since the solution of a partial differential equation can be interpreted as an operator mapping an initial condition to its corresponding solution field. In this work, we applied DeepONets in the context of process modeling for adsorption technologies, to assess their feasibility as surrogates for cyclic adsorption process simulation and optimization. The goal is to accelerate convergence of cyclic processes such as Temperature-Vacuum Swing Adsorption (TVSA), which require repeated solution of transient PDEs, which are computationally expensive. Since each step of a cyclic adsorption process starts from the final state of the preceding step, effective surrogate modeling requires generalization across a wide range of initial conditions. The governing equations exhibit steep traveling fronts, providing a demanding benchmark for operator learning. To evaluate functional generalization under these conditions, we construct a mixed training dataset composed of heterogeneous initial conditions and train DeepONets to approximate the corresponding solution operators. The trained models are then tested on initial conditions outside the parameter ranges used during training, as well as on completely unseen functional forms. The results demonstrate accurate predictions both within and beyond the training distribution, highlighting DeepONets as potential efficient surrogates for accelerating cyclic adsorption simulations and optimization workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Furthermore, we propose a contemporaneous causal identification algorithm, fully based on GC, using the proposed score-based $GP_{SIC}$ method, and compare its performance to a state of the art contemporaneous time series causal discovery algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7406\u8bba\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6838\u57fa\u683c\u5170\u6770\u56e0\u679c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53ca\u540c\u65f6\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u8bc6\u522b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u6539\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6838\u57fa\u683c\u5170\u6770\u56e0\u679c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u540c\u65f6\u6027\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u5c06\u4e24\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u6838\u57faGC\u65b9\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u5230\u6838\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u56de\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5e73\u6ed1\u4fe1\u606f\u51c6\u5219\u8fb9\u9645\u4f3c\u7136\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b3\uff09\u5f00\u53d1\u5b8c\u5168\u57fa\u4e8eGC\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u8bc6\u522b\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u8bc6\u522b\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e5f\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u7edf\u4e00\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u683c\u5170\u6770\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Current approaches to training single-head looped architectures on benchmark tasks frequently fail or yield suboptimal performance due to a highly non-convex and irregular loss landscape. In these settings, optimization often stagnates in poor local minima and saddle points of the loss landscape, preventing the model from discovering the global minimum point. The internal mechanisms of these single-head looped transformer models remain poorly understood, and training them from scratch remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework that leverages Tsallis entropy and Hamiltonian dynamics to transform the geometry of the loss landscape. By treating the parameter updates as a physical flow, we successfully trained a single-head looped Transformer with model dimension $d = 8$ to solve induction head task with input sequence length of 1000 tokens. This success reveals the internal mechanism behind the superior reasoning capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We find that zero-shot TFMs already achieve strong performance, while the benefits of fine-tuning are highly model and data-dependent. Meta-learning and PEFT provide moderate gains under specific conditions, whereas full supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often reduces accuracy or calibration quality. This work presents the first comprehensive study of fine-tuning in TFMs across benchmarks including TALENT, OpenML-CC18, and TabZilla. We compare Zero-Shot, Meta-Learning, Supervised (SFT), and parameter-efficient (PEFT) approaches, analyzing how dataset factors such as imbalance, size, and dimensionality affect outcomes. Our findings cover performance, calibration, and fairness, offering practical guidelines on when fine-tuning is most beneficial and its limitations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we introduce Contrastive Geometric Learning for Unified Computational Drug Design (ConGLUDe), a single contrastive geometric model that unifies structure- and ligand-based training. ConGLUDe couples a geometric protein encoder that produces whole-protein representations and implicit embeddings of predicted binding sites with a fast ligand encoder, removing the need for pre-defined pockets. By aligning ligands with both global protein representations and multiple candidate binding sites through contrastive learning, ConGLUDe supports ligand-conditioned pocket prediction in addition to virtual screening and target fishing, while being trained jointly on protein-ligand complexes and large-scale bioactivity data. Across diverse benchmarks, ConGLUDe achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot virtual screening performance in settings where no binding pocket information is provided as input, substantially outperforms existing methods on a challenging target fishing task, and demonstrates competitive ligand-conditioned pocket selection. These results highlight the advantages of unified structure-ligand training and position ConGLUDe as a step toward general-purpose foundation models for drug discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
