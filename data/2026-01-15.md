### [1] [A Machine Learning Approach Towards Runtime Optimisation of Matrix Multiplication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09114)
*Yufan Xia,Marco De La Pierre,Amanda S. Barnard,Giuseppe Maria Junior Barca*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 一种基于机器学习的多线程GEMM性能优化方法，通过实时选择最优线程数在HPC平台上实现25-40%加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代多核共享内存系统架构复杂，传统GEMM实现难以为给定任务确定最小化运行时间的最优线程数，需要更智能的优化方法

Method: 构建ADSALA软件库，利用机器学习模型根据收集的训练数据实时自动选择GEMM任务的最优线程数，系统考虑了硬件架构和数据结构特性

Result: 在两个HPC节点架构（双路Intel Cascade Lake和双路AMD Zen 3）上进行测试，在使用内存小于100MB的GEMM任务时，相比传统BLAS实现获得25%-40%的加速

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能有效优化GEMM在多核系统上的性能，通过在线学习选择最优线程数可显著提升计算效率，证明了ADSALA框架的实用价值

Abstract: The GEneral Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) is one of the essential algorithms in scientific computing. Single-thread GEMM implementations are well-optimised with techniques like blocking and autotuning. However, due to the complexity of modern multi-core shared memory systems, it is challenging to determine the number of threads that minimises the multi-thread GEMM runtime. We present a proof-of-concept approach to building an Architecture and Data-Structure Aware Linear Algebra (ADSALA) software library that uses machine learning to optimise the runtime performance of BLAS routines. More specifically, our method uses a machine learning model on-the-fly to automatically select the optimal number of threads for a given GEMM task based on the collected training data. Test results on two different HPC node architectures, one based on a two-socket Intel Cascade Lake and the other on a two-socket AMD Zen 3, revealed a 25 to 40 per cent speedup compared to traditional GEMM implementations in BLAS when using GEMM of memory usage within 100 MB.

Abstract: LLM inference latency critically determines user experience and operational costs, directly impacting throughput under SLO constraints. Even brief latency spikes degrade service quality despite acceptable average performance. However, distributed inference environments featuring diverse software frameworks and XPU architectures combined with dynamic workloads make latency analysis challenging. Constrained by intrusive designs that necessitate service restarts or even suspension, and by hardware-bound implementations that fail to adapt to heterogeneous inference environments, existing AI profiling methods are often inadequate for real-time production analysis.
  We present LatencyPrism, the first zero-intrusion multi-platform latency sculpting system. It aims to break down the inference latency across pipeline, proactively alert on inference latency anomalies, and guarantee adherence to SLOs, all without requiring code modifications or service restarts. LatencyPrism has been deployed across thousands of XPUs for over six months. It enables low-overhead real-time monitoring at batch level with alerts triggered in milliseconds. This approach distinguishes between workload-driven latency variations and anomalies indicating underlying issues with an F1-score of 0.98. We also conduct extensive experiments and investigations into root cause analysis to demonstrate LatencyPrism's capability.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large-scale, compute-intensive applications such as high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, and big data is leading to convergence between cloud and high-performance computing infrastructures. Cloud providers are increasingly integrating high-performance computing capabilities in their infrastructures, such as hardware accelerators and high-speed interconnects, while researchers in the high-performance computing community are starting to explore cloud-native paradigms to improve scalability, elasticity, and resource utilization. In this context, serverless computing emerges as a promising execution model to efficiently handle highly dynamic, parallel, and distributed workloads. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic literature review of 122 research articles published between 2018 and early 2025, exploring the use of the serverless paradigm to develop, deploy, and orchestrate compute-intensive applications across cloud, high-performance computing, and hybrid environments. From these, a taxonomy comprising eight primary research directions and nine targeted use case domains is proposed, alongside an analysis of recent publication trends and collaboration networks among authors, highlighting the growing interest and interconnections within this emerging research field. Overall, this work aims to offer a valuable foundation for both new researchers and experienced practitioners, guiding the development of next-generation serverless solutions for parallel compute-intensive applications.

### [5] [ConvoLearn: A Dataset of Constructivist Tutor-Student Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08950)
*Mayank Sharma,Roy Pea,Hari Subramonyam*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了ConvoLearn数据集，该数据集基于知识建构理论，包含了认知参与、形成性评估、责任、文化响应性、元认知和权力动态六个核心教学维度。数据集包含了通过教师与模拟学生交互创建的1250个中学地球科学对话。通过QLoRA微调训练，模型（Mistral 7B）展现了显著的教学行为转变，并在教师评估中显著优于基础版本和Claude Sonnet。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教育应用中的LLMs存在固有的教学局限性，例如倾向于揭示答案而非支持对话式学习。这项工作旨在通过建构主义教学法来提升LLMs在教学互动中的能力，即促进知识建构，而非仅仅提供答案。

Method: 构建了一个半合成的数据集ConvoLearn，包含了1250个教师-学生对话（每个20轮次），在中学地球科学领域通过人类教师与模拟学生的受控交互创建。数据基于知识建构理论，涉及六个教学维度。使用QLoRA方法对Mistral 7B模型进行微调，以引导其趋向于采用知识建构策略。

Result: 人类评估（由31名教师进行）表明，微调后的Mistral 7B（M = 4.10, SD = 1.03）在整体表现上显著优于其基座版本（M = 2.59, SD = 1.11）和Claude Sonnet 4.5（M = 2.87, SD = 1.29）。模型行为确实向着知识建构策略方向发生了有意义的转变。

Conclusion: 这项工作为建构主义AI辅导者的未来开发和评估建立了一个潜在的指导框架，展示了通过有目的地设计和利用教学数据集来有针对性地提升LLMs在教学互动中的行为能力是可行的。

Abstract: In educational applications, LLMs exhibit several fundamental pedagogical limitations, such as their tendency to reveal solutions rather than support dialogic learning. We introduce ConvoLearn (https://huggingface.co/datasets/masharma/convolearn ), a dataset grounded in knowledge building theory that operationalizes six core pedagogical dimensions: cognitive engagement, formative assessment, accountability, cultural responsiveness, metacognition, and power dynamics. We construct a semi-synthetic dataset of 1250 tutor-student dialogues (20 turns each) in middle school Earth Science through controlled interactions between human teachers and a simulated student. Using QLoRA, we demonstrate that training on this dataset meaningfully shifts LLM behavior toward knowledge-building strategies. Human evaluation by 31 teachers shows our fine-tuned Mistral 7B (M = 4.10, SD = 1.03) significantly outperforms both its base version (M = 2.59, SD = 1.11) and Claude Sonnet 4.5 (M = 2.87, SD = 1.29) overall. This work establishes a potential framework to guide future development and evaluation of constructivist AI tutors.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reliable clinical decision support requires medical AI agents capable of safe, multi-step reasoning over structured electronic health records (EHRs). While large language models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare, existing benchmarks inadequately assess performance on action-based tasks involving threshold evaluation, temporal aggregation, and conditional logic. We introduce ART, an Action-based Reasoning clinical Task benchmark for medical AI agents, which mines real-world EHR data to create challenging tasks targeting known reasoning weaknesses. Through analysis of existing benchmarks, we identify three dominant error categories: retrieval failures, aggregation errors, and conditional logic misjudgments. Our four-stage pipeline -- scenario identification, task generation, quality audit, and evaluation -- produces diverse, clinically validated tasks grounded in real patient data. Evaluating GPT-4o-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on 600 tasks shows near-perfect retrieval after prompt refinement, but substantial gaps in aggregation (28--64%) and threshold reasoning (32--38%). By exposing failure modes in action-oriented EHR reasoning, ART advances toward more reliable clinical agents, an essential step for AI systems that reduce cognitive load and administrative burden, supporting workforce capacity in high-demand care settings

*Logan Ritchie,Sushant Mehta,Nick Heiner,Mason Yu,Edwin Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 基于大语言模型的智能体评估从单轮响应评估转向交互环境中的多步任务完成。研究通过对150个职场任务的分析，提出了一个由工具使用、规划与目标形成、适应性、基础性和常识推理组成的五层能力层次结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型智能体的发展，AI评估需要从简单的单轮响应评估转向更复杂的多步任务完成评估。研究旨在通过真实电子商务环境中的实证评估，识别当前前沿模型在现实职场任务中存在的关键能力缺陷。

Method: 在Surge的真实电子商务强化学习环境中，对前沿AI模型进行150个职场任务的实证评估分析。采用任务中心化设计方法，强调任务多样性和领域专家贡献，并进行详细的失败分析。

Result: 即使表现最佳的模型仍有约40%的任务失败率，失败模式可预测地沿着能力层次结构分布：较弱模型主要在基础工具使用和规划层面失败，而较强模型主要在需要超越明确指令的上下文推理任务上失败。

Conclusion: 当前前沿模型虽能展示连贯的多步行为，但在实现真实职场环境中人类水平任务完成方面仍存在显著能力差距。需要特别关注工具使用、规划、适应性、基础性和常识推理这五个层次的能力发展。

Abstract: The advancement of large language model (LLM) based agents has shifted AI evaluation from single-turn response assessment to multi-step task completion in interactive environments. We present an empirical study evaluating frontier AI models on 150 workplace tasks within a realistic e-commerce RL environment from Surge. Our analysis reveals an empirically-derived \emph{hierarchy of agentic capabilities} that models must master for real-world deployment: (1) tool use, (2) planning and goal formation, (3) adaptability, (4) groundedness, and (5) common-sense reasoning. Even the best-performing models fail approximately 40\% of the tasks, with failures clustering predictably along this hierarchy. Weaker models struggle with fundamental tool use and planning, whereas stronger models primarily fail on tasks requiring contextual inference beyond explicit instructions. We introduce a task-centric design methodology for RL environments that emphasizes diversity and domain expert contributions, provide detailed failure analysis, and discuss implications for agent development. Our findings suggest that while current frontier models can demonstrate coherent multi-step behavior, substantial capability gaps remain before achieving human-level task completion in realistic workplace settings.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Developing safe, effective, and practically useful clinical prediction models (CPMs) traditionally requires iterative collaboration between clinical experts, data scientists, and informaticists. This process refines the often small but critical details of the model building process, such as which features/patients to include and how clinical categories should be defined. However, this traditional collaboration process is extremely time- and resource-intensive, resulting in only a small fraction of CPMs reaching clinical practice. This challenge intensifies when teams attempt to incorporate unstructured clinical notes, which can contain an enormous number of concepts. To address this challenge, we introduce HACHI, an iterative human-in-the-loop framework that uses AI agents to accelerate the development of fully interpretable CPMs by enabling the exploration of concepts in clinical notes. HACHI alternates between (i) an AI agent rapidly exploring and evaluating candidate concepts in clinical notes and (ii) clinical and domain experts providing feedback to improve the CPM learning process. HACHI defines concepts as simple yes-no questions that are used in linear models, allowing the clinical AI team to transparently review, refine, and validate the CPM learned in each round. In two real-world prediction tasks (acute kidney injury and traumatic brain injury), HACHI outperforms existing approaches, surfaces new clinically relevant concepts not included in commonly-used CPMs, and improves model generalizability across clinical sites and time periods. Furthermore, HACHI reveals the critical role of the clinical AI team, such as directing the AI agent to explore concepts that it had not previously considered, adjusting the granularity of concepts it considers, changing the objective function to better align with the clinical objectives, and identifying issues of data bias and leakage.

Abstract: Multi-constraint planning involves identifying, evaluating, and refining candidate plans while satisfying multiple, potentially conflicting constraints. Existing large language model (LLM) approaches face fundamental limitations in this domain. Pure reasoning paradigms, which rely on long natural language chains, are prone to inconsistency, error accumulation, and prohibitive cost as constraints compound. Conversely, LLMs combined with coding- or solver-based strategies lack flexibility: they often generate problem-specific code from scratch or depend on fixed solvers, failing to capture generalizable logic across diverse problems. To address these challenges, we introduce the Scalable COde Planning Engine (SCOPE), a framework that disentangles query-specific reasoning from generic code execution. By separating reasoning from execution, SCOPE produces solver functions that are consistent, deterministic, and reusable across queries while requiring only minimal changes to input parameters. SCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance while lowering cost and latency. For example, with GPT-4o, it reaches 93.1% success on TravelPlanner, a 61.6% gain over the best baseline (CoT) while cutting inference cost by 1.4x and time by ~4.67x.

TL;DR: 提出了DScheLLM——一种基于双系统（快慢思维）推理架构和精调大语言模型的动态调度方法，用于处理不同规模的扰动。该方法在标准作业车间调度基准测试中展现高效性和高质量结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生产调度方法通常依赖事件特定的模型和显式分析公式，这限制了其适应性以及对未知扰动的泛化能力。为解决这些局限性，本文探索利用大语言模型进行动态调度优化。

Method: 1) 构建基于LLM的统一动态事件处理框架
2) 运用运筹学求解器生成精确调度数据，为快慢推理模式创建训练集
3) 基于华为盘古Embedded-7B模型，使用LoRA在混合推理范式下进行精调
4) 采用双系统（快慢思维）架构：快思维模式高效生成调度方案，慢思维模式生成符合求解器格式的输入决策

Result: 在标准作业车间调度基准测试中：
1) 快思维模式能高效生成高质量调度方案
2) 慢思维模式能生成与求解器兼容且格式良好的决策输入
3) 证明了LLM在动态调度环境中具有显著潜力

Conclusion: DScheLLM是较早将大语言模型应用于动态作业车间调度的研究之一，展示了LLM在智能自适应调度优化方面的巨大潜力，为处理动态扰动提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Production scheduling is highly susceptible to dynamic disruptions, such as variations in processing times, machine availability, and unexpected task insertions. Conventional approaches typically rely on event-specific models and explicit analytical formulations, which limits their adaptability and generalization across previously unseen disturbances. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes DScheLLM, a dynamic scheduling approach that leverages fine-tuned large language models within a dual-system (fast-slow) reasoning architecture to address disturbances of different scales. A unified large language model-based framework is constructed to handle dynamic events, where training datasets for both fast and slow reasoning modes are generated using exact schedules obtained from an operations research solver. The Huawei OpenPangu Embedded-7B model is subsequently fine-tuned under the hybrid reasoning paradigms using LoRA. Experimental evaluations on standard job shop scheduling benchmarks demonstrate that the fast-thinking mode can efficiently generate high-quality schedules and the slow-thinking mode can produce solver-compatible and well-formatted decision inputs. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents one of the earliest studies applying large language models to job shop scheduling in dynamic environments, highlighting their considerable potential for intelligent and adaptive scheduling optimization.

*Wenbin Li,Jingling Wu,Xiaoyong Lin. Jing Chen,Cong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了AviationLMM——一个用于民用航空的大型多模态基础模型，旨在统一民航领域的异构数据流，实现理解、推理、生成和智能体应用，以解决现有AI解决方案的孤立性和局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有民航AI解决方案通常是孤立的、单模态的，难以整合语音通信、雷达轨迹、传感器流和文本报告等异构数据，限制了态势感知、适应性和实时决策支持。需要一个统一的多模态基础模型来克服这些限制。

Conclusion: 通过阐述AviationLMM的设计和挑战，旨在推动民航基础模型的发展，并促进协调研究，朝着构建集成、可信和隐私保护的民航AI生态系统迈进。

Abstract: Civil aviation is a cornerstone of global transportation and commerce, and ensuring its safety, efficiency and customer satisfaction is paramount. Yet conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions in aviation remain siloed and narrow, focusing on isolated tasks or single modalities. They struggle to integrate heterogeneous data such as voice communications, radar tracks, sensor streams and textual reports, which limits situational awareness, adaptability, and real-time decision support. This paper introduces the vision of AviationLMM, a Large Multimodal foundation Model for civil aviation, designed to unify the heterogeneous data streams of civil aviation and enable understanding, reasoning, generation and agentic applications. We firstly identify the gaps between existing AI solutions and requirements. Secondly, we describe the model architecture that ingests multimodal inputs such as air-ground voice, surveillance, on-board telemetry, video and structured texts, and performs cross-modal alignment and fusion, and produces flexible outputs ranging from situation summaries and risk alerts to predictive diagnostics and multimodal incident reconstructions. In order to fully realize this vision, we identify key research opportunities to address, including data acquisition, alignment and fusion, pretraining, reasoning, trustworthiness, privacy, robustness to missing modalities, and synthetic scenario generation. By articulating the design and challenges of AviationLMM, we aim to boost the civil aviation foundation model progress and catalyze coordinated research efforts toward an integrated, trustworthy and privacy-preserving aviation AI ecosystem.

Abstract: Memory plays a foundational role in augmenting the reasoning, adaptability, and contextual fidelity of modern Large Language Models and Multi-Modal LLMs. As these models transition from static predictors to interactive systems capable of continual learning and personalized inference, the incorporation of memory mechanisms has emerged as a central theme in their architectural and functional evolution. This survey presents a comprehensive and structured synthesis of memory in LLMs and MLLMs, organizing the literature into a cohesive taxonomy comprising implicit, explicit, and agentic memory paradigms. Specifically, the survey delineates three primary memory frameworks. Implicit memory refers to the knowledge embedded within the internal parameters of pre-trained transformers, encompassing their capacity for memorization, associative retrieval, and contextual reasoning. Recent work has explored methods to interpret, manipulate, and reconfigure this latent memory. Explicit memory involves external storage and retrieval components designed to augment model outputs with dynamic, queryable knowledge representations, such as textual corpora, dense vectors, and graph-based structures, thereby enabling scalable and updatable interaction with information sources. Agentic memory introduces persistent, temporally extended memory structures within autonomous agents, facilitating long-term planning, self-consistency, and collaborative behavior in multi-agent systems, with relevance to embodied and interactive AI. Extending beyond text, the survey examines the integration of memory within multi-modal settings, where coherence across vision, language, audio, and action modalities is essential. Key architectural advances, benchmark tasks, and open challenges are discussed, including issues related to memory capacity, alignment, factual consistency, and cross-system interoperability.

Abstract: Cluster workload allocation often requires complex configurations, creating a usability gap. This paper introduces a semantic, intent-driven scheduling paradigm for cluster systems using Natural Language Processing. The system employs a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated via a Kubernetes scheduler extender to interpret natural language allocation hint annotations for soft affinity preferences. A prototype featuring a cluster state cache and an intent analyzer (using AWS Bedrock) was developed. Empirical evaluation demonstrated high LLM parsing accuracy (>95% Subset Accuracy on an evaluation ground-truth dataset) for top-tier models like Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large, significantly outperforming a baseline engine. Scheduling quality tests across six scenarios showed the prototype achieved superior or equivalent placement compared to standard Kubernetes configurations, particularly excelling in complex and quantitative scenarios and handling conflicting soft preferences. The results validate using LLMs for accessible scheduling but highlight limitations like synchronous LLM latency, suggesting asynchronous processing for production readiness. This work confirms the viability of semantic soft affinity for simplifying workload orchestration.

Abstract: This paper introduces PRA, an AI-agent design for simulating how individual users form privacy concerns in response to real-world news. Moving beyond population-level sentiment analysis, PRA integrates privacy and cognitive theories to simulate user-specific privacy reasoning grounded in personal comment histories and contextual cues. The agent reconstructs each user's "privacy mind", dynamically activates relevant privacy memory through a contextual filter that emulates bounded rationality, and generates synthetic comments reflecting how that user would likely respond to new privacy scenarios. A complementary LLM-as-a-Judge evaluator, calibrated against an established privacy concern taxonomy, quantifies the faithfulness of generated reasoning. Experiments on real-world Hacker News discussions show that \PRA outperforms baseline agents in privacy concern prediction and captures transferable reasoning patterns across domains including AI, e-commerce, and healthcare.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of AI research has intensified the Reviewer Gap, threatening the peer-review sustainability and perpetuating a cycle of low-quality evaluations. This position paper critiques existing LLM approaches that automatically generate reviews and argues for a paradigm shift that positions LLMs as tools for assisting and educating human reviewers. We define the core principles of high-quality peer review and propose two complementary systems grounded in these foundations: (i) an LLM-assisted mentoring system that cultivates reviewers' long-term competencies, and (ii) an LLM-assisted feedback system that helps reviewers refine the quality of their reviews. This human-centered approach aims to strengthen reviewer expertise and contribute to building a more sustainable scholarly ecosystem.

Motivation: 传统LLM智能体推理存在局部短视和轨迹不稳定问题：缺乏前瞻导致短视生成，早期小错误引发路径发散，难以平衡全局有效性和计算效率

Method: MAXS框架采用元自适应推理策略：1. 前瞻搜索扩展推理步骤，评估工具使用优势值；2. 结合步骤一致性方差和趋势斜率选择稳定高价值步骤；3. 轨迹收敛机制在路径一致时停止展开以控制计算成本

Result: 在三个基础模型和五个数据集上的实验表明，MAXS在性能和推理效率上均优于现有方法，前瞻策略和工具使用有效性得到验证

Conclusion: MAXS通过前瞻搜索和自适应控制平衡了多工具推理的全局有效性与计算效率，为LLM智能体推理提供了稳定高效的元自适应框架

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Agents exhibit inherent reasoning abilities through the collaboration of multiple tools. However, during agent inference, existing methods often suffer from (i) locally myopic generation, due to the absence of lookahead, and (ii) trajectory instability, where minor early errors can escalate into divergent reasoning paths. These issues make it difficult to balance global effectiveness and computational efficiency. To address these two issues, we propose meta-adaptive exploration with LLM agents https://github.com/exoskeletonzj/MAXS, a meta-adaptive reasoning framework based on LLM Agents that flexibly integrates tool execution and reasoning planning. MAXS employs a lookahead strategy to extend reasoning paths a few steps ahead, estimating the advantage value of tool usage, and combines step consistency variance and inter-step trend slopes to jointly select stable, consistent, and high-value reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory convergence mechanism that controls computational cost by halting further rollouts once path consistency is achieved, enabling a balance between resource efficiency and global effectiveness in multi-tool reasoning. We conduct extensive empirical studies across three base models (MiMo-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-32B) and five datasets, demonstrating that MAXS consistently outperforms existing methods in both performance and inference efficiency. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of our lookahead strategy and tool usage.

Abstract: High-quality chain-of-thought has demonstrated strong potential for unlocking the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, current paradigms typically treat the reasoning process as an indivisible sequence, lacking an intrinsic mechanism to quantify step-wise information gain. This granularity gap manifests in two limitations: inference inefficiency from redundant exploration without explicit guidance, and optimization difficulty due to sparse outcome supervision or costly external verifiers. In this work, we propose CoT-Flow, a framework that reconceptualizes discrete reasoning steps as a continuous probabilistic flow, quantifying the contribution of each step toward the ground-truth answer. Built on this formulation, CoT-Flow enables two complementary methodologies: flow-guided decoding, which employs a greedy flow-based decoding strategy to extract information-efficient reasoning paths, and flow-based reinforcement learning, which constructs a verifier-free dense reward function. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that CoT-Flow achieves a superior balance between inference efficiency and reasoning performance.

Abstract: Effective pandemic control requires timely and coordinated policymaking across administrative regions that are intrinsically interdependent. However, human-driven responses are often fragmented and reactive, with policies formulated in isolation and adjusted only after outbreaks escalate, undermining proactive intervention and global pandemic mitigation. To address this challenge, here we propose a large language model (LLM) multi-agent policymaking framework that supports coordinated and proactive pandemic control across regions. Within our framework, each administrative region is assigned an LLM agent as an AI policymaking assistant. The agent reasons over region-specific epidemiological dynamics while communicating with other agents to account for cross-regional interdependencies. By integrating real-world data, a pandemic evolution simulator, and structured inter-agent communication, our framework enables agents to jointly explore counterfactual intervention scenarios and synthesize coordinated policy decisions through a closed-loop simulation process. We validate the proposed framework using state-level COVID-19 data from the United States between April and December 2020, together with real-world mobility records and observed policy interventions. Compared with real-world pandemic outcomes, our approach reduces cumulative infections and deaths by up to 63.7% and 40.1%, respectively, at the individual state level, and by 39.0% and 27.0%, respectively, when aggregated across states. These results demonstrate that LLM multi-agent systems can enable more effective pandemic control with coordinated policymaking...

TL;DR: RISER是一个插件式干预框架，通过动态组合可复用的推理向量来增强LLM推理，使用强化学习优化路由器，在零样本准确率和token效率上均表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于激活干预的方法通常采用静态手动干预，无法适应复杂推理的动态特性，训练密集型方法需要参数更新，缺乏参数效率。

Method: 构建可复用推理向量库，使用轻量级路由器动态组合向量，通过强化学习在任务级奖励下优化路由器，实现潜在认知基元的涌现式组合。

Result: 在7个基准测试中，零样本准确率平均提升3.4-6.5%，超越CoT推理且token效率提高2-3倍，能自主组合向量形成可解释的控制策略。

Conclusion: RISER指向了更可控、高效的LLM推理方向，展示了自适应激活干预在增强领域特定推理方面的潜力。

Abstract: Recent work on domain-specific reasoning with large language models (LLMs) often relies on training-intensive approaches that require parameter updates. While activation steering has emerged as a parameter efficient alternative, existing methods apply static, manual interventions that fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of complex reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose RISER (Router-based Intervention for Steerable Enhancement of Reasoning), a plug-and-play intervention framework that adaptively steers LLM reasoning in activation space. RISER constructs a library of reusable reasoning vectors and employs a lightweight Router to dynamically compose them for each input. The Router is optimized via reinforcement learning under task-level rewards, activating latent cognitive primitives in an emergent and compositional manner. Across seven diverse benchmarks, RISER yields 3.4-6.5% average zero-shot accuracy improvements over the base model while surpassing CoT-style reasoning with 2-3x higher token efficiency and robust accuracy gains. Further analysis shows that RISER autonomously combines multiple vectors into interpretable, precise control strategies, pointing toward more controllable and efficient LLM reasoning.

Conclusion: A³-Bench填补了现有基准在评估记忆驱动推理机制方面的空白，为理解和改进模型的科学推理能力提供了新视角和新工具

Abstract: Scientific reasoning relies not only on logical inference but also on activating prior knowledge and experiential structures. Memory can efficiently reuse knowledge and enhance reasoning consistency and stability. However, existing benchmarks mainly evaluate final answers or step-by-step coherence, overlooking the \textit{memory-driven} mechanisms that underlie human reasoning, which involves activating anchors and attractors, then integrating them into multi-step inference. To address this gap, we propose $A^3$-Bench~ https://a3-bench.github.io, a benchmark designed to evaluate scientific reasoning through dual-scale memory-driven activation, grounded in Anchor and Attractor Activation. First, we annotate 2,198 science reasoning problems across domains using the SAPM process(subject, anchor & attractor, problem, and memory developing). Second, we introduce a dual-scale memory evaluation framework utilizing anchors and attractors, along with the AAUI(Anchor--Attractor Utilization Index) metric to measure memory activation rates. Finally, through experiments with various base models and paradigms, we validate $A^3$-Bench and analyze how memory activation impacts reasoning performance, providing insights into memory-driven scientific reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in DeepResearch-style agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in autonomous information acquisition and synthesize from real-world web environments. However, existing approaches remain fundamentally limited to text modality. Extending autonomous information-seeking agents to multimodal settings introduces critical challenges: the specialization-generalization trade-off that emerges when training models for multimodal tool-use at scale, and the severe scarcity of training data capturing complex, multi-step multimodal search trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose M$^3$Searcher, a modular multimodal information-seeking agent that explicitly decouples information acquisition from answer derivation. M$^3$Searcher is optimized with a retrieval-oriented multi-objective reward that jointly encourages factual accuracy, reasoning soundness, and retrieval fidelity. In addition, we develop MMSearchVQA, a multimodal multi-hop dataset to support retrieval centric RL training. Experimental results demonstrate that M$^3$Searcher outperforms existing approaches, exhibits strong transfer adaptability and effective reasoning in complex multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: STaR有效解決LRM推理鏈隱私風險，提出的MCS和MIA評估指標更全面衡量遺忘效果，推動隱私保護推理技術發展。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have advanced automated multi-step reasoning, but their ability to generate complex Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectories introduces severe privacy risks, as sensitive information may be deeply embedded throughout the reasoning process. Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels. Experiments on the R-TOFU benchmark demonstrate that STaR achieves comprehensive and stable unlearning with minimal utility loss, setting a new standard for privacy-preserving reasoning in LRMs.

Abstract: Lane-free traffic environments allow vehicles to better harness the lateral capacity of the road without being restricted to lane-keeping, thereby increasing the traffic flow rates. As such, we have a distinct and more challenging setting for autonomous driving. In this work, we consider a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning approach for single-agent autonomous driving in lane-free traffic, where the associated Markov Decision Process we formulate is influenced from existing approaches tied to reinforcement learning frameworks. In addition, MCTS is equipped with a pre-trained neural network (NN) that guides the selection phase. This procedure incorporates the predictive capabilities of NNs for a more informed tree search process under computational constraints. In our experimental evaluation, we consider metrics that address both safety (through collision rates) and efficacy (through measured speed). Then, we examine: (a) the influence of isotropic state information for vehicles in a lane-free environment, resulting in nudging behaviour--vehicles' policy reacts due to the presence of faster tailing ones, (b) the acceleration of performance for the NN-guided variant of MCTS, and (c) the trade-off between computational resources and solution quality.

Abstract: Current large language model agents predominantly operate under a reactive paradigm, responding only to immediate user queries within short-term sessions. This limitation hinders their ability to maintain long-term user's intents and dynamically adapt to evolving external environments. In this paper, we propose a novel interaction paradigm for proactive Task-oriented Agents capable of bridging the gap between relatively static user's needs and a dynamic environment. We formalize proactivity through two key capabilities, (i) Intent-Conditioned Monitoring: The agent autonomously formulates trigger conditions based on dialog history; (ii) Event-Triggered Follow-up: The agent actively engages the user upon detecting useful environmental updates. We introduce a high-quality data synthesis pipeline to construct complex, multi-turn dialog data in a dynamic environment. Furthermore, we attempt to address the lack of evaluation criteria of task-oriented interaction in a dynamic environment by proposing a new benchmark, namely ChronosBench. We evaluated some leading close-source and open-source models at present and revealed their flaws in long-term task-oriented interaction. Furthermore, our fine-tuned model trained using synthetic data for supervised learning achieves a task completion rate of 85.19% for complex tasks including shifts in user intent, outperforming other models under test. And the result validated the effectiveness of our data-driven strategy.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex decision-making and tool-use tasks, yet their ability to generalize across varying environments remains a under-examined concern. Current evaluation paradigms predominantly rely on trajectory-based metrics that measure task success, while failing to assess whether agents possess a grounded, transferable model of the environment. To address this gap, we propose Task-to-Quiz (T2Q), a deterministic and automated evaluation paradigm designed to decouple task execution from world-state understanding. We instantiate this paradigm in T2QBench, a suite comprising 30 environments and 1,967 grounded QA pairs across multiple difficulty levels. Our extensive experiments reveal that task success is often a poor proxy for environment understanding, and that current memory machanism can not effectively help agents acquire a grounded model of the environment. These findings identify proactive exploration and fine-grained state representation as primary bottlenecks, offering a robust foundation for developing more generalizable autonomous agents.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are making significant progress in multimodal reasoning. Early approaches focus on pure text-based reasoning. More recent studies have incorporated multimodal information into the reasoning steps; however, they often follow a single task-specific reasoning pattern, which limits their generalizability across various multimodal tasks. In fact, there are numerous multimodal tasks requiring diverse reasoning skills, such as zooming in on a specific region or marking an object within an image. To address this, we propose unified generative multimodal reasoning, which unifies diverse multimodal reasoning skills by generating intermediate images during the reasoning process. We instantiate this paradigm with Omni-R1, a two-stage SFT+RL framework featuring perception alignment loss and perception reward, thereby enabling functional image generation. Additionally, we introduce Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the need for multimodal annotations by bootstrapping step-wise visualizations from text-only reasoning data. Empirical results show that Omni-R1 achieves unified generative reasoning across a wide range of multimodal tasks, and Omni-R1-Zero can match or even surpass Omni-R1 on average, suggesting a promising direction for generative multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Large-scale optimization is a key backbone of modern business decision-making. However, building these models is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. We address this by proposing LEAN-LLM-OPT, a LightwEight AgeNtic workflow construction framework for LLM-assisted large-scale OPTimization auto-formulation. LEAN-LLM-OPT takes as input a problem description together with associated datasets and orchestrates a team of LLM agents to produce an optimization formulation. Specifically, upon receiving a query, two upstream LLM agents dynamically construct a workflow that specifies, step-by-step, how optimization models for similar problems can be formulated. A downstream LLM agent then follows this workflow to generate the final output. Leveraging LLMs' text-processing capabilities and common modeling practices, the workflow decomposes the modeling task into a sequence of structured sub-tasks and offloads mechanical data-handling operations to auxiliary tools. This design alleviates the downstream agent's burden related to planning and data handling, allowing it to focus on the most challenging components that cannot be readily standardized. Extensive simulations show that LEAN-LLM-OPT, instantiated with GPT-4.1 and the open source gpt-oss-20B, achieves strong performance on large-scale optimization modeling tasks and is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, in a Singapore Airlines choice-based revenue management use case, LEAN-LLM-OPT demonstrates practical value by achieving leading performance across a range of scenarios. Along the way, we introduce Large-Scale-OR and Air-NRM, the first comprehensive benchmarks for large-scale optimization auto-formulation. The code and data of this work is available at https://github.com/CoraLiang01/lean-llm-opt.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems have evolved into practical LLM-driven collaborators for many applications, gaining robustness from diversity and cross-checking. However, multi-agent RL (MARL) training is resource-intensive and unstable: co-adapting teammates induce non-stationarity, and rewards are often sparse and high-variance. Therefore, we introduce \textbf{Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL)}, a framework that injects structured textual experience into multi-agent deliberation at inference time. MATTRL forms a multi-expert team of specialists for multi-turn discussions, retrieves and integrates test-time experiences, and reaches consensus for final decision-making. We also study credit assignment for constructing a turn-level experience pool, then reinjecting it into the dialogue. Across challenging benchmarks in medicine, math, and education, MATTRL improves accuracy by an average of 3.67\% over a multi-agent baseline, and by 8.67\% over comparable single-agent baselines. Ablation studies examine different credit-assignment schemes and provide a detailed comparison of how they affect training outcomes. MATTRL offers a stable, effective and efficient path to distribution-shift-robust multi-agent reasoning without tuning.

Abstract: Modern supply chains are increasingly exposed to disruptions from geopolitical events, demand shocks, trade restrictions, to natural disasters. While many of these disruptions originate deep in the supply network, most companies still lack visibility beyond Tier-1 suppliers, leaving upstream vulnerabilities undetected until the impact cascades downstream. To overcome this blind-spot and move from reactive recovery to proactive resilience, we introduce a minimally supervised agentic AI framework that autonomously monitors, analyses, and responds to disruptions across extended supply networks. The architecture comprises seven specialised agents powered by large language models and deterministic tools that jointly detect disruption signals from unstructured news, map them to multi-tier supplier networks, evaluate exposure based on network structure, and recommend mitigations such as alternative sourcing options. \rev{We evaluate the framework across 30 synthesised scenarios covering three automotive manufacturers and five disruption classes. The system achieves high accuracy across core tasks, with F1 scores between 0.962 and 0.991, and performs full end-to-end analyses in a mean of 3.83 minutes at a cost of \$0.0836 per disruption. Relative to industry benchmarks of multi-day, analyst-driven assessments, this represents a reduction of more than three orders of magnitude in response time. A real-world case study of the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict further demonstrates operational applicability. This work establishes a foundational step toward building resilient, proactive, and autonomous supply chains capable of managing disruptions across deep-tier networks.

Abstract: Data scarcity and unreliable self-reporting -- such as concealment or exaggeration -- pose fundamental challenges to psychiatric intake and assessment. We propose a multi-agent synthesis framework that explicitly models patient deception to generate high-fidelity, publicly releasable synthetic psychiatric intake records. Starting from DAIC-WOZ interviews, we construct enriched patient profiles and simulate a four-role workflow: a \emph{Patient} completes self-rated scales and participates in a semi-structured interview under a topic-dependent honesty state; an \emph{Assessor} selects instruments based on demographics and chief complaints; an \emph{Evaluator} conducts the interview grounded in rater-administered scales, tracks suspicion, and completes ratings; and a \emph{Diagnostician} integrates all evidence into a diagnostic summary. Each case links the patient profile, self-rated and rater-administered responses, interview transcript, diagnostic summary, and honesty state. We validate the framework through four complementary evaluations: diagnostic consistency and severity grading, chain-of-thought ablations, human evaluation of clinical realism and dishonesty modeling, and LLM-based comparative evaluation. The resulting corpus spans multiple disorders and severity levels, enabling controlled study of dishonesty-aware psychiatric assessment and the training and evaluation of adaptive dialogue agents.

Abstract: The SQL-based exploratory data analysis has garnered significant attention within the data analysis community. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has facilitated the paradigm shift from manual to automated data exploration. However, existing methods generally lack the ability for cross-domain analysis, and the exploration of LLMs capabilities remains insufficient. This paper presents TiInsight, an SQL-based automated cross-domain exploratory data analysis system. First, TiInsight offers a user-friendly GUI enabling users to explore data using natural language queries. Second, TiInsight offers a robust cross-domain exploratory data analysis pipeline: hierarchical data context (i.e., HDC) generation, question clarification and decomposition, text-to-SQL (i.e., TiSQL), and data visualization (i.e., TiChart). Third, we have implemented and deployed TiInsight in the production environment of PingCAP and demonstrated its capabilities using representative datasets.

Conclusion: MACRO-LLM成功解决了分布式LLM智能体在时空部分可观测环境下的协作瓶颈，为复杂现实场景中多智能体系统的部署提供了有效的框架和解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents deployed in complex real-world scenarios typically operate as spatially distributed entities. However, this physical dispersion constrains agents to limited local perception and finite temporal horizons. We characterize this bottleneck as spatiotemporal partial observability. Given such fragmented awareness, distributed agents struggle to coordinate efficiently. To bridge this gap, we introduce MACRO-LLM, LLM-empowered multi-agent collaborative reasoning under spatiotemporal partial observability. The architecture addresses spatiotemporal constraints via three modules: (1) the CoProposer mitigates temporal uncertainty by verifying candidate actions via predictive rollouts; (2) the Negotiator overcomes spatial myopia by resolving conflicts through mean-field statistical aggregation; and (3) the Introspector ensures continuous adaptation by analyzing historical experience to refine strategies via semantic gradient descent. Extensive evaluations on two complex long-horizon tasks, cooperative adaptive cruise control and pandemic control, demonstrate that our framework effectively mitigates spatiotemporal partial observability through spatial and temporal strategies, enabling robust coordination.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) enhance complex problem solving through multi-agent collaboration, but often incur substantially higher costs than single-agent systems. Recent MAS routing methods aim to balance performance and overhead by dynamically selecting agent roles and language models. However, these approaches typically rely on a homogeneous collaboration mode, where all agents follow the same interaction pattern, limiting collaboration flexibility across different roles. Motivated by Social Capital Theory, which emphasizes that different roles benefit from distinct forms of collaboration, we propose SC-MAS, a framework for constructing heterogeneous and cost-efficient multi-agent systems. SC-MAS models MAS as directed graphs, where edges explicitly represent pairwise collaboration strategies, allowing different agent pairs to interact through tailored communication patterns. Given an input query, a unified controller progressively constructs an executable MAS by selecting task-relevant agent roles, assigning edge-level collaboration strategies, and allocating appropriate LLM backbones to individual agents. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SC-MAS. In particular, SC-MAS improves accuracy by 3.35% on MMLU while reducing inference cost by 15.38%, and achieves a 3.53% accuracy gain with a 12.13% cost reduction on MBPP. These results validate the feasibility of SC-MAS and highlight the effectiveness of heterogeneous collaboration in multi-agent systems.

Motivation: 研究者认为现有的Transformer模型依赖离散标记序列和注意力机制，缺乏物理结构基础和长程连贯性。SGFMs旨在提供一种基于场论、连续性和几何结构的生成框架，以克服自回归建模和扩散方法的局限，实现更自然的跨模态生成与物理结构化归纳偏置。

Method: SGFMs采用三个关键创新：1)将文本和视频统一为随机偏微分方程的轨迹的场论本体论；2)通过小波域表示实现稀疏性、尺度分离和计算效率；3)设计受约束的随机流以确保稳定性、连贯性和不确定性传播。该方法用局部算子、谱投影和类似Navier-Stokes的输运替代全局注意力机制。

Result: SGFMs定义了一种从根本上不同于自回归建模和扩散方法的生成架构。理论分析表明，该框架为下一代生成模型提供了实现长程连贯性、多模态通用性和物理结构化归纳偏倚的原理性路径，但具体实验验证结果在摘要中未提及。

Conclusion: 谱生成流模型代表了生成建模的新范式，它将物理原理与机器学习相结合，有望克服当前Transformer模型的局限性，为具有更好连贯性、效率和物理可解释性的下一代生成模型奠定基础。

Abstract: We introduce Spectral Generative Flow Models (SGFMs), a physics-inspired alternative to transformer-based large language models. Instead of representing text or video as sequences of discrete tokens processed by attention, SGFMs treat generation as the evolution of a continuous field governed by constrained stochastic dynamics in a multiscale wavelet basis. This formulation replaces global attention with local operators, spectral projections, and Navier--Stokes-like transport, yielding a generative mechanism grounded in continuity, geometry, and physical structure.
  Our framework provides three key innovations: (i) a field-theoretic ontology in which text and video are unified as trajectories of a stochastic partial differential equation; (ii) a wavelet-domain representation that induces sparsity, scale separation, and computational efficiency; and (iii) a constrained stochastic flow that enforces stability, coherence, and uncertainty propagation. Together, these components define a generative architecture that departs fundamentally from autoregressive modeling and diffusion-based approaches. SGFMs offer a principled path toward long-range coherence, multimodal generality, and physically structured inductive bias in next-generation generative models.

Motivation: 针对新兴市场（尤其是尼泊尔股市）金融时间序列的非线性和高波动性特点，探索梯度提升集成方法在股票指数预测中的有效性，并建立可复现的基准。

Method: 使用XGBoost回归器，特征包括滞后对数收益（最多30天）以及滚动波动率、RSI等技术指标；通过Optuna进行超参数优化，采用时间序列交叉验证；利用步行前向验证（扩展窗口和固定滚动窗口）进行样本外评估，避免前瞻性偏差。

Conclusion: 梯度提升集成能有效建模新兴市场时间序列的非线性动态，为NEPSE指数预测提供了可复现的基准。特征重要性分析和可视化增强了模型可解释性。

Abstract: This study develops a robust machine learning framework for one-step-ahead forecasting of daily log-returns in the Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) Index using the XGBoost regressor. A comprehensive feature set is engineered, including lagged log-returns (up to 30 days) and established technical indicators such as short- and medium-term rolling volatility measures and the 14-period Relative Strength Index. Hyperparameter optimization is performed using Optuna with time-series cross-validation on the initial training segment. Out-of-sample performance is rigorously assessed via walk-forward validation under both expanding and fixed-length rolling window schemes across multiple lag configurations, simulating real-world deployment and avoiding lookahead bias. Predictive accuracy is evaluated using root mean squared error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination (R-squared), and directional accuracy on both log-returns and reconstructed closing prices. Empirical results show that the optimal configuration, an expanding window with 20 lags, outperforms tuned ARIMA and Ridge regression benchmarks, achieving the lowest log-return RMSE (0.013450) and MAE (0.009814) alongside a directional accuracy of 65.15%. While the R-squared remains modest, consistent with the noisy nature of financial returns, primary emphasis is placed on relative error reduction and directional prediction. Feature importance analysis and visual inspection further enhance interpretability. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of gradient boosting ensembles in modeling nonlinear dynamics in volatile emerging market time series and establish a reproducible benchmark for NEPSE Index forecasting.

Abstract: Supply chain forecasting models degrade over time as real-world conditions change. Promotions shift, consumer preferences evolve, and supply disruptions alter demand patterns, causing what is known as concept drift. This silent degradation leads to stockouts or excess inventory without triggering any system warnings. Current industry practice relies on manual monitoring and scheduled retraining every 3-6 months, which wastes computational resources during stable periods while missing rapid drift events. Existing academic methods focus narrowly on drift detection without addressing diagnosis or remediation, and they ignore the hierarchical structure inherent in supply chain data. What retailers need is an end-to-end system that detects drift early, explains its root causes, and automatically corrects affected models. We propose DriftGuard, a five-module framework that addresses the complete drift lifecycle. The system combines an ensemble of four complementary detection methods, namely error-based monitoring, statistical tests, autoencoder anomaly detection, and Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) change-point analysis, with hierarchical propagation analysis to identify exactly where drift occurs across product lines. Once detected, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis diagnoses the root causes, and a cost-aware retraining strategy selectively updates only the most affected models. Evaluated on over 30,000 time series from the M5 retail dataset, DriftGuard achieves 97.8% detection recall within 4.2 days and delivers up to 417 return on investment through targeted remediation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models for molecular design, capable of capturing complex structural distributions and achieving high fidelity in 3D molecule generation. However, their widespread use remains constrained by long sampling trajectories, stochastic variance in the reverse process, and limited structural awareness in denoising dynamics. The Directly Denoising Diffusion Model (DDDM) mitigates these inefficiencies by replacing stochastic reverse MCMC updates with deterministic denoising step, substantially reducing inference time. Yet, the theoretical underpinnings of such deterministic updates have remained opaque. In this work, we provide a principled reinterpretation of DDDM through the lens of the Reverse Transition Kernel (RTK) framework by Huang et al. 2024, unifying deterministic and stochastic diffusion under a shared probabilistic formalism. By expressing the DDDM reverse process as an approximate kernel operator, we show that the direct denoising process implicitly optimizes a structured transport map between noisy and clean samples. This perspective elucidates why deterministic denoising achieves efficient inference. Beyond theoretical clarity, this reframing resolves several long-standing bottlenecks in molecular diffusion. The RTK view ensures numerical stability by enforcing well-conditioned reverse kernels, improves sample consistency by eliminating stochastic variance, and enables scalable and symmetry-preserving denoisers that respect SE(3) equivariance. Empirically, we demonstrate that RTK-guided deterministic denoising achieves faster convergence and higher structural fidelity than stochastic diffusion models, while preserving chemical validity across GEOM-DRUGS dataset. Code, models, and datasets are publicly available in our project repository.

Motivation: 随着数据流处理中窗口规模增大，窗口级别的公平性控制过于粗糙，需要在更细粒度级别上实施组公平性以保证数据处理的公正性。

Method: 设计了基于草图的数据结构来高效监控滑动窗口是否满足块级组公平性；开发了具有理论保障的最优高效算法来处理公平性违规时的窗口重新排序问题。

Conclusion: 块级公平性相比窗口级公平性具有明显优势，所提方法在实际流处理场景中具有高效性和实用性，能够在细粒度上有效保证组公平性。

Abstract: We study the problem of enforcing continuous group fairness over windows in data streams. We propose a novel fairness model that ensures group fairness at a finer granularity level (referred to as block) within each sliding window. This formulation is particularly useful when the window size is large, making it desirable to enforce fairness at a finer granularity. Within this framework, we address two key challenges: efficiently monitoring whether each sliding window satisfies block-level group fairness, and reordering the current window as effectively as possible when fairness is violated. To enable real-time monitoring, we design sketch-based data structures that maintain attribute distributions with minimal overhead. We also develop optimal, efficient algorithms for the reordering task, supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees. Our evaluation on four real-world streaming scenarios demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach. We achieve millisecond-level processing and a throughput of approximately 30,000 queries per second on average, depending on system parameters. The stream reordering algorithm improves block-level group fairness by up to 95% in certain cases, and by 50-60% on average across datasets. A qualitative study further highlights the advantages of block-level fairness compared to window-level fairness.

Method: 开发Energy Consumption Optimiser（ECOpt）超参数调优器，量化能耗效率与模型性能之间的权衡关系，生成可解释的帕累托前沿。

Result: 研究表明参数量和浮点运算量不能可靠地代表能耗，Transformer文本生成模型的能耗效率在不同硬件上相对一致。ECOpt能产生净正环境影响，并在CIFAR-10上发现7个在准确率和能耗效率方面均优于现有水平的模型。

Conclusion: ECOpt使ML从业者能在能耗成本、环境影响和模型效益间做出明智决策，同时符合新法规。研究成果支持测量和发布ML模型的能耗指标。

Abstract: The ubiquity of machine learning (ML) and the demand for ever-larger models bring an increase in energy consumption and environmental impact. However, little is known about the energy scaling laws in ML, and existing research focuses on training cost -- ignoring the larger cost of inference. Furthermore, tools for measuring the energy consumption of ML do not provide actionable feedback.
  To address these gaps, we developed Energy Consumption Optimiser (ECOpt): a hyperparameter tuner that optimises for energy efficiency and model performance. ECOpt quantifies the trade-off between these metrics as an interpretable Pareto frontier. This enables ML practitioners to make informed decisions about energy cost and environmental impact, while maximising the benefit of their models and complying with new regulations.
  Using ECOpt, we show that parameter and floating-point operation counts can be unreliable proxies for energy consumption, and observe that the energy efficiency of Transformer models for text generation is relatively consistent across hardware. These findings motivate measuring and publishing the energy metrics of ML models. We further show that ECOpt can have a net positive environmental impact and use it to uncover seven models for CIFAR-10 that improve upon the state of the art, when considering accuracy and energy efficiency together.

Abstract: Differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) suffers from slow convergence under tight privacy budgets due to the overwhelming noise introduced to preserve privacy. While adaptive optimizers can accelerate convergence, existing second-order methods such as DP-FedNew require O(d^2) memory at each client to maintain local feature covariance matrices, making them impractical for high-dimensional models. We propose DP-FedSOFIM, a server-side second-order optimization framework that leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) as a natural gradient preconditioner while requiring only O(d) memory per client. By employing the Sherman-Morrison formula for efficient matrix inversion, DP-FedSOFIM achieves O(d) computational complexity per round while maintaining the convergence benefits of second-order methods. Our analysis proves that the server-side preconditioning preserves (epsilon, delta)-differential privacy through the post-processing theorem. Empirical evaluation on CIFAR-10 demonstrates that DP-FedSOFIM achieves superior test accuracy compared to first-order baselines across multiple privacy regimes.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of solar energetic particle events is vital for safeguarding satellites, astronauts, and space-based infrastructure. Modern space weather monitoring generates massive volumes of high-frequency, multivariate time series (MVTS) data from sources such as the Geostationary perational Environmental Satellites (GOES). Machine learning (ML) models trained on this data show strong predictive power, but most existing methods overlook domain-specific feasibility constraints. Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a key tool for improving model interpretability, yet existing approaches rarely enforce physical plausibility. This work introduces a Physics-Guided Counterfactual Explanation framework, a novel method for generating counterfactual explanations in time series classification tasks that remain consistent with underlying physical principles. Applied to solar energetic particles (SEP) forecasting, this framework achieves over 80% reduction in Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance increasing the proximity, produces counterfactual explanations with higher sparsity, and reduces runtime by nearly 50% compared to state-of-the-art baselines such as DiCE. Beyond numerical improvements, this framework ensures that generated counterfactual explanations are physically plausible and actionable in scientific domains. In summary, the framework generates counterfactual explanations that are both valid and physically consistent, while laying the foundation for scalable counterfactual generation in big data environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Warmup Stable Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler has recently become popular, largely due to its good performance and flexibility when training large language models. It remains an open question whether the remarkable performance of WSD - using a decaying learning rate for only a fraction of training compared to cosine decay - is a phenomenon specific to transformer-based language models that can potentially offer new theoretical insights into their training dynamics. Inspired by the usage of learning rate schedulers as a new lens into understanding landscape geometry (e.g., river valley, connected minima, progressive sharpening), in this work we compare the WSD path of the Adam optimizer on a Pythia-like language model to that of a small CNN trained to classify CIFAR10 images. We observe most training signals, optimizer path features, and sharpness dynamics to be qualitatively similar in such architectures. This consistency points to shared geometric characteristics of the loss landscapes of old and new nonconvex problems, and hints to future research questions around the geometry of high dimensional optimization problems.

Abstract: Across engineering and scientific domains, traditional deep learning (TDL) models perform well when training and test data share the same distribution. However, the dynamic nature of real-world data, broadly termed \textit{data shift}, renders TDL models prone to rapid performance degradation, requiring costly relabeling and inefficient retraining. Meta-learning, which enables models to adapt quickly to new data with few examples, offers a promising alternative for mitigating these challenges. Here, we systematically compare TDL with fine-tuning and optimization-based meta-learning algorithms to assess their ability to address data shift in time-series classification. We introduce a controlled, task-oriented seismic benchmark (SeisTask) and show that meta-learning typically achieves faster and more stable adaptation with reduced overfitting in data-scarce regimes and smaller model architectures. As data availability and model capacity increase, its advantages diminish, with TDL with fine-tuning performing comparably. Finally, we examine how task diversity influences meta-learning and find that alignment between training and test distributions, rather than diversity alone, drives performance gains. Overall, this work provides a systematic evaluation of when and why meta-learning outperforms TDL under data shift and contributes SeisTask as a benchmark for advancing adaptive learning research in time-series domains.

Abstract: This work addresses the fundamental problem of unbounded metric movement costs in bandit online convex optimization, by considering high-dimensional dynamic quadratic hitting costs and $\ell_2$-norm switching costs in a noisy bandit feedback model. For a general class of stochastic environments, we provide the first algorithm SCaLE that provably achieves a distribution-agnostic sub-linear dynamic regret, without the knowledge of hitting cost structure. En-route, we present a novel spectral regret analysis that separately quantifies eigenvalue-error driven regret and eigenbasis-perturbation driven regret. Extensive numerical experiments, against online-learning baselines, corroborate our claims, and highlight statistical consistency of our algorithm.

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) aims to discover shared cluster structures from multi-view data with partial observations. The core challenges lie in accurately imputing missing views without introducing bias, while maintaining semantic consistency across views and compactness within clusters. To address these challenges, we propose DIMVC-HIA, a novel deep IMVC framework that integrates hierarchical imputation and alignment with four key components: (1) view-specific autoencoders for latent feature extraction, coupled with a view-shared clustering predictor to produce soft cluster assignments; (2) a hierarchical imputation module that first estimates missing cluster assignments based on cross-view contrastive similarity, and then reconstructs missing features using intra-view, intra-cluster statistics; (3) an energy-based semantic alignment module, which promotes intra-cluster compactness by minimizing energy variance around low-energy cluster anchors; and (4) a contrastive assignment alignment module, which enhances cross-view consistency and encourages confident, well-separated cluster predictions. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance under varying levels of missingness.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The existence of multiple, equally accurate models for a given predictive task leads to predictive multiplicity, where a ``Rashomon set'' of models achieve similar accuracy but diverges in their individual predictions. This inconsistency undermines trust in high-stakes applications where we want consistent predictions. We propose three approaches to reduce inconsistency among predictions for the members of the Rashomon set. The first approach is \textbf{outlier correction}. An outlier has a label that none of the good models are capable of predicting correctly. Outliers can cause the Rashomon set to have high variance predictions in a local area, so fixing them can lower variance. Our second approach is local patching. In a local region around a test point, models may disagree with each other because some of them are biased. We can detect and fix such biases using a validation set, which also reduces multiplicity. Our third approach is pairwise reconciliation, where we find pairs of models that disagree on a region around the test point. We modify predictions that disagree, making them less biased. These three approaches can be used together or separately, and they each have distinct advantages. The reconciled predictions can then be distilled into a single interpretable model for real-world deployment. In experiments across multiple datasets, our methods reduce disagreement metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present Speculative Rollout with Tree-Structured Cache (SRT), a simple, model-free approach to accelerate on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for language models without sacrificing distributional correctness. SRT exploits the empirical similarity of rollouts for the same prompt across training steps by storing previously generated continuations in a per-prompt tree-structured cache. During generation, the current policy uses this tree as the draft model for performing speculative decoding. To keep the cache fresh and improve draft model quality, SRT updates trees online from ongoing rollouts and proactively performs run-ahead generation during idle GPU bubbles. Integrated into standard RL pipelines (\textit{e.g.}, PPO, GRPO and DAPO) and multi-turn settings, SRT consistently reduces generation and step latency and lowers per-token inference cost, achieving up to 2.08x wall-clock time speedup during rollout.

Result: 在三个模型规模（1.5B、7B、8B）、三个GRPO变体和五个数学推理基准上的评估显示，MMR-GRPO实现可比峰值性能的同时，平均减少47.9%训练步数和70.2%的墙上时钟时间

Conclusion: MMR-GRPO通过利用解决方案多样性提供更多信息更新，显著加速GRPO收敛，且效果在不同模型、方法和基准上表现一致

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has become a standard approach for training mathematical reasoning models; however, its reliance on multiple completions per prompt makes training computationally expensive. Although recent work has reduced the number of training steps required to reach peak performance, the overall wall-clock training time often remains unchanged or even increases due to higher per-step cost. We propose MMR-GRPO, which integrates Maximal Marginal Relevance to reweigh rewards based on completion diversity. Our key insight is that semantically redundant completions contribute limited marginal learning signal; prioritizing diverse solutions yields more informative updates and accelerates convergence. Extensive evaluations across three model sizes (1.5B, 7B, 8B), three GRPO variants, and five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that MMR-GRPO achieves comparable peak performance while requiring on average 47.9% fewer training steps and 70.2% less wall-clock time. These gains are consistent across models, methods, and benchmarks. We will release our code, trained models, and experimental protocols.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce DASD-4B-Thinking, a lightweight yet highly capable, fully open-source reasoning model. It achieves SOTA performance among open-source models of comparable scale across challenging benchmarks in mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation -- even outperforming several larger models. We begin by critically reexamining a widely adopted distillation paradigm in the community: SFT on teacher-generated responses, also known as sequence-level distillation. Although a series of recent works following this scheme have demonstrated remarkable efficiency and strong empirical performance, they are primarily grounded in the SFT perspective. Consequently, these approaches focus predominantly on designing heuristic rules for SFT data filtering, while largely overlooking the core principle of distillation itself -- enabling the student model to learn the teacher's full output distribution so as to inherit its generalization capability. Specifically, we identify three critical limitations in current practice: i) Inadequate representation of the teacher's sequence-level distribution; ii) Misalignment between the teacher's output distribution and the student's learning capacity; and iii) Exposure bias arising from teacher-forced training versus autoregressive inference. In summary, these shortcomings reflect a systemic absence of explicit teacher-student interaction throughout the distillation process, leaving the essence of distillation underexploited. To address these issues, we propose several methodological innovations that collectively form an enhanced sequence-level distillation training pipeline. Remarkably, DASD-4B-Thinking obtains competitive results using only 448K training samples -- an order of magnitude fewer than those employed by most existing open-source efforts. To support community research, we publicly release our models and the training dataset.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance reasoning capabilities through test-time scaling by generating multiple traces. However, the combination of lengthy reasoning traces with multiple sampling introduces substantial computation and high end-to-end latency. Prior work on accelerating this process has relied on similarity-based or confidence-based pruning, but these signals do not reliably indicate trace quality. To address these limitations, we propose STEP: Step-level Trace Evaluation and Pruning, a novel pruning framework that evaluates reasoning steps using hidden states and dynamically prunes unpromising traces during generation. We train a lightweight step scorer to estimate trace quality, and design a GPU memory-aware pruning strategy that triggers pruning as the GPU memory is saturated by KV cache to reduce end-to-end latency. Experiments across challenging reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that STEP reduces end-to-end inference latency by 45%-70% on average compared to self-consistency while also improving reasoning accuracy.

Abstract: Concrete is the most widely used construction material worldwide; however, reliable prediction of compressive strength remains challenging due to material heterogeneity, variable mix proportions, and sensitivity to field and environmental conditions. Recent advances in artificial intelligence enable data-driven modeling frameworks capable of supporting automated decision-making in construction quality control. This study leverages an industry-scale dataset consisting of approximately 70,000 compressive strength test records to evaluate and compare multiple predictive approaches, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, transformer-based neural networks, and embedding-based neural networks. The models incorporate key mixture design and placement variables such as water cement ratio, cementitious material content, slump, air content, temperature, and placement conditions. Results indicate that the embedding-based neural network consistently outperforms traditional machine learning and transformer-based models, achieving a mean 28-day prediction error of approximately 2.5%. This level of accuracy is comparable to routine laboratory testing variability, demonstrating the potential of embedding-based learning frameworks to enable automated, data-driven quality control and decision support in large-scale construction operations.

TL;DR: 该论文针对心电信号分类中数据类别不平衡和噪声问题，提出基于小波变换的特征融合方法，显著提升了心电分类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心电数据的类别不平衡（某些心脏病类型在数据集中代表性不足）和采集过程中的噪声干扰，严重影响了深度学习心电分类算法的性能和鲁棒性，而现有方法对于特定类型心电信号的生成和过采样技术的效果缺乏共识。

Abstract: Imbalanced electrocardiogram (ECG) data hampers the efficacy and resilience of algorithms in the automated processing and interpretation of cardiovascular diagnostic information, which in turn impedes deep learning-based ECG classification. Notably, certain cardiac conditions that are infrequently encountered are disproportionately underrepresented in these datasets. Although algorithmic generation and oversampling of specific ECG signal types can mitigate class skew, there is a lack of consensus regarding the effectiveness of such techniques in ECG classification. Furthermore, the methodologies and scenarios of ECG acquisition introduce noise, further complicating the processing of ECG data. This paper presents a significantly enhanced ECG classifier that simultaneously addresses both class imbalance and noise-related challenges in ECG analysis, as observed in the CPSC 2018 dataset. Specifically, we propose the application of feature fusion based on the wavelet transform, with a focus on wavelet transform-based interclass fusion, to generate the training feature library and the test set feature library. Subsequently, the original training and test data are amalgamated with their respective feature databases, resulting in more balanced training and test datasets. Employing this approach, our ECG model achieves recognition accuracies of up to 99%, 98%, 97%, 98%, 96%, 92%, and 93% for Normal, AF, I-AVB, LBBB, RBBB, PAC, PVC, STD, and STE, respectively. Furthermore, the average recognition accuracy for these categories ranges between 92\% and 98\%. Notably, our proposed data fusion methodology surpasses any known algorithms in terms of ECG classification accuracy in the CPSC 2018 dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有财报电话会议中闪避回答检测的研究进展受阻于缺乏大规模标注数据集。作者旨在填补这一空白，同时发现模型间标注分歧可作为高质量训练样本的有效筛选机制。

Method: 构建EvasionBench数据集（含30k训练样本和1k人工标注测试集）。提出多模型标注框架：利用两个前沿大语言模型对样本进行标注，当二者冲突时，引入第三个法官模型进行裁决。这种基于分歧挖掘的标注策略能高效识别困难样本。训练4B参数的Eva-4B模型。

Result: 1. 多模型分歧挖掘框架在准确率上超越单模型蒸馏方法2.4个百分点。
2. 尽管法官裁决样本带来更高训练损失（0.421 vs 0.393），但提升了模型泛化能力，表明分歧挖掘起到隐式正则化作用。
3. Eva-4B模型达到81.3%的准确率，比基础模型提升25个百分点，接近前沿大语言模型性能，而推理成本大幅降低。测试集标注者间一致性高达Cohen's Kappa 0.835。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型间标注分歧挖掘的标注策略是构建高质量训练数据集的有效方法。通过该框架训练的轻量级模型能在闪避回答检测任务上达到接近前沿大语言模型的性能，同时保持较低推理成本，为金融文本分析提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting evasive answers in earnings calls is critical for financial transparency, yet progress is hindered by the lack of large-scale benchmarks. We introduce EvasionBench, comprising 30,000 training samples and 1,000 human-annotated test samples (Cohen's Kappa 0.835) across three evasion levels. Our key contribution is a multi-model annotation framework leveraging a core insight: disagreement between frontier LLMs signals hard examples most valuable for training. We mine boundary cases where two strong annotators conflict, using a judge to resolve labels. This approach outperforms single-model distillation by 2.4 percent, with judge-resolved samples improving generalization despite higher training loss (0.421 vs 0.393) - evidence that disagreement mining acts as implicit regularization. Our trained model Eva-4B (4B parameters) achieves 81.3 percent accuracy, outperforming its base by 25 percentage points and approaching frontier LLM performance at a fraction of inference cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 针对几何变化导致拓扑结构、边界条件等离散结构突变的问题，提出离散解算子学习（DiSOL）范式，通过离散求解过程建模而非连续函数空间映射，实现对几何主导问题的稳定求解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前神经算子学习通过逼近连续函数空间间的算子映射来加速偏微分方程求解，但在许多工程场景中，几何形状的变化会引发离散结构的突变（如拓扑变化、边界条件不连续、计算域变化等），破坏了连续平滑变化的前提假设。

Method: DiSOL将求解器分解为与经典离散化方法对应的可学习阶段：局部贡献编码、多尺度组装以及在嵌入网格上的隐式解重构。这种因子化保持了过程级的一致性，同时适应了几何相关的离散结构变化。

Result: 在几何相关的泊松方程、对流扩散、线性弹性以及时空热传导问题的测试中，DiSOL在分布内和强分布外几何（包括不连续边界和拓扑变化）下均能产生稳定且准确的预测结果。

Conclusion: 结果强调了在几何主导领域中过程化算子表示的必要性，并将离散解算子学习定位为科学机器学习中一个独特且互补的研究方向。

Abstract: Neural operator learning accelerates PDE solution by approximating operators as mappings between continuous function spaces. Yet in many engineering settings, varying geometry induces discrete structural changes, including topological changes, abrupt changes in boundary conditions or boundary types, and changes in the effective computational domain, which break the smooth-variation premise. Here we introduce Discrete Solution Operator Learning (DiSOL), a complementary paradigm that learns discrete solution procedures rather than continuous function-space operators. DiSOL factorizes the solver into learnable stages that mirror classical discretizations: local contribution encoding, multiscale assembly, and implicit solution reconstruction on an embedded grid, thereby preserving procedure-level consistency while adapting to geometry-dependent discrete structures. Across geometry-dependent Poisson, advection-diffusion, linear elasticity, as well as spatiotemporal heat-conduction problems, DiSOL produces stable and accurate predictions under both in-distribution and strongly out-of-distribution geometries, including discontinuous boundaries and topological changes. These results highlight the need for procedural operator representations in geometry-dominated regimes and position discrete solution operator learning as a distinct, complementary direction in scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Using Artificial Intelligence to improve teaching and learning benefits greater adaptivity and scalability in education. Knowledge Tracing (KT) is recognized for student modeling task due to its superior performance and application potential in education. To this end, we conceptualize and investigate counterfactual explanation as the connection from XAI for KT to education. Counterfactual explanations offer actionable recourse, are inherently causal and local, and easy for educational stakeholders to understand who are often non-experts. We propose KTCF, a counterfactual explanation generation method for KT that accounts for knowledge concept relationships, and a post-processing scheme that converts a counterfactual explanation into a sequence of educational instructions. We experiment on a large-scale educational dataset and show our KTCF method achieves superior and robust performance over existing methods, with improvements ranging from 5.7% to 34% across metrics. Additionally, we provide a qualitative evaluation of our post-processing scheme, demonstrating that the resulting educational instructions help in reducing large study burden. We show that counterfactuals have the potential to advance the responsible and practical use of AI in education. Future works on XAI for KT may benefit from educationally grounded conceptualization and developing stakeholder-centered methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究针对带置信度设置的Bandit Clustering问题，提出两种高效渐近最优算法：EBC每步仅向最优解单步逼近而非完全求解，EBC-H进一步简化为基于停止规则计算的启发式选择，均显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Bandit Clustering算法假设高斯分布且每步需求解复杂优化问题，计算代价高昂，需要拓展到更广泛的参数分布族并提升计算效率。

Method: 提出EBC算法：在向量参数化分布族（满足正则条件）下，每步采样规则仅向最优值单步逼近而非完全求解；提出EBC-H启发式变体：基于停止规则计算的量直接选择臂，进一步简化。

Result: 计算实验显示EBC和EBC-H每样本运行时间显著低于现有算法；合成数据集验证了EBC的渐近最优性；合成与真实数据集均显示性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EBC和EBC-H在保持渐近最优性的同时大幅提升计算效率，为更广泛分布类别的Bandit Clustering问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We study the Bandit Clustering (BC) problem under the fixed confidence setting, where the objective is to group a collection of data sequences (arms) into clusters through sequential sampling from adaptively selected arms at each time step while ensuring a fixed error probability at the stopping time. We consider a setting where arms in a cluster may have different distributions. Unlike existing results in this setting, which assume Gaussian-distributed arms, we study a broader class of vector-parametric distributions that satisfy mild regularity conditions. Existing asymptotically optimal BC algorithms require solving an optimization problem as part of their sampling rule at each step, which is computationally costly. We propose an Efficient Bandit Clustering algorithm (EBC), which, instead of solving the full optimization problem, takes a single step toward the optimal value at each time step, making it computationally efficient while remaining asymptotically optimal. We also propose a heuristic variant of EBC, called EBC-H, which further simplifies the sampling rule, with arm selection based on quantities computed as part of the stopping rule. We highlight the computational efficiency of EBC and EBC-H by comparing their per-sample run time with that of existing algorithms. The asymptotic optimality of EBC is supported through simulations on the synthetic datasets. Through simulations on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we show the performance gain of EBC and EBC-H over existing approaches.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于算子的多教师知识蒸馏公理化理论框架，定义了五个核心公理来规范知识聚合算子，证明了满足这些公理的算子族存在且不唯一，并建立了算子无关的理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前多教师知识蒸馏缺乏统一的理论框架，研究者通常在特定聚合公式上进行分析，缺乏对基础聚合原则的系统性探讨。本文旨在建立一个公理化的算子理论框架，为多教师知识蒸馏提供理论基础，以解释不同聚合方法的共同原理。

Method: 基于Sparse-KD的概率域蒸馏框架，提出五个核心公理：凸性、正性、连续性、权重单调性和温度一致性。通过算子理论方法，证明满足这些公理的算子族存在且不唯一，并分析各类算子的理论性质。

Result: 建立了算子无关的理论保证：多教师聚合能同时减少随机方差和系统性监督偏差；提供了Jensen型界限、对数损失保证和安全衰减特性；对于权重线性的算子，在标准独立性假设下证明了经典的集成方差减少结果，并扩展到相关误差机制。

Conclusion: 该框架为从多样化前沿模型进行多教师知识蒸馏提供了理论基础，同时允许多种有效的实现策略。这为理解不同聚合方法的内在一致性提供了理论支撑，促进了知识蒸馏的理论发展和实际应用。

Abstract: Building on the probability-domain distillation framework of Sparse-KD, we develop an axiomatic, operator-theoretic framework for multi-teacher ensemble knowledge distillation. Rather than prescribing a specific aggregation formula, we define five core axioms governing valid knowledge aggregation operators, encompassing convexity, positivity, continuity, weight monotonicity, and temperature coherence. We prove the existence and non-uniqueness of operator families satisfying these axioms, establishing that multiple distinct aggregation mechanisms conform to the same foundational principles.
  Within this framework, we establish operator-agnostic guarantees showing that multi-teacher aggregation reduces both stochastic variance and systematic supervisory bias under heterogeneous teachers, while providing Jensen-type bounds, log-loss guarantees, and safety attenuation properties. For aggregation operators linear in teacher weights, we further establish classical ensemble variance-reduction results under standard independence assumptions, with extensions to correlated-error regimes. The framework provides theoretical grounding for multi-teacher distillation from diverse frontier models while admitting multiple valid implementation strategies.

*Prashant C. Raju*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了几何稳定性作为表征分析的新维度，用于衡量表征结构在扰动下的可靠性，并开发了Shesha框架进行测量。研究表明稳定性与相似性在经验上不相关，且具有不同的机制特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前表征分析主要关注相似性（衡量嵌入与外参基准的对齐程度），这只揭示了表征内容，但无法评估结构是否稳健。为解决这一盲点，需要量化表征几何在扰动下的可靠性。

Method: 引入几何稳定性作为新维度，开发Shesha测量框架。在7个领域的2,463种配置中实证评估，比较稳定性与相似性（如CKA）的关系，分析二者的机制区别（通过主成分移除实验），并探索稳定性在安全监控、可控性、模型选择等多种场景的应用价值。

Result: 1) 稳定性与相似性经验相关系数ρ≈0.01，基本不相关；2) 机制上：移除顶层主成分后相似性度量失效，而稳定性仍能感知细粒度流形结构；3) 应用验证：安全监控中，稳定性检测结构漂移的敏感性比CKA高近2倍，同时降低误报；可控性预测中，监督稳定性与线性可操纵性高度相关（ρ=0.89-0.96）；模型选择中，稳定性与可转移性呈现解耦，揭示迁移优化产生的几何代价。

Conclusion: 几何稳定性通过量化系统维持结构的可靠性，为表征审计提供了相似性的必要补充，适用于计算和生物系统的分析，在安全监控、可控性预测、模型选择等任务上具有应用价值。

Abstract: Analysis of learned representations has a blind spot: it focuses on $similarity$, measuring how closely embeddings align with external references, but similarity reveals only what is represented, not whether that structure is robust. We introduce $geometric$ $stability$, a distinct dimension that quantifies how reliably representational geometry holds under perturbation, and present $Shesha$, a framework for measuring it. Across 2,463 configurations in seven domains, we show that stability and similarity are empirically uncorrelated ($ρ\approx 0.01$) and mechanistically distinct: similarity metrics collapse after removing the top principal components, while stability retains sensitivity to fine-grained manifold structure. This distinction yields actionable insights: for safety monitoring, stability acts as a functional geometric canary, detecting structural drift nearly 2$\times$ more sensitively than CKA while filtering out the non-functional noise that triggers false alarms in rigid distance metrics; for controllability, supervised stability predicts linear steerability ($ρ= 0.89$-$0.96$); for model selection, stability dissociates from transferability, revealing a geometric tax that transfer optimization incurs. Beyond machine learning, stability predicts CRISPR perturbation coherence and neural-behavioral coupling. By quantifying $how$ $reliably$ systems maintain structure, geometric stability provides a necessary complement to similarity for auditing representations across biological and computational systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant deployment challenges due to their massive computational demands. % While pruning offers a promising compression solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (1) They neglect activation distribution shifts between calibration data and test data, resulting in inaccurate error estimations; (2) They overlook the long-tail distribution characteristics of activations in the attention module. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel pruning method, $D^2Prune$. First, we propose a dual Taylor expansion-based method that jointly models weight and activation perturbations for precise error estimation, leading to precise pruning mask selection and weight updating and facilitating error minimization during pruning. % Second, we propose an attention-aware dynamic update strategy that preserves the long-tail attention pattern by jointly minimizing the KL divergence of attention distributions and the reconstruction error. Extensive experiments show that $D^2Prune$ consistently outperforms SOTA methods across various LLMs (e.g., OPT-125M, LLaMA2/3, and Qwen3). Moreover, the dynamic attention update mechanism also generalizes well to ViT-based vision models like DeiT, achieving superior accuracy on ImageNet-1K.

Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的MTPP方法主要通过位置编码引入时间信息，依赖共享或参数化衰减结构，难以捕捉异构和类型特定的时间效应。

Method: 从多元Hawkes过程理论推导新型注意力算子Hawkes Attention，使用可学习的类型特定神经核调制query、key和value投影，替代传统注意力中的相应部分。

Result: 实验表明该方法相比基线取得更好性能，除通用MTPP外，该机制也能轻松应用于时间序列预测等特定时序结构。

Conclusion: Hawkes Attention通过神经核统一学习时间相关行为和类型特定激发模式，有效改进MTPP建模能力。

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Processes (MTPPs) arise naturally in medical, social, commercial, and financial domains. However, existing Transformer-based methods mostly inject temporal information only via positional encodings, relying on shared or parametric decay structures, which limits their ability to capture heterogeneous and type-specific temporal effects. Inspired by this observation, we derive a novel attention operator called Hawkes Attention from the multivariate Hawkes process theory for MTPP, using learnable per-type neural kernels to modulate query, key and value projections, thereby replacing the corresponding parts in the traditional attention. Benefited from the design, Hawkes Attention unifies event timing and content interaction, learning both the time-relevant behavior and type-specific excitation patterns from the data. The experimental results show that our method achieves better performance compared to the baselines. In addition to the general MTPP, our attention mechanism can also be easily applied to specific temporal structures, such as time series forecasting.

Motivation: 主流的大型推理模型后训练范式（监督微调+强化学习）存在内在的优化不匹配：SFT的刚性监督会导致分布坍塌，耗尽后续RL所需的探索空间。

Method: 提出GIFT（Gibbs Initialization with Finite Temperature），将SFT重新表述为统一后训练框架的一部分，将监督视为有限温度的能量势能，建立分布桥接以确保整个后训练流程的目标一致性。

Conclusion: GIFT通过引入有限温度机制解决了SFT在后续RL中的优化不匹配问题，为大语言模型后训练提供了理论严谨且有效的新范式。

Abstract: The prevailing post-training paradigm for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs)--Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL)--suffers from an intrinsic optimization mismatch: the rigid supervision inherent in SFT induces distributional collapse, thereby exhausting the exploration space necessary for subsequent RL. In this paper, we reformulate SFT within a unified post-training framework and propose Gibbs Initialization with Finite Temperature (GIFT). We characterize standard SFT as a degenerate zero-temperature limit that suppresses base priors. Conversely, GIFT incorporates supervision as a finite-temperature energy potential, establishing a distributional bridge that ensures objective consistency throughout the post-training pipeline. Our experiments demonstrate that GIFT significantly outperforms standard SFT and other competitive baselines when utilized for RL initialization, providing a mathematically principled pathway toward achieving global optimality in post-training.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reward design remains a significant bottleneck in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world problems. A popular alternative is reward learning, where reward functions are inferred from human feedback rather than manually specified. Recent work has proposed learning reward functions from human feedback in the form of ratings, rather than traditional binary preferences, enabling richer and potentially less cognitively demanding supervision. Building on this paradigm, we introduce a new rating-based RL method, Ranked Return Regression for RL (R4). At its core, R4 employs a novel ranking mean squared error (rMSE) loss, which treats teacher-provided ratings as ordinal targets. Our approach learns from a dataset of trajectory-rating pairs, where each trajectory is labeled with a discrete rating (e.g., "bad," "neutral," "good"). At each training step, we sample a set of trajectories, predict their returns, and rank them using a differentiable sorting operator (soft ranks). We then optimize a mean squared error loss between the resulting soft ranks and the teacher's ratings. Unlike prior rating-based approaches, R4 offers formal guarantees: its solution set is provably minimal and complete under mild assumptions. Empirically, using simulated human feedback, we demonstrate that R4 consistently matches or outperforms existing rating and preference-based RL methods on robotic locomotion benchmarks from OpenAI Gym and the DeepMind Control Suite, while requiring significantly less feedback.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Despite the prevalent assumption of uniform variable importance in long-term time series forecasting models, real world applications often exhibit asymmetric causal relationships and varying data acquisition costs. Specifically, cost-effective exogenous data (e.g., local weather) can unilaterally influence dynamics of endogenous variables, such as lake surface temperature. Exploiting these links enables more effective forecasts when exogenous inputs are readily available. Transformer-based models capture long-range dependencies but incur high computation and suffer from permutation invariance. Patch-based variants improve efficiency yet can miss local temporal patterns. To efficiently exploit informative signals across both the temporal dimension and relevant exogenous variables, this study proposes XLinear, a lightweight time series forecasting model built upon MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs). XLinear uses a global token derived from an endogenous variable as a pivotal hub for interacting with exogenous variables, and employs MLPs with sigmoid activation to extract both temporal patterns and variate-wise dependencies. Its prediction head then integrates these signals to forecast the endogenous series. We evaluate XLinear on seven standard benchmarks and five real-world datasets with exogenous inputs. Compared with state-of-the-art models, XLinear delivers superior accuracy and efficiency for both multivariate forecasts and univariate forecasts influenced by exogenous inputs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) systems involve distinct physical domains, fluid and solid, governed by different partial differential equations and coupled at a dynamic interface. While learning-based solvers offer a promising alternative to costly numerical simulations, existing methods struggle to capture the heterogeneous dynamics of FSI within a unified framework. This challenge is further exacerbated by inconsistencies in response across domains due to interface coupling and by disparities in learning difficulty across fluid and solid regions, leading to instability during prediction. To address these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Graph Attention Solver (HGATSolver). HGATSolver encodes the system as a heterogeneous graph, embedding physical structure directly into the model via distinct node and edge types for fluid, solid, and interface regions. This enables specialized message-passing mechanisms tailored to each physical domain. To stabilize explicit time stepping, we introduce a novel physics-conditioned gating mechanism that serves as a learnable, adaptive relaxation factor. Furthermore, an Inter-domain Gradient-Balancing Loss dynamically balances the optimization objectives across domains based on predictive uncertainty. Extensive experiments on two constructed FSI benchmarks and a public dataset demonstrate that HGATSolver achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing an effective framework for surrogate modeling of coupled multi-physics systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) are standard for LLM alignment, they either rely on costly expert data or discard valuable negative samples, leading to data inefficiency. To address this, we propose Reward Informed Fine-Tuning (RIFT), a simple yet effective framework that utilizes all self-generated samples. Unlike the hard thresholding of RFT, RIFT repurposes negative trajectories, reweighting the loss with scalar rewards to learn from both the positive and negative trajectories from the model outputs. To overcome the training collapse caused by naive reward integration, where direct multiplication yields an unbounded loss, we introduce a stabilized loss formulation that ensures numerical robustness and optimization efficiency. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks across various base models show that RIFT consistently outperforms RFT.

TL;DR: 论文提出元认知调控框架MTR，通过自我诊断机制在不依赖外部标注或显式腐败模型的情况下，自主评估经验可信度以应对不可观测可靠性学习难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不可观测可靠性的学习场景中，可靠与不可靠反馈可能在局部不可区分，传统的鲁棒学习方法可能形成高置信度的系统错误信念。需要一种机制来决定是否从经验中学习，而不仅仅是学习稳定性问题。

Method: 提出监测-信任-调控器(MTR)模块化分解框架，通过自我诊断机制维护缓慢变化的经验信任变量，该变量从学习者内部动态中的内生证据推断经验可信度，并软调制学习更新。

Result: 在强化学习中实现了校准的怀疑和系统性奖励篡改下的恢复；在监督学习中揭示了性能恢复与认知恢复的关键分离，表明准确度反弹时内部信念动态仍可能被早期误导数据锁定。

Conclusion: MTR框架和自我诊断为不可观测可靠性下的自主学习提供了组织抽象和具体设计模板，通过内省诊断实现内在可靠性评估。

Abstract: Learning under unobservable feedback reliability poses a distinct challenge beyond optimization robustness: a system must decide whether to learn from an experience, not only how to learn stably. We study this setting as Epistemic Identifiability under Unobservable Reliability (EIUR), where each experience has a latent credibility, reliable and unreliable feedback can be locally indistinguishable, and data are generated in a closed loop by the learner's own evolving beliefs and actions. In EIUR, standard robust learning can converge stably yet form high-confidence, systematically wrong beliefs.
  We propose metacognitive regulation as a practical response: a second, introspective control loop that infers experience credibility from endogenous evidence in the learner's internal dynamics. We formalize this as a modular Monitor-Trust-Regulator (MTR) decomposition and instantiate it with self-diagnosis, which maintains a slowly varying experience-trust variable that softly modulates learning updates, without exogenous reliability labels or an explicit corruption model.
  Empirically, in the EIUR regimes studied here, self-diagnosis is associated with improved epistemic identifiability. In reinforcement learning, it enables calibrated skepticism and recovery under systematically corrupted rewards. In supervised learning, it exposes a critical dissociation: performance recovery does not imply epistemic recovery. Accuracy can rebound while internal belief dynamics remain locked-in by early misleading data, a failure detectable only through introspective diagnostics. Together, MTR and self-diagnosis provide an organizing abstraction and a concrete design template for intrinsic reliability assessment in autonomous learning under unobservable reliability.

Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous crystalline materials with broad applications such as carbon capture and drug delivery, yet accurately predicting their 3D structures remains a significant challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating crystals, their application to MOFs is hindered by MOFs' high atomic complexity. Inspired by the success of block-wise paradigms in deep generative models, we pioneer the use of LLMs in this domain by introducing MOF-LLM, the first LLM framework specifically adapted for block-level MOF structure prediction. To effectively harness LLMs for this modular assembly task, our training paradigm integrates spatial-aware continual pre-training (CPT), structural supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and matching-driven reinforcement learning (RL). By incorporating explicit spatial priors and optimizing structural stability via Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), our approach substantially enhances the spatial reasoning capability of a Qwen-3 8B model for accurate MOF structure prediction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MOF-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art denoising-based and LLM-based methods while exhibiting superior sampling efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is crucial for advancing large-scale reasoning models. However, existing parameter-efficient methods, such as PiSSA and MiLoRA, are designed for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and do not account for the distinct optimization dynamics and geometric structures of RLVR. Applying these methods directly leads to spectral collapse and optimization instability, which severely limit model performance. Meanwhile, alternative approaches that leverage update sparsity encounter significant efficiency bottlenecks on modern hardware due to unstructured computations. To address these challenges, we propose GeoRA (Geometry-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation), which exploits the anisotropic and compressible nature of RL update subspaces. GeoRA initializes adapters by extracting principal directions via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) within a geometrically constrained subspace while freezing the residual components. This method preserves the pre-trained geometric structure and enables efficient GPU computation through dense operators. Experiments on Qwen and Llama demonstrate that GeoRA mitigates optimization bottlenecks caused by geometric misalignment. It consistently outperforms established low-rank baselines on key mathematical benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Moreover, GeoRA shows superior generalization and resilience to catastrophic forgetting in out-of-domain tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces ACS2HER, a novel integration of the Anticipatory Classifier System (ACS2) with the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) mechanism. While ACS2 is highly effective at building cognitive maps through latent learning, its performance often stagnates in environments characterized by sparse rewards. We propose a specific architectural variant that triggers hindsight learning when the agent fails to reach its primary goal, re-labeling visited states as virtual goals to densify the learning signal. The proposed model was evaluated on two benchmarks: the deterministic \texttt{Maze 6} and the stochastic \texttt{FrozenLake}. The results demonstrate that ACS2HER significantly accelerates knowledge acquisition and environmental mastery compared to the standard ACS2. However, this efficiency gain is accompanied by increased computational overhead and a substantial expansion in classifier numerosity. This work provides the first analysis of combining anticipatory mechanisms with retrospective goal-relabeling in Learning Classifier Systems.

Abstract: We introduce a new method of generating Computer Aided Design (CAD) profiles via a sequence of simple geometric constructions including curve offsetting, rotations and intersections. These sequences start with geometry provided by a designer and build up the points and curves of the final profile step by step. We demonstrate that adding construction steps between the designer's input geometry and the final profile improves generation quality in a similar way to the introduction of a chain of thought in language models. Similar to the constraints in a parametric CAD model, the construction sequences reduce the degrees of freedom in the modeled shape to a small set of parameter values which can be adjusted by the designer, allowing parametric editing with the constructed geometry evaluated to floating point precision. In addition we show that applying reinforcement learning to the construction sequences gives further improvements over a wide range of metrics, including some which were not explicitly optimized.

Motivation: 光声成像中根据光传输反演组织吸收系数是重要但困难的逆问题。现有变分反演方法需要精确且可微的光传输模型，而神经替代模型虽能快速模拟复杂物理过程，但其导数准确性无法保证，这限制了在逆问题中的应用。准确导数对求解逆问题至关重要，因此需要提高替代模型导数的准确性以增强重建质量。

Result: Sobolev训练不仅提高了光传输替代模型的导数准确性，还降低了模型在分布内和分布外样本上的泛化误差。这些改进显著增强了替代模型在下游任务中的实用性，特别是在逆问题求解方面。

Conclusion: Sobolev训练是一种有效的方法，可以显著提高神经替代模型在光传输模拟中的导数准确性和泛化性能，为光声成像等高维逆问题的求解提供了更可靠的模型支持，有望增强光声成像的临床应用价值。

Abstract: In optoacoustic imaging, recovering the absorption coefficients of tissue by inverting the light transport remains a challenging problem. Improvements in solving this problem can greatly benefit the clinical value of optoacoustic imaging. Existing variational inversion methods require an accurate and differentiable model of this light transport. As neural surrogate models allow fast and differentiable simulations of complex physical processes, they are considered promising candidates to be used in solving such inverse problems. However, there are in general no guarantees that the derivatives of these surrogate models accurately match those of the underlying physical operator. As accurate derivatives are central to solving inverse problems, errors in the model derivative can considerably hinder high fidelity reconstructions. To overcome this limitation, we present a surrogate model for light transport in tissue that uses Sobolev training to improve the accuracy of the model derivatives. Additionally, the form of Sobolev training we used is suitable for high-dimensional models in general. Our results demonstrate that Sobolev training for a light transport surrogate model not only improves derivative accuracy but also reduces generalization error for in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples. These improvements promise to considerably enhance the utility of the surrogate model in downstream tasks, especially in solving inverse problems.

Abstract: Providing clear explanations to the choices of machine learning models is essential for these models to be deployed in crucial applications. Counterfactual and semi-factual explanations have emerged as two mechanisms for providing users with insights into the outputs of their models. We provide an overview of the computational complexity results in the literature for generating these explanations, finding that in many cases, generating explanations is computationally hard. We strengthen the argument for this considerably by further contributing our own inapproximability results showing that not only are explanations often hard to generate, but under certain assumptions, they are also hard to approximate. We discuss the implications of these complexity results for the XAI community and for policymakers seeking to regulate explanations in AI.

Conclusion: Searth Transformer+RAR策略为复杂全球地球物理环流系统的预测建模提供了强大算法基础，为地球系统科学开辟了新途径

Abstract: Accurate global medium-range weather forecasting is fundamental to Earth system science. Most existing Transformer-based forecasting models adopt vision-centric architectures that neglect the Earth's spherical geometry and zonal periodicity. In addition, conventional autoregressive training is computationally expensive and limits forecast horizons due to error accumulation. To address these challenges, we propose the Shifted Earth Transformer (Searth Transformer), a physics-informed architecture that incorporates zonal periodicity and meridional boundaries into window-based self-attention for physically consistent global information exchange. We further introduce a Relay Autoregressive (RAR) fine-tuning strategy that enables learning long-range atmospheric evolution under constrained memory and computational budgets. Based on these methods, we develop YanTian, a global medium-range weather forecasting model. YanTian achieves higher accuracy than the high-resolution forecast of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and performs competitively with state-of-the-art AI models at one-degree resolution, while requiring roughly 200 times lower computational cost than standard autoregressive fine-tuning. Furthermore, YanTian attains a longer skillful forecast lead time for Z500 (10.3 days) than HRES (9 days). Beyond weather forecasting, this work establishes a robust algorithmic foundation for predictive modeling of complex global-scale geophysical circulation systems, offering new pathways for Earth system science.

Abstract: Model merging enables multiple large language models (LLMs) to be combined into a single model while preserving performance. This makes it a valuable tool in LLM development, offering a competitive alternative to multi-task training. However, merging can be difficult at scale, as successful merging requires choosing the right merge operator, selecting the right models, and merging them in the right order. This often leads researchers to run expensive merge-and-evaluate searches to select the best merge. In this work, we provide an alternative by introducing \simmerge{}, \emph{a predictive merge-selection method} that selects the best merge using inexpensive, task-agnostic similarity signals between models. From a small set of unlabeled probes, we compute functional and structural features and use them to predict the performance of a given 2-way merge. Using these predictions, \simmerge{} selects the best merge operator, the subset of models to merge, and the merge order, eliminating the expensive merge-and-evaluate loop. We demonstrate that we surpass standard merge-operator performance on 2-way merges of 7B-parameter LLMs, and that \simmerge{} generalizes to multi-way merges and 111B-parameter LLM merges without retraining. Additionally, we present a bandit variant that supports adding new tasks, models, and operators on the fly. Our results suggest that learning how to merge is a practical route to scalable model composition when checkpoint catalogs are large and evaluation budgets are tight.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is becoming essential for building trustworthy and compliant language models. Yet unlearning success varies considerably across individual samples: some are reliably erased, while others persist despite the same procedure. We argue that this disparity is not only a data-side phenomenon, but also reflects model-internal mechanisms that encode and protect memorized information. We study this problem from a mechanistic perspective based on model circuits--structured interaction pathways that govern how predictions are formed. We propose Circuit-guided Unlearning Difficulty (CUD), a {\em pre-unlearning} metric that assigns each sample a continuous difficulty score using circuit-level signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CUD reliably separates intrinsically easy and hard samples, and remains stable across unlearning methods. We identify key circuit-level patterns that reveal a mechanistic signature of difficulty: easy-to-unlearn samples are associated with shorter, shallower interactions concentrated in earlier-to-intermediate parts of the original model, whereas hard samples rely on longer and deeper pathways closer to late-stage computation. Compared to existing qualitative studies, CUD takes a first step toward a principled, fine-grained, and interpretable analysis of unlearning difficulty; and motivates the development of unlearning methods grounded in model mechanisms.

TL;DR: 提出TOCFlow方法，通过最优控制框架解决预训练流模型的终端约束采样问题，避免了矩阵求逆并保持几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使用预训练流模型采样时，需要满足终端约束（如等式、不等式、统计约束），传统方法如欧几里得引导或投影在几何一致性和计算效率上存在局限。本文旨在开发几何感知的采样时间引导方法，在保持生成质量的同时提高约束满足度。

Method: 1. 建立最优控制理论框架，将约束采样问题表述为Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman方程；2. 提出TOCFlow算法，在跟踪参考轨迹的终端共动坐标系中求解控制问题；3. 推导沿黎曼梯度的闭式标量阻尼因子，捕获二阶曲率效应，无需矩阵求逆；4. 该方法在计算成本上与标准梯度引导相当，但几何一致性与高斯-牛顿更新匹配。

Result: 1. 理论层面：控制惩罚增大时，受控过程恢复参考分布；惩罚趋零时，终端定律收敛到约束流形上的广义Wasserstein投影；2. 实验层面：在Darcy流、约束轨迹规划、符合Kolmogorov谱标度的湍流快照生成三个高维科学任务上评估，涵盖等式、不等式和全局统计约束；3. TOCFlow在约束满足度上优于欧几里得引导和投影基线，同时保持参考模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: TOCFlow为预训练流模型提供了高效、几何一致的终端约束采样方法，理论严谨且实践有效，适用于多样化的高维科学应用场景。

Abstract: We address the problem of sampling from terminally constrained distributions with pre-trained flow-based generative models through an optimal control formulation. Theoretically, we characterize the value function by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and derive the optimal feedback control as the minimizer of the associated Hamiltonian. We show that as the control penalty increases, the controlled process recovers the reference distribution, while as the penalty vanishes, the terminal law converges to a generalized Wasserstein projection onto the constraint manifold. Algorithmically, we introduce Terminal Optimal Control with Flow-based models (TOCFlow), a geometry-aware sampling-time guidance method for pre-trained flows. Solving the control problem in a terminal co-moving frame that tracks reference trajectories yields a closed-form scalar damping factor along the Riemannian gradient, capturing second-order curvature effects without matrix inversions. TOCFlow therefore matches the geometric consistency of Gauss-Newton updates at the computational cost of standard gradient guidance. We evaluate TOCFlow on three high-dimensional scientific tasks spanning equality, inequality, and global statistical constraints, namely Darcy flow, constrained trajectory planning, and turbulence snapshot generation with Kolmogorov spectral scaling. Across all settings, TOCFlow improves constraint satisfaction over Euclidean guidance and projection baselines while preserving the reference model's generative quality.

Abstract: Deep Operator Networks are emerging as fundamental tools among various neural network types to learn mappings between function spaces, and have recently gained attention due to their ability to approximate nonlinear operators. In particular, DeepONets offer a natural formulation for PDE solving, since the solution of a partial differential equation can be interpreted as an operator mapping an initial condition to its corresponding solution field. In this work, we applied DeepONets in the context of process modeling for adsorption technologies, to assess their feasibility as surrogates for cyclic adsorption process simulation and optimization. The goal is to accelerate convergence of cyclic processes such as Temperature-Vacuum Swing Adsorption (TVSA), which require repeated solution of transient PDEs, which are computationally expensive. Since each step of a cyclic adsorption process starts from the final state of the preceding step, effective surrogate modeling requires generalization across a wide range of initial conditions. The governing equations exhibit steep traveling fronts, providing a demanding benchmark for operator learning. To evaluate functional generalization under these conditions, we construct a mixed training dataset composed of heterogeneous initial conditions and train DeepONets to approximate the corresponding solution operators. The trained models are then tested on initial conditions outside the parameter ranges used during training, as well as on completely unseen functional forms. The results demonstrate accurate predictions both within and beyond the training distribution, highlighting DeepONets as potential efficient surrogates for accelerating cyclic adsorption simulations and optimization workflows.

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) combined with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a promising direction for parameter-efficient deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). By sharing a single adapter across multiple tasks, one can significantly reduce storage overhead. However, this approach suffers from negative transfer, where conflicting gradient updates from distinct tasks degrade the performance of individual tasks compared to single-task fine-tuning. This problem is exacerbated in LoRA due to the low-rank constraint, which limits the optimization landscape's capacity to accommodate diverse task requirements. In this paper, we propose Ortho-LoRA, a gradient projection method specifically tailored for the bipartite structure of LoRA. Ortho-LoRA dynamically projects conflicting task gradients onto the orthogonal complement of each other within the intrinsic LoRA subspace. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark demonstrate that Ortho-LoRA effectively mitigates task interference, outperforming standard joint training and recovering 95\% of the performance gap between multi-task and single-task baselines with negligible computational overhead.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across a variety of tasks, yet they often suffer from unreliable probability estimates. As a result, they can be overconfident in their predictions. Conformal Prediction (CP) offers a principled framework for uncertainty quantification, yielding prediction sets with rigorous coverage guarantees. Existing conformal training methods optimize for overall set size, but shaping the prediction sets in a class-conditional manner is not straightforward and typically requires prior knowledge of the data distribution. In this work, we introduce Class Adaptive Conformal Training (CaCT), which formulates conformal training as an augmented Lagrangian optimization problem that adaptively learns to shape prediction sets class-conditionally without making any distributional assumptions. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, including standard and long-tailed image recognition as well as text classification, demonstrate that CaCT consistently outperforms prior conformal training methods, producing significantly smaller and more informative prediction sets while maintaining the desired coverage guarantees.

Abstract: Kernel-based methods are used in the context of Granger Causality to enable the identification of nonlinear causal relationships between time series variables. In this paper, we show that two state of the art kernel-based Granger Causality (GC) approaches can be theoretically unified under the framework of Kernel Principal Component Regression (KPCR), and introduce a method based on this unification, demonstrating that this approach can improve causal identification. Additionally, we introduce a Gaussian Process score-based model with Smooth Information Criterion penalisation on the marginal likelihood, and demonstrate improved performance over existing state of the art time-series nonlinear causal discovery methods. Furthermore, we propose a contemporaneous causal identification algorithm, fully based on GC, using the proposed score-based $GP_{SIC}$ method, and compare its performance to a state of the art contemporaneous time series causal discovery algorithm.

Abstract: Recent research suggests that looped Transformers have superior reasoning capabilities compared to standard deep architectures. Current approaches to training single-head looped architectures on benchmark tasks frequently fail or yield suboptimal performance due to a highly non-convex and irregular loss landscape. In these settings, optimization often stagnates in poor local minima and saddle points of the loss landscape, preventing the model from discovering the global minimum point. The internal mechanisms of these single-head looped transformer models remain poorly understood, and training them from scratch remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework that leverages Tsallis entropy and Hamiltonian dynamics to transform the geometry of the loss landscape. By treating the parameter updates as a physical flow, we successfully trained a single-head looped Transformer with model dimension $d = 8$ to solve induction head task with input sequence length of 1000 tokens. This success reveals the internal mechanism behind the superior reasoning capability.

Abstract: Tabular Foundation Models (TFMs) have recently shown strong in-context learning capabilities on structured data, achieving zero-shot performance comparable to traditional machine learning methods. We find that zero-shot TFMs already achieve strong performance, while the benefits of fine-tuning are highly model and data-dependent. Meta-learning and PEFT provide moderate gains under specific conditions, whereas full supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often reduces accuracy or calibration quality. This work presents the first comprehensive study of fine-tuning in TFMs across benchmarks including TALENT, OpenML-CC18, and TabZilla. We compare Zero-Shot, Meta-Learning, Supervised (SFT), and parameter-efficient (PEFT) approaches, analyzing how dataset factors such as imbalance, size, and dimensionality affect outcomes. Our findings cover performance, calibration, and fairness, offering practical guidelines on when fine-tuning is most beneficial and its limitations.

Abstract: Structure-based and ligand-based computational drug design have traditionally relied on disjoint data sources and modeling assumptions, limiting their joint use at scale. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Geometric Learning for Unified Computational Drug Design (ConGLUDe), a single contrastive geometric model that unifies structure- and ligand-based training. ConGLUDe couples a geometric protein encoder that produces whole-protein representations and implicit embeddings of predicted binding sites with a fast ligand encoder, removing the need for pre-defined pockets. By aligning ligands with both global protein representations and multiple candidate binding sites through contrastive learning, ConGLUDe supports ligand-conditioned pocket prediction in addition to virtual screening and target fishing, while being trained jointly on protein-ligand complexes and large-scale bioactivity data. Across diverse benchmarks, ConGLUDe achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot virtual screening performance in settings where no binding pocket information is provided as input, substantially outperforms existing methods on a challenging target fishing task, and demonstrates competitive ligand-conditioned pocket selection. These results highlight the advantages of unified structure-ligand training and position ConGLUDe as a step toward general-purpose foundation models for drug discovery.

Abstract: Unit tests are critical in the hardware design lifecycle to ensure that component design modules are functionally correct and conform to the specification before they are integrated at the system level. Thus developing unit tests targeting various design features requires deep understanding of the design functionality and creativity. When one or more unit tests expose a design failure, the debugging engineer needs to diagnose, localize, and debug the failure to ensure design correctness, which is often a painstaking and intense process. In this work, we introduce LAUDE, a unified unit-test generation and debugging framework for hardware designs that cross-pollinates the semantic understanding of the design source code with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of foundational Large-Language Models (LLMs). LAUDE integrates prompt engineering and design execution information to enhance its unit test generation accuracy and code debuggability. We apply LAUDE with closed- and open-source LLMs to a large corpus of buggy hardware design codes derived from the VerilogEval dataset, where generated unit tests detected bugs in up to 100% and 93% of combinational and sequential designs and debugged up to 93% and 84% of combinational and sequential designs, respectively.

### [85] [Revisiting Software Engineering Education in the Era of Large Language Models: A Curriculum Adaptation and Academic Integrity Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08857)
*Mustafa Degerli*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出一个理论框架和教学设计模型，分析生成式AI如何改变核心软件工程能力，特别针对土耳其计算机工程教育中的挑战，主张从传统编程教学转向AI协同的批判性思维和过程透明度模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（如ChatGPT、GitHub Copilot）正在重塑软件工程实践，降低了代码生成、解释和测试的成本，但大多数软件工程和计算机工程课程仍沿用将手动编写语法等同于技术能力的教学模式。这种日益增长的不匹配引发了关于评估有效性、学习成果和基础技能发展的担忧，特别是在土耳其这种具有集中监管、大班教学和应试导向评估的教育环境中问题更加突出。

Method: 采用概念研究方法，提出了一个理论框架来分析生成式AI如何改变核心软件工程能力，并引入了一个LLM整合教育的教学设计模型。重点分析了问题分析、设计、实现和测试等环节如何从传统的“构建”转向“批判、验证和人类-AI协同管理”。

Result: 文章构建了一个结构化的课程调整方案，提出传统以抄袭为中心的诚信机制已不足够，需要向过程透明度模型过渡。该框架详细描述了软件工程核心能力在AI时代的转变路径，为教育转型提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 本文是一项理论研究贡献，为LLM整合教育提供了结构化的课程适应建议。但作者强调需要进行纵向实证研究来评估这些干预措施及其对学习的长期影响，从而验证理论框架的有效性。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, into professional workflows is increasingly reshaping software engineering practices. These tools have lowered the cost of code generation, explanation, and testing, while introducing new forms of automation into routine development tasks. In contrast, most of the software engineering and computer engineering curricula remain closely aligned with pedagogical models that equate manual syntax production with technical competence. This growing misalignment raises concerns regarding assessment validity, learning outcomes, and the development of foundational skills. Adopting a conceptual research approach, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing how generative AI alters core software engineering competencies and introduces a pedagogical design model for LLM-integrated education. Attention is given to computer engineering programs in Turkey, where centralized regulation, large class sizes, and exam-oriented assessment practices amplify these challenges. The framework delineates how problem analysis, design, implementation, and testing increasingly shift from construction toward critique, validation, and human-AI stewardship. In addition, the paper argues that traditional plagiarism-centric integrity mechanisms are becoming insufficient, motivating a transition toward a process transparency model. While this work provides a structured proposal for curriculum adaptation, it remains a theoretical contribution; the paper concludes by outlining the need for longitudinal empirical studies to evaluate these interventions and their long-term impacts on learning.

TL;DR: EZInput是一个跨运行时环境的Python库，允许算法开发者通过声明式规范自动生成GUI，使计算工具无需编程知识即可访问，支持Jupyter、Colab和终端环境，提升可重复性和用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人员在应用计算算法时面临参数配置的持续障碍：需要编程技能、不同环境界面各异、设置难以在会话间持久保存，导致重复输入、迭代探索缓慢，且因参数选择难以记录和共享而损害可重复性。

Method: 提出EZInput库，采用声明式规范系统，开发者只需定义一次输入需求和验证约束；库自动处理环境检测、界面渲染、参数验证和会话持久化，支持Jupyter Notebooks、Google Colab和终端环境。

Result: 实现了“一次编写，到处运行”的架构，使研究人员能在笔记本中原型设计，并在远程系统上以相同参数配置进行批处理执行，无需代码修改或手动转录；参数持久化通过轻量级YAML文件保存和恢复用户配置。

Conclusion: EZInput通过自动GUI生成、跨环境统一界面和参数持久化，显著降低了计算工具的使用门槛，减少了冗余输入，提高了科学工作流的可重复性和协作效率。

Abstract: Researchers face a persistent barrier when applying computational algorithms with parameter configuration typically demanding programming skills, interfaces differing across environments, and settings rarely persisting between sessions. This fragmentation forces repetitive input, slows iterative exploration, and undermines reproducibility because parameter choices are difficult to record, share, and reuse. We present EZInput, a cross-runtime environment Python library enabling algorithm developers to automatically generate graphical user interfaces that make their computational tools accessible to end-users without programming expertise. EZInput employs a declarative specification system where developers define input requirements and validation constraints once; the library then handles environment detection, interface rendering, parameter validation, and session persistence across Jupyter notebooks, Google Colab, and terminal environments. This "write once, run anywhere" architecture enables researchers to prototype in notebooks and deploy identical parameter configurations for batch execution on remote systems without code changes or manual transcription. Parameter persistence, inspired by ImageJ/FIJI and adapted to Python workflows, saves and restores user configurations via lightweight YAML files, eliminating redundant input and producing shareable records that enhance reproducibility. EZInput supports diverse input types essential for scientific computing and it also includes built-in validation that ensures data integrity and clear feedback that reduces user friction.

Abstract: OpenACC lowers the barrier to GPU offloading, but writing high-performing pragma remains complex, requiring deep domain expertise in memory hierarchies, data movement, and parallelization strategies. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising potential solution for automated parallel code generation, but naive prompting often results in syntactically incorrect directives, uncompilable code, or performance that fails to exceed CPU baselines. We present a systematic prompt optimization approach to enhance OpenACC pragma generation without the prohibitive computational costs associated with model post-training. Leveraging the GEPA (GEnetic-PAreto) framework, we iteratively evolve prompts through a reflective feedback loop. This process utilizes crossover and mutation of instructions, guided by expert-curated gold examples and structured feedback based on clause- and clause parameter-level mismatches between the gold and predicted pragma. In our evaluation on the PolyBench suite, we observe an increase in compilation success rates for programs annotated with OpenACC pragma generated using the optimized prompts compared to those annotated using the simpler initial prompt, particularly for the "nano"-scale models. Specifically, with optimized prompts, the compilation success rate for GPT-4.1 Nano surged from 66.7% to 93.3%, and for GPT-5 Nano improved from 86.7% to 100%, matching or surpassing the capabilities of their significantly larger, more expensive versions. Beyond compilation, the optimized prompts resulted in a 21% increase in the number of programs that achieve functional GPU speedups over CPU baselines. These results demonstrate that prompt optimization effectively unlocks the potential of smaller, cheaper LLMs in writing stable and effective GPU-offloading directives, establishing a cost-effective pathway to automated directive-based parallelization in HPC workflows.

Abstract: Open source C code underpins society's computing infrastructure. Decades of work has helped harden C code against attackers, but C projects do not consist of only C code. C projects also contain build system code for automating development tasks like compilation, testing, and packaging. These build systems are critcal to software supply chain security and vulnerable to being poisoned, with the XZ Utils and SolarWinds attacks being recent examples. Existing techniques try to harden software supply chains by verifying software dependencies, but such methods ignore the build system itself. Similarly, classic software security checkers only analyze and monitor program code, not build system code. Moreover, poisoned build systems can easily circumvent tools for detecting program code vulnerabilities by disabling such checks. We present development phase isolation, a novel strategy for hardening build systems against poisoning by modeling the information and behavior permissions of build automation as if it were program code. We have prototyped this approach as a tool called Foreman, which successfully detects and warns about the poisoned test files involved in the XZ Utils attack. We outline our future plans to protect against pipeline poisoning by automatically checking development phase isolation. We envision a future where build system security checkers are as prevalent as program code checkers.

TL;DR: 探究LLM生成测试中不稳定性测试的普遍性、原因及传递性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM测试生成研究指出不稳定性是潜在问题，但其普遍性和根本原因尚不明确，特别是在关系数据库管理系统背景下，需要评估生成测试的不稳定性特征以指导开发者实践。

Method: 选取SAP HANA、DuckDB、MySQL和SQLite四种关系数据库管理系统，使用GPT-4o和Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407两个LLM对测试套件进行扩增，通过人工检查识别不稳定性测试的根本原因。

Result: 生成测试中不稳定测试比例略高于现有测试；人工检查发现63%的不稳定测试根源于"无序集合"依赖（即测试依赖于未保证的顺序）；LLM通过提示上下文将现有测试的不稳定性传递至新生成测试，且传递现象在SAP HANA等闭源系统中更为普遍。

Conclusion: LLM生成测试的不稳定性主要源于无序集合依赖，且会从现有测试传递至新测试；研究结果为开发者提供了预期不稳定性类型的指导，并强调了为LLM提供定制化上下文在测试生成中的重要性。

Abstract: Flaky tests are a common problem in software testing. They produce inconsistent results when executed multiple times on the same code, invalidating the assumption that a test failure indicates a software defect. Recent work on LLM-based test generation has identified flakiness as a potential problem with generated tests. However, its prevalence and underlying causes are unclear. We examined the flakiness of LLM-generated tests in the context of four relational database management systems: SAP HANA, DuckDB, MySQL, and SQLite. We amplified test suites with two LLMs, GPT-4o and Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407, to assess the flakiness of the generated test cases. Our results suggest that generated tests have a slightly higher proportion of flaky tests compared to existing tests. Based on a manual inspection, we found that the most common root cause of flakiness was the reliance of a test on a certain order that is not guaranteed ("unordered collection"), which was present in 72 of 115 flaky tests (63%). Furthermore, both LLMs transferred the flakiness from the existing tests to the newly generated tests via the provided prompt context. Our experiments suggest that flakiness transfer is more prevalent in closed-source systems such as SAP HANA than in open-source systems. Our study informs developers on what types of flakiness to expect from LLM-generated tests. It also highlights the importance of providing LLMs with tailored context when employing LLMs for test generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对自动驾驶系统Plan模型存在的安全关键缺陷，需要系统化的测试方法来生成结构上有意义的测试场景并有效检测危险规划行为，以确保ADS的安全性。

Method: 1. 对Plan模型实现进行结构分析（场景转换逻辑和分层控制流）以提取可行的场景转换；2. 将这些转换与非玩家车辆行为组合生成测试场景；3. 应用引导式模糊测试来探索Plan模型在这些场景下的行为空间。

Result: 在百度Apollo系统（L4级ADS）上进行评估：生成了20635个测试用例，检测到520个危险行为，通过手动分析归为15个根本原因；针对其中4个问题应用补丁后问题消失且无明显副作用；实现了83.63%的函数覆盖率和63.22%的决策覆盖率，在错误发现和效率方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SafePlanner框架能够有效识别自动驾驶系统Plan模型中的安全关键缺陷，通过结构分析和引导式模糊测试的组合方法，在实际生产级ADS中展示了出色的测试覆盖率和错误检测能力。

Abstract: In this work, we present SafePlanner, a systematic testing framework for identifying safety-critical flaws in the Plan model of Automated Driving Systems (ADS). SafePlanner targets two core challenges: generating structurally meaningful test scenarios and detecting hazardous planning behaviors. To maximize coverage, SafePlanner performs a structural analysis of the Plan model implementation - specifically, its scene-transition logic and hierarchical control flow - and uses this insight to extract feasible scene transitions from code. It then composes test scenarios by combining these transitions with non-player vehicle (NPC) behaviors. Guided fuzzing is applied to explore the behavioral space of the Plan model under these scenarios. We evaluate SafePlanner on Baidu Apollo, a production-grade level 4 ADS. It generates 20635 test cases and detects 520 hazardous behaviors, grouped into 15 root causes through manual analysis. For four of these, we applied patches based on our analysis; the issues disappeared, and no apparent side effects were observed. SafePlanner achieves 83.63 percent function and 63.22 percent decision coverage on the Plan model, outperforming baselines in both bug discovery and efficiency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The transition from Cloud-Native to AI-Native architectures is fundamentally reshaping software engineering, replacing deterministic microservices with probabilistic agentic services. However, this shift renders traditional black-box evaluation paradigms insufficient: existing benchmarks measure raw model capabilities while remaining blind to system-level execution dynamics. To bridge this gap, we introduce AI-NativeBench, the first application-centric and white-box AI-Native benchmark suite grounded in Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) standards. By treating agentic spans as first-class citizens within distributed traces, our methodology enables granular analysis of engineering characteristics beyond simple capabilities. Leveraging this benchmark across 21 system variants, we uncover critical engineering realities invisible to traditional metrics: a parameter paradox where lightweight models often surpass flagships in protocol adherence, a pervasive inference dominance that renders protocol overhead secondary, and an expensive failure pattern where self-healing mechanisms paradoxically act as cost multipliers on unviable workflows. This work provides the first systematic evidence to guide the transition from measuring model capability to engineering reliable AI-Native systems. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we have open-sourced the benchmark and dataset.

TL;DR: DepRadar是一个用于深度学习库细粒度缺陷和影响分析的智能体协调框架，通过多智能体协作从库更新中提取缺陷语义并分析对下游程序的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习库如Transformers和Megatron在现代AI程序中广泛使用，但当这些库引入缺陷（从静默计算错误到微妙性能退化）时，下游用户很难评估自己的程序是否受到影响。影响分析不仅需要理解缺陷语义，还需要检查客户端代码是否满足涉及配置标志、运行时环境和间接API使用的复杂触发条件。

Method: DepRadar协调四个专业智能体执行三个步骤：1）PR Miner和Code Diff Analyzer从提交或拉取请求中提取结构化缺陷语义；2）Orchestrator Agent将这些信号合成为统一的缺陷模式及触发条件；3）Impact Analyzer检查下游程序以确定缺陷是否可被触发。它集成了静态分析和DL特定领域规则以提高准确性和可解释性。

Result: 在涵盖两个代表性DL库的157个PR和70个提交上评估，DepRadar在缺陷识别上达到90%的精确度，并生成高质量结构化字段（平均字段评分1.6）。在122个客户端程序上，DepRadar识别受影响案例的召回率为90%，精确度为80%，显著优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: DepRadar框架能够有效分析深度学习库更新中的缺陷及其对下游程序的影响，通过多智能体协作和领域特定规则实现了高精度的缺陷识别和影响分析，为深度学习库的维护和质量保障提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Deep learning libraries like Transformers and Megatron are now widely adopted in modern AI programs. However, when these libraries introduce defects, ranging from silent computation errors to subtle performance regressions, it is often challenging for downstream users to assess whether their own programs are affected. Such impact analysis requires not only understanding the defect semantics but also checking whether the client code satisfies complex triggering conditions involving configuration flags, runtime environments, and indirect API usage. We present DepRadar, an agent coordination framework for fine grained defect and impact analysis in DL library updates. DepRadar coordinates four specialized agents across three steps: 1. the PR Miner and Code Diff Analyzer extract structured defect semantics from commits or pull requests, 2. the Orchestrator Agent synthesizes these signals into a unified defect pattern with trigger conditions, and 3. the Impact Analyzer checks downstream programs to determine whether the defect can be triggered. To improve accuracy and explainability, DepRadar integrates static analysis with DL-specific domain rules for defect reasoning and client side tracing. We evaluate DepRadar on 157 PRs and 70 commits across two representative DL libraries. It achieves 90% precision in defect identification and generates high quality structured fields (average field score 1.6). On 122 client programs, DepRadar identifies affected cases with 90% recall and 80% precision, substantially outperforming other baselines.

Abstract: Domain-specific metadata schemas are essential to improve the findability and reusability of research software and to follow the FAIR4RS principles. However, many domains, including energy research, lack established metadata schemas. To address this gap, we developed a metadata schema for energy research software based on a requirement analysis and evaluated it through user testing. Our results show that the schema balances the need for formalization and interoperability, while also meeting the specific needs of energy researchers. Meanwhile, the testing showed that a good presentation of the required information is key to enable researchers to create the required metadata. This paper provides insights into the challenges and opportunities of designing a metadata schema for energy research software.

Result: 识别出13个关键挑战，包括管道开发与集成、bug修复、基因组数据集成、CI配置管理、版本更新等；89.38%的问题最终关闭，50%在3天内解决；标签（大效应，δ=0.94）和代码片段（中效应，δ=0.50）显著提高解决概率；工具开发和仓库维护是最主要挑战。

Conclusion: 这项研究为nf-core管道的协作开发和维护提供了可操作的见解，强调了改善管道可用性、可持续性和可重现性的机会，特别是通过采用标签系统和代码片段分享来优化问题解决流程。

Abstract: Scientific Workflow Management Systems (SWfMSs) such as Nextflow have become essential software frameworks for conducting reproducible, scalable, and portable computational analyses in data-intensive fields like genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. Building on Nextflow, the nf-core community curates standardized, peer-reviewed pipelines that follow strict testing, documentation, and governance guidelines. Despite its broad adoption, little is known about the challenges users face during the development and maintenance of these pipelines. This paper presents an empirical study of 25,173 issues and pull requests from these pipelines to uncover recurring challenges, management practices, and perceived difficulties. Using BERTopic modeling, we identify 13 key challenges, including pipeline development and integration, bug fixing, integrating genomic data, managing CI configurations, and handling version updates. We then examine issue resolution dynamics, showing that 89.38\% of issues and pull requests are eventually closed, with half resolved within three days. Statistical analysis reveals that the presence of labels (large effect, $δ$ = 0.94) and code snippets (medium effect, $δ$ = 0.50) significantly improve resolution likelihood. Further analysis reveals that tool development and repository maintenance poses the most significant challenges, followed by testing pipelines and CI configurations, and debugging containerized pipelines. Overall, this study provides actionable insights into the collaborative development and maintenance of nf-core pipelines, highlighting opportunities to enhance their usability, sustainability, and reproducibility.

Conclusion: SysPro通过自动化提取缺陷报告中的关键信息并生成对应输入，有效解决了系统级并发缺陷难以复现的挑战。

Abstract: Reproducing system-level concurrency bugs requires both input data and the precise interleaving order of system calls. This process is challenging because such bugs are non-deterministic, and bug reports often lack the detailed information needed. Additionally, the unstructured nature of reports written in natural language makes it difficult to extract necessary details. Existing tools are inadequate to reproduce these bugs due to their inability to manage the specific interleaving at the system call level. To address these challenges, we propose SysPro, a novel approach that automatically extracts relevant system call names from bug reports and identifies their locations in the source code. It generates input data by utilizing information retrieval, regular expression matching, and the category-partition method. This extracted input and interleaving data are then used to reproduce bugs through dynamic source code instrumentation. Our empirical study on real-world benchmarks demonstrates that SysPro is both effective and efficient at localizing and reproducing system-level concurrency bugs from bug reports.

TL;DR: 该论文研究发现，在单元测试生成中，直接使用强大的新版LLM（朴素方法）比现有的增强技术（如HITS、SymPrompt等）更有效且成本相当，并提出基于类方法的优化策略以降低LLM调用次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-based测试生成技术常依赖后处理（编译执行反馈）来提升质量，但这些研究多基于较旧的LLM版本和弱提示进行评估，未能验证新技术在更强LLM下的必要性。作者怀疑新版LLM可能已能独立高效生成测试，使得现有技术优势不再显著。

Method: 复现四种SOTA LLM测试生成工具（HITS、SymPrompt、TestSpark、CoverUp），并将它们与朴素LLM方法（直接使用新版LLM）对比。在393个类和3,657个方法上评估效果（行覆盖、分支覆盖、突变分数）和效率（LLM调用次数）。进一步探索粒度（类级vs方法级）对成本的影响，并提出了先覆盖类、再补充未覆盖方法的策略。

Result: 朴素LLM方法在所有效果指标上均优于现有技术：行覆盖提升17.72%，分支覆盖提升19.80%，突变分数提升20.92%，且LLM调用次数相当。研究还发现，在类级别生成测试比在方法级别更高效；采用先类后方法的策略可保持略高的效果，同时减少约20%的LLM请求。

Conclusion: 新版LLM的强大能力使得直接使用朴素方法进行测试生成已能超越现有依赖复杂反馈机制的技术。这表明未来研究应更注重如何高效利用LLM本身，而非过度设计后处理流程。论文提出的类优先策略为降低调用成本提供了实用方向。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has strongly impacted software engineering, leading to a growing number of studies on automated unit test generation. However, the standalone use of LLMs without post-processing has proven insufficient, often producing tests that fail to compile or achieve high coverage. Several techniques have been proposed to address these issues, reporting improvements in test compilation and coverage. While important, LLM-based test generation techniques have been evaluated against relatively weak baselines (for todays' standards), i.e., old LLM versions and relatively weak prompts, which may exacerbate the performance contribution of the approaches. In other words, stronger (newer) LLMs may obviate any advantage these techniques bring. We investigate this issue by replicating four state-of-the-art LLM-based test generation tools, HITS, SymPrompt, TestSpark, and CoverUp that include engineering components aimed at guiding the test generation process through compilation and execution feedback, and evaluate their relative effectiveness and efficiency over a plain LLM test generation method. We integrate current LLM versions in all approaches and run an experiment on 393 classes and 3,657 methods. Our results show that the plain LLM approach can outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches in all test effectiveness metrics we used: line coverage (by 17.72%), branch coverage (by 19.80%) and mutation score (by 20.92%), and it does so at a comparable cost (LLM queries). We also observe that the granularity at which the plain LLM is applied has a significant impact on the cost. We therefore propose targeting first the program classes, where test generation is more efficient, and then the uncovered methods to reduce the number of LLM requests. This strategy achieves comparable (slightly higher) effectiveness while requiring about 20% fewer LLM requests.

Abstract: Code generation tasks aim to automate the conversion of user requirements into executable code, significantly reducing manual development efforts and enhancing software productivity. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code generation, though their efficiency is still impacted by certain inherent architectural constraints. Each token generation necessitates a complete inference pass, requiring persistent retention of contextual information in memory and escalating resource consumption. While existing research prioritizes inference-phase optimizations such as prompt compression and model quantization, the generation phase remains underexplored. To tackle these challenges, we propose a knowledge-infused framework named ShortCoder, which optimizes code generation efficiency while preserving semantic equivalence and readability. In particular, we introduce: (1) ten syntax-level simplification rules for Python, derived from AST-preserving transformations, achieving 18.1% token reduction without functional compromise; (2) a hybrid data synthesis pipeline integrating rule-based rewriting with LLM-guided refinement, producing ShorterCodeBench, a corpus of validated tuples of original code and simplified code with semantic consistency; (3) a fine-tuning strategy that injects conciseness awareness into the base LLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ShortCoder consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on HumanEval, achieving an improvement of 18.1%-37.8% in generation efficiency over previous methods while ensuring the performance of code generation.
